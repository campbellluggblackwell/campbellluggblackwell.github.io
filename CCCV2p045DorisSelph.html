      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>Since my last letter which was written at the very outset of my college
        days, six months ago, I have grown more enthusiastic than ever over
        college life. The work is hard, of course, but we enjoy our many
        activities all the more because of that.</p>
      <p>Just the other night, we had our first "bacon bat" of the season. Armed
        with enough utensils and food to start a small housekeeping
        establishment, we hiked about a mile to a place on the shore of our
        reservoir where we are allowed to build a fire<sup>1</sup>. I was
        reminded of camp days as we ate and sang and watched the sun set.</p>
      <p>Two weeks ago, I was home for my Spring vacation. One day, <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Daddy</a>
        and I saw one of the most gorgeous sights of our lives. This was the
        International Flower Show in New York City. The most beautiful exhibits
        were arranged as regular gardens. Between the large pillars of the
        building real sods had been placed; while brooks and fountains and paths
        laid down between the flowers added much to the charm. Some of these
        were typical American gardens and there was also an Italian and a
        Japanese garden. </p>
      <p> New York's theaters<sup>2</sup> attracted us too and we enjoyed the
        French play, "Cyrano de Bergerac," "The Miracle" and "The Ten
        Commandments."&nbsp; </p>
      <p> We are now busy making preparations for our annual May Day Pageant
        here. One of the seniors wrote this year's performance: - "The Evolution
        of May Day." I am especially looking forward to this event because I am
        expecting that <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1604">Mother</a>
        will be with me.</p>
      <p>I hope that you will all have the nicest kind of summer vacation.<br>
      </p>

      1. Several years ago, while visiting friends in Norton, my wife and I
      drove around the Weaton College campus. I'd read this letter, so kept a
      lookout for the spot where Doris had her campfire. I'm reasonably sure we
      found it, which made me feel connected to Doris - wbt.<br>
