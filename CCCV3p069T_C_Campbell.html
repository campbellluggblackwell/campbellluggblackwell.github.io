      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> Here we go again--broadcasting! And it finds Fran and myself verging
        on our seventies, but still feeling young and active in the social and
        business welfare of our Sunshine City. This we do not attribute entirely
        to the fact that that we drink daily from the "Fountain of Youth", but
        to our daily plunge into the warm salt waters of the bay or gulf that
        surrounds us, and to the most wonderful climate all the year around that
        is known to man. Then I believe a fellow lives longer if he is content
        and happy. And why shouldn't we be, blessed as we are with our children
        and grandchildren, all pleasantly located close by us where they too,
        are enjoying health and the many blessings this wonderful climate gives?
      </p>
      <p> Sister <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Kate</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I787">Lish</a>
        have spent the winter here, and just recently moved into a nice new
        bungalow which they have been building this winter. Both are apparently
        as happy as a newly married couple just starting housekeeping. We
        certainly have enjoyed having them with us this winter. We are looking
        forward with much pleasure to the coming winter, for we shall have
        Sister Mary with us then too. Cousins <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a>
        and <a href="VaughanEmma1854.html">Em Congdon</a> were here this winter
        and we hope they liked liked so well that they will come again. This
        winter we organized here a little society called the "Cowanesque
        Circle", made up of those who have lived at some time during their life
        in the old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowanesque_River">Cowanesque
          Valley</a>. We were surprised to find we had over sixty active
        members. At the last meeting there were reported fifteen more known
        eligibles. </p>
      <p> The population of our city is now thirty-seven thousand. We
        entertained over one hundred thousand tourist this winter. We have one
        hundred miles of paving and two hundred miles of sidewalk<sup>1</sup>.
        Our streets are nearly all one hundred feet wide and lined with palms
        and other tropical foliage which is in bloom practically the whole year
        round. Our summers are warm, not hot, never above ninety-six degrees and
        seldom above ninety degrees, while a cool breeze from the bay or gulf at
        night makes sleeping very comfortable. One nearly always needs a light
        blanket over him at night. No one ever has a sunstroke in Florida, while
        they are numerous in almost every northern city. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>1. Having paved roads and extensive sidewalks was something to brag
        about in 1925. As was having wide streets.</p>

      <p>I think every known church society has a church here, and every known
        secret organization has a lodge here<sup>2</sup>. Nearly every known
        amusement is here. We have six large golf courses, boating and fishing
        that is the best in the world. Something like twenty tons of fresh fish
        in refrigeration is shipped from here daily to all points north. They
        get some big ones occasionally. These are usually hung up on the end of
        Municipal Pier for a few hours, when first caught, as an exhibition for
        the tourists. During the last week there have been two fish, each over
        twelve feet long, hung up for a few hours in the evening where thousands
        of autoloads pass around the end of the pier to view them.</p>
      <p>Our winters are free from rain and full of sunshine. We have about two
        months of rainy weather in the summer; not steady rain, but several
        showers daily. The sun is out immediately afterward, and in a short time
        one wouldn't know it had rained in a week. There is no garden vegetable
        grown, that we do not have in abundance the year round. All food stuffs
        are as cheap as in the North except, possibly, milk, butter, cheese and
        eggs. Rents are simply nothing during the summer season, but extremely
        high during the winter. This is because we have to get a year's rental
        out of our property in five or six months. We just love it here and
        would not go back north to live if we were given the best home in the
        Cowanesque Valley.</p>
      <p> We are only a couple of days ride<sup>3</sup> from our New York and
        Pennsylvania friends. We often wonder why more of our friends and
        relatives do not come here for the winter, possibly adding a few more
        years to their lives. We extend to you all a most cordial invitation to
        come and drink from the "Fountain of Youth". <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">Frank</a>
        joins in sending our love to each of you.</p>

      <p>2. It's clear what Tommie means. But the combo "known secret" sounds
        like a contradiction.</p>
      <p>3. It was a couple of days <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ride</span>
        by train. To <span style="text-decoration: underline;">drive</span>
        took about twice as long.</p>
