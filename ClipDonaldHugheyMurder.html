            <p class="SecndP">&nbsp;&nbsp; A shooting incident in a crowded <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakridge,_Oregon">Oakridge</a>
              bar Friday night left one man dead, and his apparent assailant in
              custody of Oakridge police.</p>
            <p class="SecndP">&nbsp;&nbsp; Patrons of the bar, Bink's, wrestled
              the unidentified gunman to the floor following the shooting,
              knocked him unconscious, and held him until police arrived,
              according to Jack Moses, co-owner of Bink's.</p>
            <p class="SecndP">&nbsp;&nbsp; The dead man is <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1229">Donald
                Hughey</a>, of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Bay,_Oregon">Winchester
                Bay</a>, a former resident of Oakridge, Moses said. He was
              brought to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene,_Oregon">Eugene</a>
              by ambulance early this morning and died on the way.</p>
            <p class="SecndP">&nbsp;&nbsp; The identity of the arrested man was
              unavailable from police.</p>
            <p class="SecndP">&nbsp;&nbsp; Moses said he was tending bar about
              11:30 p.m. when a man came in, sat at the bar next to Hughey and
              started arguing for no apparent reason. Moses said he walked
              around the bar and asked the man if there was any problem.</p>
            <p class="SecndP">&nbsp;&nbsp; "He told me to let go of his arm or
              he was going to shoot the guy," Moses said, "And I looked down and
              saw he had a pistol under Don's armpit."</p>
            <p class="SecndP">&nbsp;&nbsp; Moses said he immediately went to
              call police, and while he was on the phone he heard a shot.
              Returning to the bar, he saw Hughey unconscious on the floor, he
              said.</p>
            <p class="SecndP">&nbsp;&nbsp; Several patrons among about 70 in the
              bar grabbed the man, Moses said, and in the struggle the assailant
              was knocked out and one customer was slightly injured.</p>
