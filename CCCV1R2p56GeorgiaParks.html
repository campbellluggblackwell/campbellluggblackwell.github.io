            face="Courier, monospace"><font size="4">Dear Cousins:-<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want first to say that I am
              very glad that I belong to the Campbells even if it is
              only forty&#8209;secondly. I still feel a pride in the fact. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was never more thrilled in my
              life than the one time I met with you all there in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Township,_Tioga_County,_Pennsylvania">Nelson</a>
              and realized that all the good looking people around the
              tables were my relations. You people who have been able to
              meet year after year in that way have no idea what these
              letters mean to us, who are so far away and I think <a
                href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a> is doing a
              fine thing in keeping up the family love and pride by
              these letters. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was a very small girl when we
              left Nelson for Brainerd, Minnesota, which was then the
              far West, as I know my poor <a
                href="VaughanEmma1854.html">Mother</a> felt then, but
              some of the impressions made before that on my childish
              mind have always remained. My dear <a
                href="CampbellSarah1824.html">Grandmother</a>, "Aunt
              Sally", as every one else called her, has always seemed a
              very real person to me, and I can see her yet, getting
              ready for church, putting a few peppermints in her pocket
              for me and a few cloves for herself; then the lovely walk
              down the road and through the old covered bridge, and then
              the visits among the relatives and friends. Reading over
              these letters has seemed almost like some of those visits
              where each one was mentioned and their joys and sorrows
              stared. I often wonder if we are not missing a great deal
              by not having more of these friendly visits. We of the
              West at least seem always in a hurry and must have
              something doing all the time. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The West is beautiful and I am
              sure there could never be any other home for me now. Our
              place which we have named "Firmond" is just about an
              hour's ride by ferry from Seattle, where my husband is
              employed in the Alaska Steamship Company offices, and
              where, by the way, we have a fine market for all our
              produce, said produce being mostly flowers. Our gardens
              today are still ablaze of color and I am sending in
              baskets of flowers every day. Roses are in bloom all down
              the path to the front gate while beyond the gate stretch
              the blue waters of Puget Sound. In the distance on the
              left are the snow capped Olympics and on the right the
              Cascades with old Mt. Ranier in their midst. Do you wonder
              we love it even in the rainy weather? </font></font></p>

            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had a very busy summer and
            many times have picked as many as two hundred bunches of
            sweet peas a day. I can pick thirty five bunches an hour,&#8209;
            that means about twelve hundred stems. The stems are about
            eight or ten inches long and four or five blooms on a stem,
            and the vines grow nine or ten feet high. I wonder if they
            grow like that in the East. Our greatest trouble, as I
            suppose it is with you, is to get help.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was so interested in <a
              href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Cousin Tommie</a>'s letter
            because they too are on the ocean beach. It must be lovely
            there.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We take a little pleasure trip every
            now and then to Alaska which, by the way, I will say to all
            the Cousins is one of the finest trips in the world if one
            is not afraid of the water. So you see what in my childhood
            days was the "Far West" has become East to me; the prairies
            and lakes which I loved then have been supplanted by
            mountains and ocean.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do miss the relatives; there are
            none of our own family here except our immediate family and
            I was delighted to know <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Cousin







              Kate</a>'s family were in Oregon. Come up some time.
            Perhaps some of you may come West some day and if you do, be
            sure to look up little old Harper and your country Cousins.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am sorry we had no pictures to
            send; will try to get some finished in time but if not will
            put them in the next letter.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be more than glad to bear
            our portion of the expense attached to this Correspondence,
            and are looking forward to the next letter with great
            pleasure.<br>
