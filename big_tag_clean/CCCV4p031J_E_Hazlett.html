        Dear Cousins:-

    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        After receiving your splendid letter book of Cousins' letters fr which
        I am very grateful and a couple of letters from Cousin <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a>, urging me to write a letter for
        the book, I am now seated at a desk that has served three generations
        of the Hazlett family and is more than one hundred years old. And this
        old house that will soon reach the century mark has sheltered the same
        generations of our family. I would be loath to leave it, for the old
        fashioned brass door nobs and ancient latches have become very dear to
        me - in fact, a part of my life. You know wherever we may roam or where
        our lot may be cast as men and women those childhood haunts where we
        fished and swam and played in youth are always home. I look out and
        over the fields that were cleared by other hands so long ago - more
        than a century, - and the trees planted in the distant past, - and I am
        reminded that we are building for others. We are gathering the harvest
        of their toil, therefore, we should plant and sow and labor for the
        generations yet unborn.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am afraid my letter is getting too long but I wish to speak of one
        more place that I know is dear to everyone of the <a href=
        "CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph Campbell</a> Cousins It is the old
        church<sup>1</sup> on the top of the hill where all of us attended in
        childhood. It is not a beautiful building but some how it looks good
        for its associations. My <a href=

        father</a> cut the first tree that went into the frame. Our
        congregation is small but we are keeping it open for all who wish to
        come.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will close by wishing you all the best that the world affords. I wish
        to state that Joseph Campbell's <a href=
        "CampbellJane1792.html">sister</a> was my grandmother.
