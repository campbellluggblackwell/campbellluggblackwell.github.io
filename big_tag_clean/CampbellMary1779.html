      <big>Mary CAMPBELL Hazlett (1779 - 1824)<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>Mary was born Mar. 19, 1779, in Scotland or N. Ireland; d. Apr. 10,
      1824, in Lancaster Co., PA. She married in Lancaster Co. or N. Ireland to
      a <a href=
      "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I12">
      John Hazlett</a> who was born in County Down, N. Ireland. We have no
      evidence that he was related to the <a href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John
      Hazlett</a> that married Mary's sister, <a href=
      "CampbellJane1792.html">Jane Campbell</a>, or to the <a href=
      "HazlettSamuel1780.html">Samuel Hazlett</a> that married Mary's sister
      <a href="CampbellSarah1777.html">Sarah</a> (called "Sally").<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>Mary was the 2nd of 8 children of</big> <big><a href=
      "CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph Campbell</a>, b. 1748, in Scotland, d.
      1824 in Nelson, PA, (originally called <a href=
      "BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's Island</a>); and <a href=
      "HarperMary1749.html">Mary Harper</a>, b. 1749, in Scotland, d. 1844 in
      Nelson.<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>Mary's older sister Sally, and brother, <a href=
      "CampbellJohn1781.html">John</a>, came to America before their younger
      siblings. We're not sure exactly when. Sometime between 1800 and 1802
      seems likely for Sam and Sally --- their first child, <a href=
      "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I38">
      Archibald Hazlett</a> was born in Lancaster Co., PA in 1803. John, Mary,
      and <a href="CampbellElizabeth1789.html">Elizabeth</a> may have come
      slightly later. Brother John Campbell married soon after his arrival and
      shortly thereafter moved to what is now Pittsburgh. Mary's son Robert,
      was born in PA in 1809, so we know she was here before then.<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>Mary's parents, and youngest siblings sailed from Londonderry to
      Perth Amboy, NJ in 1810 and went to Sam Hazlett's farm near Stroudsburg
      PA before going to Nelson.<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>John Campbell and wife <a href=
      "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I13">
      Elizabeth Bell</a> moved to a farm near Pittsburgh shortly after they
      married,</big> <big>before his parents came to America. He and Elizabeth
      never came to Nelson. John's oldest sister Sarah/Sally, came to America
      about 1800. John and his older sister, Mary, may not have come until
      1806.</big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>After Mary's death in 1824, her husband and children moved to a farm
      near his brother-in-law, John Campbell, in what is now Pittsburgh's North
      side. Mary Campbell and John Hazlett had ten children, all born in
      Lancaster Co., PA:<br></big>
