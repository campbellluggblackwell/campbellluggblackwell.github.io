          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Cousins on the Pacific Coast I am
          sure your plan for an exchange of family letters is most welcome.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book reached us safely and <a href=
          "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I790">
          Frank</a>, <a href=
          "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I828">
          Arthur</a> and I have read the letters with much pleasure. Already we
          are looking forward to the next installment and the added pleasure of
          having pictures of all. We found on reading the letters that while we
          were fairly well informed, many changes had taken place that we were
          not aware of and to us the letters will mean so much in the way of
          keeping you closer to us.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I found that the most interesting letters
          to me were those containing news of the individual members of the
          different families, I will tell you of our immediate family. Clark
          and I, and our daughter Faith Jean, fifteen years old, comprise our
          family and we live in a very pretty town on the banks of the
          Willamette River, which was used for transportation before the
          general use of the railroads and flivvers.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Portland is seventy miles north of us, with
          wonderfully paved roads in every direction.</font></font></font>

          was graduated from high school last June, as vale­dictorian of her
          class, and this fall entered the University of Oregon for a four year
          course. She is her daddy's own daughter and aspires to become a
          writer.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have unusually good schools in Oregon and
          many of them. Within a two hours' drive of Independence, and not
          including Portland or the University of Oregon, which is at Eugene,
          sixty miles‑from here, we have four denominational schools,‑
          Method­ist, Baptist, Presbyterian and Christian,‑ all prosperous and
          growing; two Catholic schools; the only Normal in the state is two
          miles from us, and the splendid Oregon Agricultural College with
          4,000 students enrolled is twenty miles from here, while in Portland
          there are several private schools and colleges.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have owned and published the Independence
          Enterprise for the past four years and enjoy our work and the friends
          we have made here. I made a desperate attempt to turn Clark into a
          fruit farmer four years ago but found it hopeless,‑ once a newspaper
          man, always a newspaper man, so no doubt we will continue here for
          some time.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur and family live only a few blocks
          from us and we all enjoy being together. He has a nice family and is
          a prosperous hardware merchant. Aside from his own affairs he fills a
          prominent place in our little city, being at present, Presi­dent of
          the Retail Merchants' Association, City Engineer and School
          Director.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frank and wife are visiting us just now,
          having driven down from their home in Portland. He tells me he has
          already written his Cousins' letter.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faith and I visited <a href=

          Harry</a> and family in Baker, Ore. during the summer. He is a busy
          man and interested in all of the city projects for the advancement of
          Baker, where he has practised his profession of dentistry for
          seventeen years.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will close now with kindest regards to the
          Cousins and keen anticipation of the pleasure in store for us on
          receipt of your letters and pictures.<br>
