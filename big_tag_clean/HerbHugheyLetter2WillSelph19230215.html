      Dear Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will</a>,
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Your letter of December 14th with the booklet of snapshots of our
        Cousins was received and I can assure you that it was greatly
        appreciated, despite the fact that I did not make an immediate reply. I
        have studied the faces and I must say that there are four in the third
        group of thirteen that I do not know. They are the two ladies next to
        <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a> standing, the next one
        sitting and the one standing in front of in front of <a href=
        "CongdonCharles1856.html">Charley Congdon</a> and <a href=
        "SeelyJud1851.html">Jud Seely</a>. It is a lamentable fact to think
        that some of our kinsmen have changed so that one does not now know
        them, owing to the separation of so many years. Well, here's hoping
        that we will be able to attend one of the gatherings ere many more
        years pass. When I look at your picture, I can only remember you as a
        baby in your <a href="CampbellJulia1845.html">Mother</a>'s arms when
        she was home from Michigan. Shortly after, she returned there and
        <a href="SelphJennie1873.html">Jennie</a> was born there and I don't
        remember of having seen her after <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Aunt
        Jane Tubbs</a> returned with you both. You see I left Nelson in the
        spring of 1879 and came to Minnesota and have never been back. During
        this time so many changes have transpired. I only have one uncle left
        of all the uncles and aunts. He is over ninety, Father's youngest
        brother living in York State. The majority of the cousins are now
        crowding the three score and ten mark. A few have passed it. While
        young we look into the future longingly, with hopes and aspirations;
        when old, we look back at our past and wonder how time can be so
        fleeting. We get a letter from Charley Congdon once in a while which
        enables us to keep some tab on what transpires back there.

        Late years I have grown careless in regard to keeping up my
        correspondence as I should have done. Since I came West I have had
        quite a strenuous life and have not taken as much recreation as I
        probably have done. I have been engaged in either carpentering or
        farming ever since I came here, but I am beginning to realize the
        necessity of shorter hours, although my general health is good and my
        eyesight is also good. I only use glasses at twilight or evening or if
        filing fine saws. I passed my sixty-fifth birthday the twenty-first of
        last October. Our family consists of two boys and two girls.&nbsp;

        Mary</a>, twenty-three, still at home, but at present is in Dickinson,
        N. C., teaching. She graduated from the State Teachers College at
        Moorhead, Minn. Her qualifications enable her to secure good positions;
        this year she is drawing $145.00 per month.

        As to weather conditions we have had a rather favorable winter here
        until the last two or three weeks; thermometer one morning thirty-six
        degrees below; then the thirteenth and fourteenth of this month they
        claim we had the worst blizzard in twenty-five years. Train service
        stalled for about two days; the worst blockades were between Fargo and
        Jamestown, N. D. The winter seasons here do not appeal to me as they
        used to, but the summers here are ideal. Minnesota is a wonderful state
        for lakes; their shores are bordered by hundreds of summer homes and
        the tourist business is getting to be a big asset for the country; lots
        on some of the more desirable lakes bring high prices.

        Well I must say again that we were glad to hear from you and hope that
        we my meet face to face. Am glad to know that you are established so
        nicely in business; this is the first time we have ever corresponded
        and we hope to hear again from you. By the way did you receive the
        picture of Mother [his wife, Hannah-wbt] which we sent immediately on
        hearing from you; was intending to send letter following picture at the
        time, but the old saying, better late than never, will have to suffice
        for now.
      </p>
      <p>
        With best wishes and complements.
