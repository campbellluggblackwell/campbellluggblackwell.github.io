    Myra</a>, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Harvey Merritt of Farmington, died
    Monday morning, Sept. 7, of typhoid fever, aged about 20 years. The funeral
    services were held at the home in Farmington, Wednesday, September 9, at
    12:30 o'clock, Rev. Mulford, of Tioga officiating.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three weeks previous, at the home and at the same hour
    on which her funeral was appointed, she was united in marriage to Mr.

    Wm. Close</a>, of Farmington, by Rev. Mr. Chamberlain. This fact seemed to
    make the occasion a doubly sad one and the many friends who were present at
    the funeral obsequies extend very deep sympathies to the bereaved husband,
    father and mother.<br>
