      Mrs. Rebecca Lugg</a>, died at her home in Nelson on Saturday, the 16th
      instant, aged 54 years. Mrs. Lugg had been an invalid for some time, but
      her death was a shock to her relatives and friends, who had supposed that
      she was improving. Acute Bright's disease was the immediate cause of her
      death. She leaves four children to mourn her loss---<a href=
