    <div class="Salutation">
      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> Today is April twenty-eighth, nearly two weeks after the time set for
        our Cousins Letters to have been in hand, and we are, therefore, closing
        the book this afternoon, and hope that within another week or ten days
        the bound volume will be ready for mailing to all the cousins. </p>
      <p> I cannot resist the temptation to add just a few words at the close of
        our third volume of the Campbell Cousins Correspondence and to express
        the sincere hope that each of the Cousins will be very much pleased with
        the book. We are to be congratulated on having the hearty cooperation of
        Cousin <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">George Buck</a> in helping us out
        this year. Cousin George is in the book publishing business and the
        suggestions made by him have been most helpful. It is through his
        influence that we are this year able to have a regularly bound book
        which, of course, is the very best way for our combined letters to
        appear.<sup>1</sup> The entire credit for editing and compiling the book
        this year belongs to Cousin George. </p>
      <p> We have delayed sending the sheets to the bindery until the very last
        moment, hoping that each mail might bring in some additional letters
        which could be included in the book. A total of sixty-five letters have
        been accounted for up to date, which exceeds the number of letters last
        year. However, it was our hope and ambition that at least seventy-five
        letters might have appeared in the 1925 volume. By reviewing the list of
        delinquents again this morning we find that twenty-five of the Campbell
        Cousins will not have their letters in this volume. Ten of these cousins
        were kind enough to write letters last year and, of course, we had every
        reason to expect their letters this year. However, sickness or pressure
        of business will oftentimes change plans and we believe that each of the
        delinquent Cousins has a good reason for not writing a letter. </p>
      <p> In the matter of publishing a book of letters which come from so many
        different points in the United States and abroad, each cousin must
        understand that we, who are endeavoring to publish the book, are
        entirely dependent up on the material we receive and the time at which
        we receive it. Our work would be reduced at least fifty percent if we
        could be sure of having letters from all the cousins between April 1st
        and April 15th of each year. Will not all the Cousins please keep this
        thought in mind and help us just as much as possible in this matter? </p>

      <p> Our 1925 volume contains one letter from a third cousin.<sup>2</sup>
        This letter was especially requested, and was received this morning from
        Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I820">Faith
          Jean Kimball</a>, all the way from Eugene, Oregon. Cousin Faith, we
        congratulate you on such a fine letter. As a third cousin you have the
        honor of being the first one to write a letter for the Cousins Book, and
        as a small reward for your prompt response for a letter I have ordered
        one of the books sent to you, direct at your University, and would ask
        that you accept same with my compliments and very best wishes. Next year
        we confidently expect to have a goodly number of other third cousins who
        will contribute a letter for our book, as, for example, Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1014">Dora
          Seely</a> and a number of others whose names might be mentioned. </p>
      <p> Now, cousins, how does the following slogan for 1926 appeal to you?
        "ONE HUNDRED COUSINS' LETTERS FOR 1926". I know where to find the one
        hundred cousins, and if each one of you reading this sentence will just
        help a little bit and do a little boasting throughout the year, we will
        agree to do our part and in 1926 will publish a book containing letters
        from one hundred Campbell Cousins. This will certainly be a big increase
        over our first exchange of letters two years ago which comprised only
        twenty-three letters.</p>
      <p> In closing, we are very glad indeed to note that the Cousins Letters
        are proving to be more and more interesting each year - so much so that
        your officers are encouraged to keep up the good work, believing as we
        do that in the great majority of cases the yearly Cousins Book is highly
        appreciated and treasured. </p>
      <p> Again wishing you health, happiness and prosperity, I am, </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Closing">
      <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
