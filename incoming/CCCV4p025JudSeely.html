        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        It seems so short a time since we wrote our Cousins letters in 1925
        that I hardly know what to write, so many things have happened all
        around us. In our home town there have been a number of deaths and at
        present many are sick.
      </p>
<p>
        Yesterday at the Bulkley farm, above town, a man was crossing the river
        with a load of milk -- the water was high and man and team were
        drowned; the man has not been found yet today; the team and wagon were
        carried nearly a mile down stream.<br/>
</p>
<p>
        I went to Wellsboro a few days ago to see sister <a href="SeelyAda1858.html">Ada Crandall</a>, who is with her son, <span wc_id="I453">
        Mahlon</span>, this winter; she went there last December and has not been
        able to go out on the street since; has been under the doctor's care
        most of the time; gains very slowly.
      </p>
<p>
<span wc_id="I660">
        Mary</span> and I are well as usual and able to eat our rations and this
        reminds me that it is dinner time and I will have to get my own dinner
        for Mary has gone out to a tureen dinner.
      </p>
<p>
        All these things remind me that while we are in life, we are in the
        midst of death. "Be ye also ready, etc."
      </p>
<p>
        With love and best wishes to you all,
      </p>
