    <h1> Sarah LUGG Clinch Blackwell Campbell (1778 - 1867) </h1>
    <p> Sarah was born Jan. 19,&nbsp; 1778 in Bisley, Gloucestershire, Eng., d.
      Jan. 21, 1867 in Nelson, Tioga Co., PA (originally called <a href="BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's
        Island</a>).&nbsp; Sarah's parents were <span wc_id="I31"> Robert Lugg</span>,
      b. Dec. 15, 1750 in Bisley, Gloucestershire, Eng., d. Mar. 27, 1831 in
      Bisley; and <span wc_id="I30"> Ann Ely</span>, b. Aug. 1754 in Bisley.
      Sarah was the oldest of seven children. The sixth, <a href="LuggCharles1791.html">Charles
        Byron Lugg</a>, later emigrated to Nelson.<br>
    </p>
    <p> She was the first "connecting link" tying our Luggs, Clinches,
      Blackwells and Campbells together. And, although there were many
      intermarriages later, she's probably the only one to connect all four
      lines together.<br>
    </p>
    <p> Sarah married:<br>
      1st) March 27, 1803 in England, <span wc_id="I20"> Thomas Clinch</span>,
      b. in England, d. 1805 in NYC of yellow fever;<br>
      2nd) Sept. 9, 1805 in Jersey Shore, PA, <a href="BlackwellEnoch1764ca.html">Enoch
        Blackwell</a>, b. abt 1764 in Avening, Gloucestershire, d. Jun. 3, 1816
      in Jersey Shore, Lycoming Co., PA; and<br>
      3rd) <a href="CampbellJohn1761.html">John Campbell</a>, b. 1761 in
      Scotland, d. 1854, presumably in Nelson.<br>
    </p>
    <p> Thomas Clinch was apparently the second of 8 children of <span wc_id="I28">
        John Clinch</span> and <span wc_id="I29"> Elizabeth (or Sarah) Lucas</span>.<br>
    </p>
    <p> Enoch Blackwell apparently was the second of 10 children of <span wc_id="I2434">
        John Blackwell</span> and <span wc_id="I2435"> Sarah Cole</span>. Enoch
      first married <span wc_id="I27"> Hannah Perrine</span> (sometimes
      reported as Mary Perrin) on Dec. 3, 1783 in Minchinhampton,
      Gloucestershire. She died in England before he emigrated. Enoch and Hannah
      had 6 children, all of whom came to PA. Several of Enoch's siblings also
      came to PA.<br>
    </p>
    <p> Sarah and Thomas Clinch had one child: <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann
        Clinch</a>, b. Jan. 27, 1804, in Gloucestershire, England, m. <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph
        Campbell</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p> Sarah and Enoch Blackwell had two children:<br>
      <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary Blackwell</a>, b. Jun. 8, 1806 in
      Pine Twp., Lycoming Co., PA, m. <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James
        Campbell</a>; and<br>
      <a href="BlackwellEnoch1814.html">Enoch Blackwell</a>, b. June 12, 1814 in
      Jersey Shore, PA; m. 1st) <span wc_id="I2363"> Mary Knapp</span>, 2nd)
      1st cousin <span wc_id="I2360"> Caroline Lugg</span>, 3rd) <span wc_id="I2365">
        Caroline Power</span> Prutsman.<br>
      <br>
      [Mary Knapp's sister, <span wc_id="I642"> Catherine</span>, married <a href="HazlettSamuel1816.html">Samuel
        Hazlett</a>, son of <a href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John</a> and <a href="CampbellJane1792.html">Jane
        Campbell</a> Hazlett. And her brother, <span wc_id="I765"> William</span>,
      married Sam's sister, <span wc_id="I79"> Sally Jane Hazlett</span>.] </p>
    <p> Sarah, Thomas Clinch and baby Ann (and the Blackwell family) sailed from
      Bristol, Apr. 4, 1804 and landed in Philadelphia, May 17, 1804. When Ann
      was a year old, her father died and on Sept. 9, 1805, Sarah married Enoch
      Blackwell. According to Ann's daughter <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Jane
        CAMPBELL</a> Tubbs, Ann was sent to live with Enoch's brother, <span wc_id="I2682">
        Peter Blackwell</span> in New Hope, PA. A Blackwell researcher, the late
      <span wc_id="I2956"> Stella MAUGERI</span> Blackwell, believed it was with
      brother <span wc_id="I2677"> Joshua Blackwell</span>, not Peter. [And I
      agree with Stella.] </p>
    <p> After Enoch Blackwell (the elder) died in 1816, Sarah Lugg married John
      Campbell and moved to Nelson. When Ann reached marrying age, Sarah wrote
      to her suggesting she marry John's nephew, Joseph. He traveled to meet her
      and Ann returned to Nelson with him in late 1821 or early 1822. A week
      after Ann's wedding, Ann's half-sister, Mary Blackwell, married Joseph's
      younger brother, James Campbell. Sarah's son, Enoch Blackwell, was the
      heir of John Campbell. </p>
