<p>
        Dear <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a>:-
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        I'm sure you will forgive my delay in acknowledging your kind letter,
        offering to permit me to be even more closely allied to the Clan
        Campbell than I have been in the past, and the receipt of the book,
        both of which I have greatly enjoyed.
      </p>
<p>
        My <span wc_id="I1574">
        mother</span> has been ill at our house fro nearly a year and passed to
        rest on July 2nd, so that we have had our hands full. She would have
        been 75 in October, a ripe old age, and she was afflicted with a cancer
        of the throat which prevented her taking anything except fluids, we
        were quite ready to see her go and only thankful that she died with but
        little pain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
        I shall be very glad to be included in with the real Campbell Cousins
        if that policy is to be adopted, and will send in a letter when it is
        wanted. My own immediate family is now pretty well wiped out and it is
        fine to be taken in with yours.
      </p>
<p>
        We hope to know you and your family better and would be delighted to
        have you stop whenever you are near. Our <span wc_id="I1579">
        older daughter</span> has been in the <a href="http://www.juilliard.edu/about/brief-history">Damrosch Institute</a>
        for two years but is uncertain as to whether she will return there this
        fall I get down usually two or three times per year to medical
        meetings, etc. and will try to hunt you up if time permits.
      </p>
<p>
        My family unite with me in all kind wishes to you and yours. Thanking
        you again, I remain
      </p>
