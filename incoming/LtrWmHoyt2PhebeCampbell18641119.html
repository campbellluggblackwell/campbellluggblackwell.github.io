        1. The U. S. Sanitary Commission was a precursor of the Red Cross. It
        proved help for sick &amp; injured soldiers, operated hospitals, and
        even gave soldiers stationary for writing this letters home, such as
        this one. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Sanitary_Commission">more</a>.
      </p>
<p>
        2. Wm. Hoyt was in Company H of the 207th Regiment, PA Volunteers. For
        details of this skirmish <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa&amp;cc=moa&amp;sid=778308149b189f58bf191421757c33c6&amp;q1=Two%20Hundred%20and%20Seventh%20Regiment&amp;idno=ABY3439.0005.001&amp;view=image&amp;seq=00000701">

        3. Apparently he was by then assigned as an orderly at the field
        hospital.
      </p>
<p>
        4. The war was going well for the Union, with Sheridan having captured
        the Shenandoah Valle, the Confederacy's granary, and Sherman's
        victories in GA. But Pvt. Hoyt's regiment was still bogged down at the
        siege of Petersburg, VA, so he probably was expecting a leave, rather
        that the war ending soon. Not much fighting happened in winter. See
        <a href="http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/warfare-and-logistics/warfare/winter/winter-encampments-1.html">

<p>
        5. There were many in the regiment who were named 'John' and came from
        the Nelson/Farmington area. But of those in Company H, the most likely
        is his brother-in-law, <a href="CampbellJohn1836.html">John H.
        Campbell</a>.
      </p>
<p>
        6. Perhaps his mother, <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann CLINCH</a>
        Campbell.
