      <p><b>THE REUNIONS.</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Township,_Tioga_County,_Pennsylvania">Nelson,
          PA</a>'s Campbell Reunions ran from 1893 to 1942, and were open to the
        public, but were for the descendants of <a href="CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph</a>
        &amp; <a href="HarperMary1749.html">Mary Harper</a> Campbell,
        associated Lugg and Blackwell families, and friends. Attendance was
        sometimes several hundred. They resumed in 2001.</p>
      <p><b>THE DINNERS.</b> The Cousins Dinners started in 1909 and ran at
        least until 1923. Joseph and Mary Harper Campbell had eight children.
        But the dinners were only for the grandchildren of one of their
        children, <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph Campbell</a>, and
        his wife, <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann Clinch</a> Campbell. They
        were by invitation only and were primarily for the 35 grandchildren of
        Joseph and Ann Clinch Campbell, the grandchildren's spouses and whomever
        a particular dinner's hostess chose to invite. Those 35 first cousins
        all were born in, or near, Nelson and had contact with each other before
        dispersing around the country. Attendance at the dinners seldom was more
        than 50. They often used the term <i>own cousins</i> to refer to
        themselves rather than its synonym, <i>first cousins</i>. The dinners
        started because those "own cousins" felt a bond and wanted to keep in
        touch -- and because they wanted a more intimate gathering than the
        hundreds that attended Campbell Reunions in the early 1900s.</p>
