            <h4>"Carpe diem.” </h4>
            <p>That Latin phrase is usually translated, all too literally, as
              "Seize the day." But the original spirit of the saying may be more
              like "Seize the moment" or even "strike while the iron is hot."</p>
            <p>My career path was not a series of carefully planned steps. Nor a
              "random walk." It was more a matter of preparing myself for the
              next step when it presented itself and being flexible enough to
              take advantage of opportunity when it knocked.</p>
            <p>Looking back, I'm surprised at how industrious I was, even as a
              little kid. Like many of you, I started out with a lemonade stand.
              Then on to door to door selling to neighbors chances on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punchboard">punchboards</a>
              - not knowing they were illegal. Then the usual boyhood odd jobs
              -- mowing lawns, shoveling snow, raking leaves, helping on a paper
              route, etc. I also remember selling magazine subscriptions door to
              door. My high school and college years saw me in a wide variety of
              part time and summer jobs: paper boy; newspaper truck boy
              delivering bundles to stores and route carriers; summer camp
              counselor; retail sales in a liquor store; ditch digger; making
              awnings, tents, beach umbrellas and custom covers for boats --
              even being director of a summer camp. There was no strategy to
              those jobs other than earning income for pocket money or for the
              next semester's books and expenses.</p>
            <h4>After high school: First "Real Jobs.”</h4>
            <p>My first job with a weekly paycheck almost killed me. The job was
              with the circulation department of a daily newspaper as a "truck
              boy.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#TruckBoy"></a> </p>
            <p>Ditch digging and tent making were my most interesting, enjoyable
              -- and instructive of my summer jobs. I enjoyed the former<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
                href="#Laborer"></a>, because my mind was free to wander and
              contemplate and it was body building.</p>
            <p>My summer job as a cutter<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#Cutter"></a>
              at the tent and awning company taught me a lot. I was raised by a
              Victorian mother and grandmother who had aspirations of gentility.
              My workstation was next to a production line of sewing machines,
              operated by middle aged women. I was amazed at how much they swore
              and how bawdily they talked. It was a game to them to see if they
              could make me blush. Very educational sociologically - and
              sometimes in other areas.</p>
            <p>I was an utter failure at one summer job, going door to door
              selling encyclopedias. My trainer was one of their top sales
              persons and tried to help me with the scripts, but my heart wasn't
              in it. It seemed to me that their script was highly manipulative
              and the the company targeted low income people who couldn't afford
              the expensive subscription and played on their guilt. Perhaps that
              wasn't my judgement call to make, but I quit that job after just a
              few days.</p>
            <p>One job that I worked at off and on for several years and enjoyed
              was doing market research surveys. And surveys for a political
              science research project.</p>
            <p>Very different was a job my friend Renny Boezi and I had for two
              holiday seasons at a privately owned wine and liquor store. It
              seemed tragic when panhandlers came in with a handful of nickles
              and dimes to buy our cheapest bottle of muscatel. I didn't like
              facilitating their addiction, but the law required selling to them
              if they were sober. I hadn't suspected I had a knack for retail
              sales, but had more knowledge of liqueurs and wines than I'd
              realized. The owner was pleased that I could "Sell up." "If you're
              looking for a gift, we have some nice bottles of ..." Or, "If you
              like __ then you might enjoy trying __."</p>
            <p>He could have lost his liquor license for having an open bottle
              on the premises, but in his office, one desk drawer contained some
              "Christmas cheer" and by Christmas eve closing time, he would be
              in a very jolly, expansive mood. He would tell us "As a present,
              you can have a bottle of whatever you want." Which we did.</p>
            <p> Those were the most memorable jobs of my student days. </p>
            <h4>After college: Earning a living</h4>
            <p> As I mentioned in a previous chapter, after finishing my
              undergraduate work in 1958, I found myself in the middle of a
              recession. Jobs were scarce, jobs that paid enough to live on,
              even in just an unfurnished room, were even scarcer. I had a good
              general education, but little specific training or job experience.
              So I tried my hand at substitute teaching. I did well at teaching
              9th grade social studies for a three day gig. And then took an
              assignment filling in for a high school math teacher who caught
              measles from a student. That ended sooner than expected when I
              caught mumps from a class. I was sick as a dog and after
              recovering, decided substitute teaching wasn't the solution.</p>
            <p>Previously I mentioned that at the end of my summer job as a
              laborer, the personnel guy that had hired that bunch of summer
              students called us together at the end of our working there and
              gave us a "If you're ever looking for a job, please keep us in
              mind" pep talk. So now, I took him up on it an applied there for a
              job. Preferably one that didn't require climbing roofs during
              thunderstorms. After studying my application he said, "You've had
              a lot of math. If you had a course in statistics, I think we could
              hire you." Not having a better prospect I signed up that fall for
              a course at Harpur in statistics -- and looked for part time jobs.
              One day I was in the administration building, heading up to the
              placement office again, when just before I disappeared from sight,
              an acquaintance caught a glimpse as I was disappearing and called
              out, "Hey, Bill." I turned around and descended the stairs to see
              why he hailed me. He explained, "I saw an ad for a place near
              here, they are looking for people to work on their loading dock.
              I'm on my way there now, would you like a ride?" It sounded better
              than no job. We filled out applications and were interviewed on
              the spot. And we both were offered jobs. But the guy who
              interviewed me, said "I see you've had a lot of math. We have an
              opening in our engineering department for someone to make
              calculations. It pays $.35/hr. more than the loading dock job, are
              you interested." That was one of the easiest decisions I've ever
              made! I could walk from class to work and vice versa. I didn't
              have a car, but there was a guy in the engineering dept. who lived
              near me and I could ride with for a few bucks a week.</p>
            <p> <img src="MarchantFigurematic.png" alt="Photo of Marchant Figurematic, the
                leading electromechanical scientific calculator" style="width:20%; float:right;">At
              the time, computers cost millions of dollars and took up a whole
              floor of a building and electronic calculators hadn't been
              invented, so engineers used slide rules, paper and pencils, or
              electro-mechanical calculators to solve equations. I was hired as
              a "statistical clerk"<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#StatisticalClerk"></a>
              and given a desk with 1959's state of the art equipment, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchant_Calculating_Machine_Company">Marchant
                Figurematic.</a> </p>
            <h4>A full-time job: Starting as a department manager!</h4>
            <p>Apparently he liked my work and my work ethic. My manager, the
              chief engineer, called me into his office toward the end of the
              fall semester and asked if I was planning to take any courses the
              next semester. Hearing that I wasn't, he said, "Good, we're going
              to start a data processing department, we'd like to hire you
              full-time to set it up and manage it."<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
                href="#DPManager"></a> </p>
            <p>It was a family owned company. I'd be working for his wife, the
              company's treasurer, who was the daughter of its president and
              principle owner. The new found prosperity as "Data Processing
              Manager" (even though as yet I had no employees to manage) allowed
              me to marry Barbara. She was a newly graduated art teacher, who
              found a job teaching at a junior high school a couple of blocks
              from my employment and we found a tiny apartment a block away. We
              didn't even need a car. My professional career was launched.</p>
            <p><img src="ApertureCard.png" alt="Photo of a punched card containing a microfilm image"
                style="width:20%; float:right;">We implemented and ran all the
              usual accounting applications, such as Accounts Payable, Accounts
              Receivable, General Ledger, etc. (Payroll continued to be done by
              an outside service.) But the data centers main function was
              information retrieval. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture_card">Aperture
                cards</a> were the key.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#ApertureCards"></a></p>
            <p>After a couple of years there, I learned that I was going to be a
              father, which prompted reviewing my situation. My tiny department
              was was running fine, all the intended applications were up and
              running and the equipment was running at capacity -- no new
              development was on the horizon. It was a family run company, there
              was no advancement path for those who were not member of the
              family. It was time to move on. </p>
            <p>Remembering the fellow who'd told me he'd hire me if I took a
              course in statistics (which I hadn't used yet). I reapplied to
              General Aniline and Film Corp.'s Photographic Division<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
                href="#AgfaAnsco"></a> in Binghamton (the company I had cheerily
              dug ditches for) and and was interviewed. They were looking for an
              "<a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/operations-analyst/">operations
                analyst</a>" to solve problems using a fairly new mathematical
              technique, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/linear-programming-mathematics">linear
                programing</a>. I told them I didn't know anything about it, and
              was told, "Don't worry about it, you'll learn." I was hired with a
              nice raise. Which was welcome, with a child on the way and my wife
              had resigned her job. After receiving my letter of acceptance with
              a start date 30 days ahead, I turned in my letter of resignation
              to my employer, confident they would appreciate having a full
              month's notice.</p>
            <h4>A bump in the road: The best laid plans ...</h4>
            <p>To my surprise, when I turned in my letter of resignation, the
              response was, "You're fired. Pack up your things and get out!" My
              pride was hurt, but I wasn't worried, my new job would start
              shortly. Except that when I got home, a letter from GAF was
              waiting, which said, "Don't resign yet. A temporary hiring freeze
              has been ordered. We expect to receive an OK for you to start
              early next year." Up the creek w/o a paddle. No job and a baby due
              soon. And a man was supposed to be "a good provider."</p>
            <p>I didn't have the courage to tell my wife that I'd been fired.
              For several days I dressed up each morning and left the apartment
              at the usual time and killed time till it was time to return. I
              did that for several days before confessing our plight. </p>
            <h4>Temp to the Rescue</h4>
            <p> Needing a job, I answered an ad from a temp agency. They "rented
              me out" to IBM's Federal Systems Division in Owego, NY -- as a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_writer">technical
                writer</a>. (In spite of the fact that I had no experience as a
              technical writer.) That division did work for NASA on the Mercury,
              Gemini and Apollo missions and built custom, on-board computers
              for the capsules. I was given some manuals that I was to make some
              revisions to, and told to familiarize myself with the manuals'
              organization and writing style. But, before receiving any actual
              assignment, I was transferred to a different job. <img src="IBM650.png"
                alt="Photo of the IBM 650, a mainframe of the 1950s" style="width:20%; float:right;">Their
              data center called my temp agency requesting someone, ASAP, to
              work in their data center. My employer told them you've already
              got someone on board, who is experienced, use him. That's how I
              was introduced to the world of computers and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_650">IBM
                650</a>,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#IBM650"></a>
              the world's first mass produced computer. And the end of my
              extremely brief career as a technical writer.</p>
            <h4>My Land of Opportunity</h4>
            <p>Eventually GAF came through and I, like "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punxsutawney_Phil">Punxsutawney
                Phil,</a>" I came into my own in February.</p>
            <p>I started in the photographic engineering department in a small
              group that primarily dealt with statistical analysis of the
              manufacturing plant's data, but also the divisions R&amp;D data as
              well. I read up on linear programming, but before getting my first
              problem to solve, my job changed. The manager who hired me died.
              (I'd only gotten to speak with him once since starting the job.)
              The department was reorganized and the statistical section was
              spun off as a new department. While I was with GAF I went through
              countless reorganizations and job titles. If you haven't heard the
              classic joke, "Three Envelopes," read it in this footnote.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
                href="#ThreeEnvelopes"></a></p>
            <h4>Marvelous Mentors</h4>
            <p>I had the good fortune to have had my career shaped by two
              extraordinary mentors: <a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/pressconnects/name/stanley-rogge-obituary?id=28629467">Stan
                Rogge</a><a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#StanRogge"></a>
              and <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/178527982/calvin-herbert-besore">Cal
                Besore</a><a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#CalBesore"></a>
              (both now deceased). I doubt that anyone ever had better
              managerial role models than Stan and Cal provided. I worked with
              and for them at two different companies. Out of deference to
              readers who may not be interested in such things, I'll discuss
              them in footnotes, but don't want to in any way diminish how much
              I admire then, appreciate their friendship, their patience and
              wisdom, and gratitude for all I learned from them. And their names
              will come up as I discuss my time with them at both companies.</p>
            <p> As I mentioned, my first manager at GAF, the one who hired me,
              died soon after I started and the department was reorganized. Our
              section was christened "Plant Statistics,"my office mate Stan got
              an office of his own, and we moved from an administration building
              to one of the film manufacturing plants. We were no longer part of
              Engineering, Stan reported to the manager of manufacturing
              photographic film and paper. By virtue of the reorganization, my
              job title changed to "Plant Statistician" -- even though I had not
              yet done any statistics for them, and didn't for some time. </p>
            <div class="w3-container w3-serif"> The department was replacing one
              of the first personal computers (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_610">IBM
                610</a>), and had ordered one IBM's first inexpensive scientific
              computer, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1620">IBM
                1620</a>. I was to continue doing mathematical work, but also be
              "in charge of" the 1620.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#1620"></a>

              <p> They got it so that the company's engineers and scientists
                could have access to the computer. They could sign up for 1 hour
                time slots to use the computer. I would not only maintain the
                sign-up sheets, but also to teach them programming and help them
                as needed. (Of course I had never programmed a computer, but a
                bunch of courses at IBM's Education Center soon fixed that.) [<i>See
                  any pattern?</i>]</p>
              <p> I remember an engineer in one of the programming courses I
                taught asking, in all seriousness, "How do I know the machine
                was plugged in when it gave me this answer? And how do I know
                it's not deliberately lying to me?" (I hope I answered
                diplomatically.) BTW, battery technology was not advanced back
                then and computers consumed a lot of electricity.</p>
              <p> I had lots of job title changes, some relating to Quality
                Control, some statistics,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#Statistica"></a>
                some to computing, but that phase of my career culminated with
                my being "Manager of Scientific Computing," with a talented
                staff.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#ScienticComputing"></a></p>
              <p>My interest in information retrieval, whetted by my venture
                with retrieving transformer designs, didn't disappear when I
                changed employers. I'd written a program to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Word_in_Context#:%7E:text=A%20KWIC%20index%20is%20formed,full%20text%20search%20became%20common.">KWIC
                  indexing</a> for our R&amp;D department in the Photographic
                Division that I thought would be useful to other companies.
                Nothing about it was proprietary, so I donated the program to
                the 1620 Users Group and gave a brief talk on it at the next
                meeting of the 1620 Users Group at their next annual meeting,
                which was in Montreal. The paper, which was published in their
                proceedings, was my one and only publication in which I was the
                sole author. Not much claim to fame in the academic world.</p>
              <p>As mentioned in the chapter on education, I decided to get a
                masters degree in Information Science. I'd been doing a lot of
                work for a crystallographer who worked at the Central Research
                Lab of GAF's Chemical and Dyestuffs Division, in Easton, PA.
                Easton was next to Bethlehem, PA where Lehigh U. was located.
                Lehigh had a masters program offered by their interdisciplinary
                Center for Information Science (which happened to be under the
                aegis of the Philosophy Department). The GAF lab in Easton had a
                PhD chemist who also was a patent attorney, Dr. Albert C.
                Starke, in charge of their library, who was active in chemical
                documentation. I was accepted at Lehigh and we worked out a deal
                whereby I would take a leave of absence from GAF Binghamton,
                transfer to GAF Easton, work half-time for Dr. Starke, at half
                pay, but with all benefit rights preserved. I spent two
                fascinating years there, working on their GADSAR project.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
                  href="#GADSAR"></a></p>
              <p>My half time work schedule and limited finances only allowed
                taking two courses per semester, so I hadn't quite finished when
                Cal called after two years. They had a new project, using a
                process control computer to operate an automated warehouse,
                completely in the dark, to store master rolls of photographic
                film and needed a body for that project. He couldn't hold my
                position open any longer, it was return or be replaced. I was
                tempted to stay, officially be hired by that division and
                complete my degree. Al would have hired me full time, but there
                was a problem. The lab was being moved to Woodbridge, NJ, an
                hour further from Lehigh.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#Woodbridge"></a>
              </p>
              <h4>"You can't go home again."</h4>
              <p> <img src="IBM360M40.png" alt="Photo of the IBM 360 Model 40 computer"
                  style="width:35%; float:right;">GAF Binghamton retrieved me,
                not only because of their ambitious, pioneering, automated
                warehouse project, but also because they were replacing the
                faithful old 1620 computer with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360_Model_40">IBM
                  360 Model 40</a> and conversion work had to be done.</p>
              <p>Lots of overtime was required, but we pulled it off. The new
                computer was vastly more powerful. Signing up for an hour of
                having the computer to yourself had been a thing of the past
                long before I transferred to PA. Now we had timesharing (I did
                some systems programming and modified an IBM internal project to
                work for us). Now we had terminals throughout the plant and
                R&amp;D labs. And the capacity to give timely support to
                manufacturing operations. We still provided support to engineers
                and scientists all over the country, if requested. And still at
                no charge. More and more, the programs were purchased from
                software vendors, or written by our staff for "internal
                customers." I taught our programmers how to write more versatile
                programs, that could easily be maintained, expanded or
                generalized. And taught in-house courses on programming,
                statistics and on design of experiments.</p>
              <p>Stan, who had risen to be general manager of our division, left
                to be VP of manufacturing at an apparel company in NC and Cal
                soon followed.&nbsp; One of my colleagues from our Plant
                Statistics day, an industrial engineer, was selected as Cal's
                replacement. He was a decent guy and competent, but seemed to me
                uninspired and uninspiring, the fun was gone, and now it was
                just a job.</p>
              <p>Corporate HQ took control of all the corporation's computers. I
                found myself in a new organization, reporting to someone in NYC,
                whom I never got to meet before they reorganized again. I then
                found myself in a Binghamton branch of a Corporate Systems
                Engineering Department, with most of my old programmers working
                for me and some new faces the new management had hired. And no
                longer supporting other locations. My new manager was on site, a
                photographic engineer from our early days in Plant Statistics,
                but quite rigid. I held weekly symposia where one of the staff
                would present an idea or technique that he or she had developed
                or discovered which they thought would be useful for the others
                to know. And the 'she' part brings me to the story of my
                insubordination to my new manager, which I somehow survived. We
                needed another programmer and he gave me the OK to hire one, but
                advised me "Don't bother to interview any women." That was a
                violation of state law, so I interviewed whoever Personnel sent.
                By far the best candidate was a woman who worked at IBM, but
                felt she didn't get the recognition she deserved. And took a pay
                cut to take the job. One of the best hire I ever made. Very
                professional, very experienced, and very bright. Perhaps the
                only reason I survived defying him was that he couldn't admit to
                Personnel or upper management that he'd asked me to disobey the
                law. Perhaps he would have found a way to retaliate, but they
                reorganized again before that could happen. In one of the
                reorganizations, I found myself sidelined. Given a fancy title
                -- Director of Systems Development. With the responsibility of
                monitoring trends in computer applications and advising the
                corporation about how to keep up or to take advantage of new
                trends in the computer world. In actuality, the job consisted of
                going to computer expos and writing "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper">white
                  papers</a>" that no one was interested in reading. Clearly low
                hanging fruit for any future "reduction in force." My pension
                wasn't fully vested yet, so I took advantage of years of
                assistance to R&amp;D and was able to transfer to their Process
                Engineering Department. Usually process engineers have a lot of
                experience as chemical engineers. I had been a software
                engineer, a quality engineer and a systems engineer, but had
                never studied chemistry just picked up bits and pieces along the
                way as needed. But they thought my knowledge of statistics,
                math, and computers would be useful. My work for them did
                provide my boss with material for a paper, in which he took full
                credit for what I had done. But I survived long enough to get
                vested rights to my pension. My gripe with him soon ended when
                our whole division was closed and about 2,000 of us were laid
                off.</p>
              <h4>The Big World of Minicomputers</h4>
              <p> I took a job with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">Digital
                  Equipment Corporation</a> in sales support as a Senior
                Software Specialist, even though I had as yet, no experience
                with DEC's hardware or software. DEC was a great success story.
                They had come from being a start up by some MIT folks to
                becoming the second biggest computer company in the world. They
                had great products, a large base of happy customers, good
                management and good engineering. They seemed to be within reach
                of bypassing IBM. Few expected that they were approaching their
                <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/zenith">zenith</a>.<a
                  aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#DEC"></a></p>
              <p>I worked three years for DEC, detailed in the footnote above.
                As that assignment was drawing to an end, my manager informed me
                that the number of people doing such work was being reduced, my
                present position would be eliminated but DEC had two positions
                open that were available to me: one a rather boring sounding job
                in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlborough,_Massachusetts">Marlborough,
                  MA</a> - a nice enough town, but a higher cost of living and
                at the same salary. The other job is one I would have given a
                eye tooth for a couple of year previously, but the timing was
                bad. This job was in Maynard, MA, at DEC's HQ. A charming town
                in Emerson and Thoreau country.&nbsp; A much higher cost of
                living, but at a salary that more than made up for it. DEC
                wanted to develop a new database management system and offered
                me the chance to be in charge of that project. Half of my time
                was to be spent at DEC HQ, interfacing with the folks in charge
                of the various operating systems that would need to be
                interfaced to the new data base and with marketing folks and
                applications groups. The other half would be spent with the
                development team I would be directing, who were located in N.
                Ireland. A couple of years earlier I would have jumped at that
                chance, but now it had some downsides. I don't know which I
                would have chosen if I had not gotten a cal from Cal, inviting
                me to join him and Stan in NC. I went there for an interview
                with my boss to be, the VP of Finance, got an offer, brought the
                family down for a quick look see -- they approved and I
                accepted. </p>
              <h4>The Real Mayberry</h4>
              <figure><img src="PilotMt.png" alt="Photo Pilot Mt., NC" style="width:25%; float:right;"><figcaption>Pilot
                  Mt.</figcaption></figure>
              <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Airy,_North_Carolina">Mt.
                  Airy, NC</a> is in a beautiful location. At the base of the
                Blue Ridge, 5 miles south of the Virginia sate line, on the
                usually placid Ararat River, and is Andy Griffiths' home town.
                We bought a beautiful, vintage 1900 home there, for a song.
                Wraparound porch with a portico, 12 foot ceilings, 5 fireplaces,
                a library with built in bookcases (all of 3/4" knotty pine as
                was the paneling, and surrounded by majestic, giant, old trees.
                But a culture shock. Life was slower paced. And one's job seemed
                to be less a priority than in NY, PA &amp; NH. And project
                deadlines were less of a priority than in those 3 NE states. </p>
              <p>In the late 1970s, women seemed to have less status than in the
                other places I'd lived. I remember one afternoon meeting of the
                company's top managers, when the manager of our largest sewing
                plant stood up and said, "It's almost 5 o'clock. I have to leave
                now because my husband expects hot biscuits on the table when he
                gets home."<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#MtAiry"></a></p>
              <p>[See the above footnote for details of my time there.] The
                city's economy never recovered from that flood. I was sure that
                my company would not be successful in its recovery efforts and
                started looking for jobs in Winston-Salem or Greensboro. Out of
                the blue, I got a call from my friend, the former production
                control manager, wanting me to come work for his employer, in <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakertown,_Pennsylvania">Quakertown,
                  PA</a>., which is only 15 miles from Bethlehem.</p>
              <p>His timing was great. Greensboro and Winston-Salem were both
                farther than I really wanted to commute on a daily basis. He put
                the icing on the cake when he said "Christmas activities are in
                full swing in Bethlehem. [It calls itself "The Christmas City.]
                Come for an interview and bring your family for a mini-vacation.
                If you don't want the job you'll at least have a good time." We
                did have a good time and I did accept the job offer. (I sadly
                said goodbye to Cal, but got to visit him and Dot several times
                before they died.) </p>
              <h4>Return to the Lehigh Valley</h4>
              <p> So, in 1980, I returned to the Lehigh Valley and have remained
                here ever since. I had liked the area when I lived here in the
                late 1960s. And and after one winter in Glens Falls, where we
                had a week where the high for the week was zero and every night
                sank below -30; and 3 years in NC where for 6 months of the year
                it was too hot to enjoy outdoor activities such as playing
                tennis or going for bike rides and so humid that my books
                mildewed, the Lehigh Valley seemed like a good compromise.</p>
              <p>The job I was offered was working for an apparel company, this
                one a subsidiary of a major apparel company. My new company had
                been getting their data processing services from the parent
                company, but were not satisfied with the service, support, nor
                price they were charged. So they decided to form their own IT
                Department, get an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/38">IBM
                  S/38</a> computer, and hire someone like me to make it a
                reality.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#Quakertown"></a></p>
              <p> We did get a lot of applications up and running -- sometimes
                by buying software packages and sometimes by writing the
                programs themselves. Admittedly we were running behind the
                original schedule and under pressure. Our contract programmer
                sometimes dealt with that pressure by doing yoga exercises on
                his lunch hour. One day, one of the executives came in from
                lunch and, as I remember it, demanded that I fire the contract
                programmer because he was doing headstands, a yoga exercise. As
                I understand it, is supposed to improve the flow of blood to the
                brain. My recollection is that the executive demanded that I
                fire him immediately because I shouldn't let crazy people near
                our software. My attempts to explain that it was a long
                established exercise seemed in vain. Finally, I reminded him
                that I didn't work for him or&nbsp; take orders from him. I
                sensed I'd made a bitter enemy.&nbsp; A few months later, for
                reasons I don't know the details of, there was a meeting of the
                board. The president and the VP I worked for were out, and the
                new president was the guy I'd been undiplomatic with. I
                concluded I had no future there, resigned and went into business
                for myself.</p>
              <h4>"Tis a small thing, but mine own." </h4>
              <p> After decades of working for Fortune 500 companies, and being
                frustrated by their follies, the idea of striking out on my own
                sounded risky, but good. Aside from operating a lemonade stand
                (with my mother's guidance) my small business experience was
                pretty limited. I knew I didn't have the savings or financial
                backers(s) usually needed to launch a small business, but
                figured if I started small enough I could make it work. If
                you'll excuse a mixed metaphor -- pulling my self up by a
                shoestring. :)</p>
              <p>But I was used to venturing on untrod ground, and hooked up
                with the Small Business Administration's Small Business
                Development Center at Lehigh U., read their brochures, got
                paired up with a coach from <a href="https://www.score.org/">SCORE</a>,
                formed a business plan, and forged ahead. "Nothing ventured,
                noting gained." I didn't have much capital to risk, so I
                initially relied on contract programming for income. I joined
                "Apple Computer Experts" (Apple recommended independent
                consultants) and also the Independent Computer Consultants
                Organization. (Both now defunct.) Sometimes I worked with
                partners, sometimes by myself, sometimes with as many as 5
                subcontractors working for me.</p>
              <p> Some lean years and some quite prosperous years. I did all
                sorts of stuff -- much more than you want to waste time hearing
                the details of. Some was high powered and fascinating; some very
                mundane. I worked in many different industries and for
                organizations of all types and sizes for two decades. I never
                formally retired. I just tapered off until finally the ride was
                over and I was ready to relax and focus on this website.

              <p>I may have portrayed myself as a "jack of all trades and master

              </ul>

            <li id="TruckBoy">
              <p> (Truck boy) They had panel trucks, with no rear doors, just an
                opening. With a vertical pole on each side of where the rear
                doors would have been. And a low step as a kind of a running
                board across the rear of the truck. Each driver had a route,
                which includes news stands, mom &amp; pop grocery stores, and
                the carriers ("paper boys") that delivered the papers to
                subscribers homes. Papers came off the huge, fast moving
                printing presses, were automatically cut, folded and came up
                conveyor belts, where they were automatically counted and baled
                with a sheet identifying which store or carrier they were
                destined for and how many papers were in each bundle. They came
                off the conveyor belt in the reverse order of how they were to
                be delivered so that those to be delivered last were stowed in
                the cargo space, with those to be delivered last stowed furthest
                from the non-existent back doors of the truck. The deliveries
                were made during the evening rush hour and drivers didn't like
                to stop if they could avoid it.</p>
              <p> We had to wear work gloves with leather palms and fingers so
                that the bailing wire didn't cut our hands. As we'd come up to
                each delivery spot, the truck boy would grab the appropriate
                bundle to be delivered with one hand and a vertical grab pole
                with the other, the driver would slow and the truck boy would
                sling the bundle to land on the sidewalk at roughly the target
                spot. But for a grocery or news stand, the bundles had to be
                carried inside. The driver would slow down, the truck boy would
                grab the customer's bundles (there were usually two) -- and step
                backward off the rear running board -- landing running. The
                momentum from the moving truck would pitch you forward, so you
                had to land running to avoid a face plant.</p>
              <p>One time I misjudged. I hopped off when the truck was moving
                too fast. Fortunately I only has one bundle (which I managed to
                throw back into the truck. While my other hand hanged
                desperately onto the grab pole. I was dragged along, one calf
                and foot against the pavement. The driver was oblivious to my
                predicament. I was hoping that he would stop soon, but when he
                slowed down, that was terrifying. I was hanging onto the pole on
                the truck's left side. My body's momentum would slowly swing out
                into the other lane and my foot would approach the front of the
                tire, threatening to run over my foot. But moving fast enough so
                that I didn't dare let go and slide to who knows where. After
                what seemed like and eternity, the driver saw me in his rear
                view mirror and slowed to a gentle stop. I escaped with only
                minor brush burns. But relived it in nightmares long after.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="Laborer">
              <p> (Laborer job) My introduction to unions was informative. I'm
                supportive of unions in general. They've done great things for
                our country -- child labor laws; the five day week and eight
                hour day; overtime pay; occupational safety laws; disability
                insurance; and prosperity for starters. But my introduction to
                them was negative. Summer job holders didn't have to join the
                union. But at that company, permanent employees had to either
                join the union or pay dues to it, an arrangement known as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_shop">agency
                  shop</a>." That arrangement seems fair to me, but the shop
                stewards have a great deal of power, and I got on the wrong sign
                of mine. </p>
              <p>I was raise to believe in earning your pay and if erring on
                that, to err on the side of giving extra effort. Which quickly
                led to warnings from the steward that I was making the others
                "look bad" by working too hard. I was stubborn and not easily
                browbeaten, so I persisted in doing what I believed was right.
                Which lead to a series of job changes intended to "teach me a
                lesson." My job title was "laborer." He couldn't change that, or
                my pay, but he could change my assignments. Initially I was
                pushing wheelbarrows of wet, mixed concrete to pour into wooden
                forms. To punish me, he had me changed to digging ditches, ten
                hours per day. As mentioned above, I loved that, but continued
                to work harder than he wanted. So next I was assigned to
                shoveling out storm sewers, a rather stinky job. And messy. But
                I took that in stride (and still worked too hard), so I had the
                additional -- and somewhat dangerous assignment of checking roof
                drains when it rained. There was access to the roofs from inside
                the building, but I was ordered to climb up and down outside
                steel ladders, which could get slippery in the rain. The factory
                buildings were several stories high and had flat roofs. The
                drains could occasionally get clogged with debris and did need
                checking. But being on top of 5 or 6 story buildings in the
                middle of a thunderstorm can be disquieting. But he did his
                worst and I "weathered it" so to speak. Without learning any
                lesson except that there was sometimes a price to pay for doing
                what you feel is right.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="Cutter">
              <p> (Cutter) I had no experience in factory work of any kind -- so
                the sewing machine operators were memorable -- and none as a
                cutter.</p>
              <p>The fabric came in long rolls of wide cloth in all weights,
                from thin, very light fabrics for lining beach umbrellas to
                heavy canvas soaked in copper solutions to make it resistant to
                tropical fungi. The cutters basic job was to take a work order,
                go into the stock room and fetch a roll of the specified fabric,
                bring it on a dolly to the cutting table and mount it on frame
                that ran on tracks.&nbsp; Then move the roll back and forth over
                the cutting table depositing layers of cloth. (The more skilled
                the cutter the more "lays" of fabric they could successfully cut
                at a time.)</p>
              <figure><img src="FabricSpreadingMachine.png" alt="Photo of a 'spreading machine' used to deposit folds of cloth on a cutting table."
                  style="width: 30%;; float: right;"><figcaption>Fabric
                  spreading machine. It ran on tracks on top of the cutting
                  table. The skewer on top was inserted into the hollow core of
                  the roll of fabric and an end of the roll threaded through the
                  machines guides. The device was rolled back and forth over the
                  length of the cutting table, each time depositing a 'fold' or
                  layer of cloth.</figcaption></figure>
              <p> The work order carried a pattern number. So you retrieved the
                pattern, usually a many foot long piece of cardboard,
                press-board or plastic, that you laid on top of the fabric. A
                pattern had long slots which tailors' chalk fit into so that you
                could mark the fabric. Then you used an electric knife. </p>
              <figure><img src="ElectricCuttingKnife.png" alt="Photo of an electic fabric cuttine 'knife' used to cutt folds of cloth on a cutting table."
                  style="width: 20%;; float: leftt;"><figcaption>Fabric cutting
                  knife. It had a fast moving, sharp, reciprocal blade and could
                  easily remove a finger. As you turned corners to follow the
                  pattern drawn on the top layer of fabric, it tended to 'lean'
                  and cut at a slant, causing the top layer of fabric to cut a
                  much wider (or narrower) piece than at the bottom layer. You
                  had to slow down and turn corners carefully. And layers of
                  thin, slippery material tended to shift.</figcaption></figure>
              <p>The stacked layers of cut cloth were carefully removed from the
                table and placed in containers of the appropriate size and given
                to the sewing machine "foreman," along with the work order. The
                leftover scraps of cut cloth were disposed of, the remainder of
                the roll returned to the stock room, and you were ready for the
                next work order.</p>
              <p>Fortunately I wasn't the only cutter.<img src="BlanchardDrawTightTent.png"
                  alt="Photo of the popular 'Blanchard DrawTight Tent'." style="width: 40%;; float: right;">
                There was an experienced guy who could advise me when I needed
                assistance. My boss was the talented, patient and forgiving
                Dennis Blanchard, inventor of the popular "Blanchard Draw Tight
                Tent." After a few beginners errors I developed an aptitude for
                the work and was given more and more responsibility. One of the
                company's products was custom made covers for boats of all
                sizes, even cabin cruisers. Before the summer was over, I was
                trusted to measure a customer's boat, make patterns for its
                cover(s) and cut it for the sewers. I think the experienced
                cutter was jealous of my getting those assignments. One thing
                they turned me down on however, was investigating a customer
                complaint. We made a valence for the top of the platform for a
                carnival "girly show." I volunteered to visit the carnival,
                watch the show, and see if the valance presented any problems,
                but they turned down my offer.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="StatisticalClerk">(Statistical Clerk) In spite of the job
              title, no knowledge of statistics was involved. Just algebra and
              trig. I was given equations to solve. Often for a range of values
              for an independent variable. Then I would usually plot the points
              on graph paper and connect them using a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_curve">French
                curve</a>" (which has no relation to fashion or to foreign
              actresses). The company made small, custom designed, precision
              transformers, used in hi-fi equipment or in aero-space. I
              progressed from plotting data to performing experiments to gather
              the data I plotted.&nbsp; They would give me a prototype of a new
              design and a range of conditions they wanted it tested under, and
              I would connect it to an instrument called a "Maxwell Inductance
              Capacitance Bridge" -- carefully stopping the testing if the
              transformer seemed about to self-destruct. I had had physics in
              high school and a little in college, but this was on-the-job

                  style="width: 20%;; float:center;">The heart of my new
                department's computing power was this overgrown adding machine,
                the IBM 402 Accounting Machine, which relied on punched cards
                for data and on a plug wired control panel for its
                "programming."The extent of the work force I supervised was just
                one solitary key punch operator. I wired the control panels for
                the machines and operated them. Even though I worked for the
                treasurer and we did the company's accounting in our data
                center, our main concentration was information retrieval (as
                described in the next footnote. </p>

              <p> (Aperture Cards)The chief engineer had all his engineering
                drawings microfilmed, the photo of each drawing was inserted
                into an "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture_card">aperture
                  card</a>" -- a regular sized punched card with a rectangular
                slot for inserting the film. A classification code he'd devised
                was punched into the card. I wrote a short text book on how to
                encode a diagram, we trained a bunch or employees how to encode
                the diagrams and were off and running. They had thousands of
                designs, so when a new Request for Quote came in, it was
                impractical for an engineer to manually check if they'd built a
                similar transformer before. Now they could search for similar
                previous designs, which significantly decreased the time to
                create a new design (if needed) and to more accurately estimated
                the costs to produce.</p>

            <li id="AgfaAnsco">(Ansco) The company had started out in NYC
              pre-Civil War, as Anthony and Scoville, a pioneer in the
              photographic industry. The firm sponsored photographer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Brady">Mathew
                Brady</a>'s project to document the Civil War and resulted in
              countless iconic photos of Lincoln, Grant, Sherman, soldiers and
              battle scenes. The company soon moved to Binghamton, and renamed
              themselves, 'Ansco.' Later they were purchased by a German film
              manufacturer, Agfa, and the US photographic operations were
              renamed 'Agfa-Ansco.' For some reason, the blue-coller workers in
              the Binghamton area, would say, "I work at the Anscos." Agfa was
              acquired by a German conglomerate, I. G. Farben. At the onset of
              WW2, the US Dept. of Justice seized Agfa-Ansco (and some sister
              chemical and building products companies) as "enemy owned." It
              continued to operate as a private company, but the Attorney
              General appointed its directors. A decades long law suit resulted,
              based on Agfa's assertion that shortly before the war, I. G.
              Farben had sold the business to a Swiss company, Interhandle, and
              therefore the seizure was illegal. Finally there was an out of
              court settlement under Bobby Kennedy and the stockholders once
              more elected the directors. Not very wisely, IMHO, because shortly
              thereafter, a majority of the board were allies (some would say
              'cronies') of the chairman, and GAF went downhill fast. It's many
              divisions were sold off or went out of business.</li>
            <li id="IBM650">
              <p>(IBM650) That computer, which targeted both the scientific and
                general purpose computer markets -- both still getting underway
                -- had a somewhat bizarre design. It's calculations were done
                via vacuum tubes, which was the norm then. But one thing that
                seems unusual was its "memory." Previous computers use various
                approaches to working memory, including vacuum tubes or
                electro-mechanical relays.The 650's memory was a rotating
                magnetic drum, similar to those used in the Xerox copiers of the
                day [as did a few other computers]. It's name came from the fact
                that its memory could store a maximum of 650, ten digit "words"
                -- i.e. 3,250 bytes. Remember, this was a best selling mainframe
                computer,&nbsp; widely used in universities and major
                corporations.&nbsp; By contrast, the early home computers such
                as the Comodore-64, Atari, Apple-2, Radio Shack TRS-80 typically
                had 64,000 bytes -- twenty times as much. And smartphones now
                have at least 64,000,000,000 bytes of memory.</p>
              <p>Computers of that era had no operating systems. The computer
                operator was their "operating system." They had no ROM
                (Read-Only-Memory) to automatically "boot" them. If you turned
                them off -- EVERYTHING was erased. The operator had to go
                through a manual "boot" procedure to start them up. While at IBM
                Owego, I didn't actually operate the computer, I just used
                punched card sorting and collating machines to prepare the input
                data stream for the computer. </p>
            </li>
            <li id="ThreeEnvelopes">
              <p> (3 Envelopes) Once upon a time, a person started a new job,
                managing a department. Their predecessor hadn't left yet and
                would "teach the ropes" to the new manager. All went well, and
                on the last day, the old manager said, "I know you'll do well,
                but there are rocky stretches in any road. In this drawer, I've
                left three sealed envelopes for you, carefully marked #1, #2 and
                #3. If you should ever find yourself in trouble and worried
                about your job security, just take out the first envelope and
                read it. Ditto for the other two if the need should ever arise.</p>
              <p> Things started out beautifully, but eventually hints and
                strange looks, signaled danger of losing the job. Time for
                envelope #1. Inside envelope one was a brief message - "Blame
                your predecessor." Sure enough, that worked.</p>
              <p>But after while that excuse wore thin and it was time for
                envelope #2. It's message was even briefer. Just one word
                'Reorganize.'</p>
              <p> That worked beautifully and there was smooth sailing again --
                for a while.</p>
              <p> Finally it was time to open envelope #3. It's message was
                slightly longer -- "Make out three envelopes." </p>
            </li>
            <li id="StanRogge">
              <p> (Stan Rogge) Stan was my first office mate at GAF. I didn't
                report to him then, but he was the "old-hand" at the company and
                helped me get off on the right foot. He was "self-made." During
                the war, he served with the Army Air Corps in Germany. After the
                war he took a job with GAF as an inspector in their Quality
                Control Dept. And used the GI Bill to attend Triple Cities
                College nights, and earn a BA. He also married a fine woman, Jo
                Anne, whose mother was a sister of industrialist-inventor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Albert_Link">Edwin
                  A. Link</a>. (Ed owned and was president of the company my
                father worked for and was on a first name basis with all his
                "old hands." My father didn't grant his respect to many people,
                but he liked and respected Ed Link.)</p>
              <p> Stan never forgot his QC "roots" and we always worked closely
                with that department. One of the things that made Stan and Cal
                great managers was that they realized people are different and
                want different rewards. Some want money. Some want impressive
                job titles. Or a bigger office or bigger desk. Some want lots of
                recognition and "strokes." Etc. And they realized that I loved
                learning, so being sent to classes, seminars, conferences, etc.
                kept me happy. It meant much more to me than raises (although I
                never turned any of those down). And that I worked hardest when
                managed with "a light hand on the reins." So many managers treat
                people as interchangeable parts, forcing every "peg" into
                whatever "hole" their job description specifies. Stan and Cal
                were good at identifying people's strengths and tailoring what
                they asked of them to best utilize each person's strengths. They
                also modified their management style to fit the situation and
                individual. Many managers aren't able to do that. And they
                realized the importance of allowing work to be fun. I enjoyed my
                first several years there so much that I sometimes felt guilty
                about being paid for something that was so much fun. </p>
              <p>Another amazing skill Stan and Cal had was to build a great
                department our of misfits whose managers didn't want them. The
                company went back to Civil War days, so some departments had
                become very bureaucratic. Those managers saw subordinates who
                had lots of ideas as to how to do things better as "boat
                rockers" and were happy to get rid of them. Stan and Cal
                welcomed them aboard as crew, absorbed the boat rocking and made
                the department a flagship of innovation and a "lifeboat" to
                those wanting better ways of doing things. </p>
              <p> I think Stan hired Cal and immediately made him his right hand
                man. Stan rose through the ranks swiftly. He selected Cal as his
                successor. As Stan moved up in the organization charts, most of
                his promotions were quickly followed by Cal and our department
                rising up in the organization charts too. Eventually Stan was in
                charge of our entire division. He was too professional to say
                why he left, but I suspect it was from frustration at corporate
                HQ overruling his recommendations. </p>
              <p> He left to become VP of Manufacturing at Quality Mills, an
                apparel and textile manufacturer in Mt. Airy, NC. Cal followed
                and eventually I did too. I think the good-old-boy wasn't as
                interested in change as much as he'd led Stan to believe, so
                Stan retired, but took over as president of a company he'd
                become associated with that made Lincoln Log style parts, with
                which kids could build log cabins they could play in. He was a
                well-organized, hard working visionary, with great people
                skills.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="CalBesore">
              <p> (Cal Besore) [See also the footnote on Stan Rogge, it contains
                a lot about Cal.] Cal was a wonderful and very talented man.
                When in the army, he'd helped build the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Highway">ALCAN
                  Highway</a>. He received a BS from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_Institute_of_Technology%20">RIT</a>
                in Photographic Engineering and a masters degree in statistics
                from the University of Illinois where he programmed <a hreff="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILLIAC">Iliac-1</a>
                as part of his studies. He was skilled as a programmer, but for
                him, writing a program was only a means to an end, not an
                activity that interested him per se. He had a command of
                physics, chemistry and math that enabled him to function as a
                human slide rule. a slide rule only gives answers with an
                accuracy of the first three digits of the result. Cal could look
                at a complex problem and say, "the answer should be about 2.73."</p>
              <p> Oddly, I met his wonderful wife, Dot, long before I met him.
                You may recall that I mentioned that I did market research
                polling while in college. For many of those surveys, Dot was my
                supervisor.</p>
              <p>Like Stan, Cal was a great manager. You may remember that I
                worked harder for teachers I liked. I worked best when given
                guidance when needed. but under "a light rein" most of the time.
                I worked my ass off for Stan and Cal. They were quite tolerant,
                but one time Cal warned me. I was very active in the Civil
                Rights movement locally and went to demonstrations locally, at
                the UN and in the famous 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and
                Freedom. He warned me that company policy was very firm. If I
                was arrested and the company's name appeared in the news
                article, e.g. "William Thompson, GAF employee", firing was
                mandatory and there would be nothing he could do. I was almost
                killed once when a counter-protestor drove his car into a picket
                line I was in, but I was able to jump aside in time. And I never
                was arrested for anything. </p>
              <p>Cal had a booming, resonant bass voice that carried
                magnificently. I was once asked by a caller "Is Cal there?" I
                recognized the caller and replied "I don't hear him, I don't
                think he's in the building." He knew all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_and_Sullivan">Gilbert
                  and Sullivan</a> songs and broke out singing them often. His
                falsetto rendition of "<a href="https://genius.com/Gilbert-and-sullivan-three-little-maids-from-school-are-we-lyrics">Three
                  Little Maids</a>" was unforgettable. </p>
              <p> We were office mates for a while and his use of power naps was
                miraculous. A short nap just left me tired and grumpy, but he
                would wake up refreshed. And would wake up precisely when he
                intended to. He also loved "<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/old_saw">old
                  saws</a>" such as "You should be on the stage, there's one
                leaving at noon" and could be depended to deliver them whenever
                the conversation presented an opportunity presented. If I hadn't
                liked him so much, that would have been annoying.</p>
              <p> His timing on when to give advise was excellent. Unless time
                was of the essence, he often would wait until I expressed
                frustration or gave the proper opening before offering advise.
                One time I was working on a project and knew he would have used
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics">multi-variate
                  statistics</a> to address it, so I quickly studied them and
                discovered how to apply them. But ran into a problem because the
                variables I was working on interacted (as do heat and
                temperature when baking -- if you raise the oven temperature you
                need to decrease the baking time and vice versa) so I couldn't
                use that technique. He just quietly said, "Have you tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors">eigenvectors</a>?"
                I'd never heard of them, so I hadn't. I read up on them and
                discovered that they are sometimes called "factor analysis," and
                are just a way of mathematically transforming data from one set
                of numbers in which the variables interact (like time and
                temperature in the case just mentioned) to a different set of
                numbers in which the variables don't interact. A whole new world
                had opened up! He never wasted the company's money by letting me
                flounder, but realized I'd learn more by discovering the right
                path on my own.</p>
              <p> Much of my knowledge of applied math came from reading
                technical journals. He had much more formal education in
                statistics than I did, but he was good at recognizing aptitude
                and giving credit. One time a scientist came to us wanting
                assistance in finding the line that would best fit his rather
                complex data. The chemist knew that the answer wouldn't be a
                straight line, but wasn't sure how to proceed. Cal said, "Bill
                can help you with that, he has a better feel for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression
                  analysis</a> than I do." Cal had lots of expertise, but never
                let ego get in his way and was great at giving credit when it
                was due. No one ever gave me better help or guidance! I miss
                him.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="1620">(IBM 1620) The 1620 was an odd duck. It had 10,000
              bytes of memory (as opposed to the 20 years in the future
              Comodore-64's 64,000). It's memory was made of tiny doughnut
              shaped cores of iron ferrite, organized in decimal digits rather
              than binary digits, and having variable length computer words.
              (Most computers had fixed word lengths.) Most computers have
              special circuits to do arithmetic ("adder" circuits &amp;
              "floating point hardware") but the 1620 had look-up tables to do
              math. Which led some to nickname it "CADET" (for "Can't Add,
              Doesn't Even Try" -- odd for a device marketed as a scientific
              computer). Like most computers of that era, it had no operating
              system. It was booted by flipping switches on the front of the
              console a number of times, pressing an ENTER button to load each
              array. It's keyboard was a standard IBM electric typewriter with
              print keys, not a type ball. The carriage return came back with a
              vigorous whack. There was a metal guard, which protected males
              standing next to it. But served as a trap for females leaning over
              it. It was considered "inexpensive," because it sold for about
              $88,000 or leased for about $1,200/mo. Adjusted for inflation,
              those amounts come to about $874,000 and $12,000, respectively.
              Input devices such as punched card readers, paper tape readers,
              magnetic tape drives or disk drives could be attached via cable.
              As could output devices such as card punches, paper tape punches,
              magnetic tape drives, disk drives or high speed printers. It was
              usually programed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">FORTRAN</a>,
              but there were assemblers and a wide variety of compilers and
              interpreters for most any of the programming languages of the day:
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL">ALGOL</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNOBOL">SNOBOL</a>,

              etc. Usually you would load a compiler by reading a large deck of
              punched cards. And then load a deck of cards that was your
              program. And the data for the program would be one or more punched
              cards -- or data entered via the typewriter. We didn't have a
              staff of key punch operators, every one created their own punched
              cards.</li>
            <li id="Statistics">
              <p> (Statistics) I think I had an aptitude for that field. I think
                everyone should be exposed to some of its key ideas in high
                school. Certainty may apply to theology, but probability reigns
                everywhere else. For example, you'll hear a newscaster proclaim
                "Candidate X leads candidate Y in the polls 47% to 46%." Either
                from ignorance or to "dummy down" the report for their audience,
                they ignore the poll's "margin of error." Pollsters always
                report that, but news people tend to ingore it. Typically, for
                polls it's 3%. Therefore, candidate X's support is somewhere
                between 50% and 44% and candidate Y's support is somewhere
                between 49% and 43%. Any time the difference is less than the
                margin of error, the results are tied. Regardless of your
                interest (or lack thereof) regarding politics it's important to
                realize that almost everything you deal with is a matter of
                probabilities and what that implies.</p>
              <p>Aptitude. In many fields of math, when you're studying them
                there's an "Ah hah" moment, where every thing instantly falls in
                place. It seems to me that in statistics the key is learning how
                to look at the problem and asking the right question about the
                problem at hand. Once you ask the right question and look at the
                problem the right way, everything about how to address it falls
                in place. </p>
            </li>
            <li id="ScientificComputing">
              <p> (Scientific Computing) I'm going to first describe the field
                in general, and then my "realm." The field of scientific
                computing was vastly different from the commercial computing
                world of accounting oriented programming. It still used analog
                computers or specialized digital computers. And different
                languages. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL">ALGOL</a>
                (for "Algorithmic Language") was favored in academic circles and
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">FORTRAN</a>
                (Formula Translation) in industry -- vs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>)
                COmmon Business Oriented Language) in traditional data
                processing. The first typically involved making large amounts of
                calculations on small amounts of data vs comparatively simple
                calculations on massive amounts of data. A scientific program
                might only be used once, by it's author, who was a scientist or
                engineer for whom the program was a personal convenience and a
                means to an end vs a program used routinely by some one in a
                data center and often written elsewhere&nbsp; by someone who
                specialized in writing programs for others to use and for whom
                writing programs was their professional <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/raison_d%27%C3%AAtre">riason
                  d'être</a>. Programmers of business applications often only
                knew simple arithmetic, but tended to know accounting practices
                and knew the importance of "idiot proofing" data entry against a
                wide variety of potential data entry errors. A scientific
                program might run for more than a week to produce a single
                number as an answer, but with high accuracy. A typical data
                processing program had to process many transactions per minute,
                but with answers rounded off to the nearest penny. Those two
                kinds of programmers lived in different worlds and tended to
                look down on each other. But both were considered as
                "applications programmers" vs "systems programmers" who wrote
                "device drivers," compilers, etc. (products that facilitated how
                and what a computer did) and were written in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembly
                  language</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code">machine
                  language</a> and tended be employed by computer manufactures.
                In my many years of working with computers, I did at least a
                little of most everything, but hated systems programming.</p>
              <p>Initially my role in scientific programing at GAF was to assist
                scientists and engineers in the company's Photographic Division,
                which was in Binghamton, with their programming needs. I taught
                programing classes for them, and helped them when they got
                stuck. And I even though most of the people in our Plant
                Statistics department could do their own programming, I ended up
                writing programs to process our department's data. As well as
                teaching courses on how to design and analyze experiments and
                helping researchers design and analyze experiments. Word spread
                to scientists and engineers in other divisions in other GAF
                divisions and in time, we supported scientist and engineers all
                over the country. And manufacturing and QC departments who had
                needs their local data centers were unable or unwilling to
                support. Not surprisingly this generated some ill will.
                Especially when engineers or scientists said "my local data
                processing department couldn't help me but those guys in
                Binghamton did." Sometimes the other divisions' DP departments
                would refer their technical users to us. Some of the chemical
                engineering departments had analogue computers, but I think we
                were had the only digital, scientific computer in the
                corporation.</p>
              <p>However, resentment towards us festered with our local DP
                department. They felt we should report to them, not to
                manufacturing (we won the battles but the war was eventually won
                at the corporate level when all the data centers came under a
                single corporate director, instead of reporting to local
                divisions). </p>
            </li>
            <li id="GADSAR">
              <p> (GADSAR) Al Starke coined that acronym for our project, "GAF
                Document Storage and Retrieval System." It's goal was to index
                the chemical compounds referred to in the Chemical Divison's
                extensive collection of internally written papers and reports. A
                key problem was how to describe chemical compounds in a form
                that was compatible with the computer input of the time --
                punched cards. The character set on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keypunch">IBM
                  026 key punch machines</a> was a slightly reduced character
                set of what was available on most typewriters. (The character
                set for UNIVAC SperryRand's key punches was similar.) The
                American Chemical Society has a complicated, but very thorough <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_nomenclature">set
                  of rules for naming compounds</a>. It involved Greek letters,
                subscripts and superscripts, but those were not insurmountable
                road blocks. But its rules were complicated and many "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_chemistry">bench
                  chemists</a>" had not mastered them. An indexing system would
                do no good if its users didn't know how to name what they were
                looking for.</p>
              <p><img src="ChemStructure.png" alt="A chemical structure diagram"
                  style="width: 20%;; float: right;">A preferable method would
                have been using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_formula#:%7E:text=The%20structural%20formula%20of%20a,shown%2C%20either%20explicitly%20or%20implicitly.">chemical
                  structure diagrams</a>, all chemists used and understood them.
                But devices for entering or displaying drawings were not yet
                available. Dr. Starke had already chosen WLN (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiswesser_line_notation">Wiswesser
                  line notation</a>) as the solution. It was widely used in the
                pharmaceutical industry and well suited for keypunch entry.</p>
              <p>WLN was fine for entering a description of what a chemist was
                searching for, but it was not very good for computer programs
                trying to match a segment of a molecule. A more suitable
                approach for the computer to use internally was an "<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja00896a022">atom
                  to atom connectivity matrix</a>." (All those are is a simple
                table containing one row for each atom in the molecule and one
                column for each atom. Think of it as a spreadsheet. The cell
                where row x and column y intersect is empty if those two atoms
                aren't connected. If they are connected, the cell contains a
                code for the type of chemical bond that connects them. Ernie
                Hyde and Lucille Thompson, of Imperial Chemical Industries'
                Canadian subsidiary, and Bill Wisswasser had already published a
                <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja00896a022">paper</a>
                on their method of converting WLN to a connectivity matrix. I
                created a program and wrote my master's thesis on the converse -
                producing a WLN from a connectivity matrix. GAF's GADSAR team
                (Al Starke, Gene Carson and I plus a outside, part-time
                consultant, Dr. Fred Whaley published a paper on the subject,
                written by Fred and presented by Fred at the International
                Federation for Documentation's 1967 conference in Tokyo. (As a
                souvenir, I have a reprint, in Japanese, of the paper as it was
                first published in the proceedings of the conference. [An <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.5090190213">English
                  version of the paper, as Fred originally wrote it</a> was
                published later.] We met with Ernie and Lucille a couple of
                times and I spent a long session with Bill Wisswesser at his
                home in Reading, PA. He was a Lehigh grad and had taught there,
                so I donated my materials on the project to the Lehigh Library

                  Kill</a> from Staten Island -- a MUCH higher cost of living
                area -- and with no salary adjustment. I couldn't afford to take
                that job and if I quit GAF and took a job in the Bethlehem area,
                I would lose my pension rights -- I wasn't fully <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-vesting#:%7E:text=%E2%80%9CVesting%E2%80%9D%20in%20a%20retirement%20plan,it%20back%2C%20for%20any%20reason.">vested</a>,
                that took being employed 10 years. Returning to my old job
                seemed a better choice and I hoped to complete my degree in
                absentia. Good intentions, but the overtime needed by the
                project absorbed my time. The degree would have been nice, but I
                didn't need it. [Years years later I ran into my thesis advisor
                at conference. He told me that my credits had expired, but if I
                paid&nbsp; tuition to reinstate them he would approve my thesis
                and they would grant the degree. In effect, they would sell it
                to me for $30,000. Except for a college teaching position, I
                didn't need the degree and would get no return on the

              <p> (DEC) DEC's success was based on the belief that the
                mini-computer was the wave of the future and would surpass
                mainframe computers in importance. Their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-8">PDP-8</a>
                and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11">PDP-11</a>
                were huge successes. They had already announced their next
                generation of computer, the hugely successful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX">DEC-VAX</a>.
                They hadn't put all their eggs in the same basket, they had a
                great mainframe computer, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECSYSTEM-20">DECSYSTEM-20</a>,
                arguably the world's best personal computer of that period, the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_100">Rainbow 100</a>.
                Standalone word processing machines were still popular and their
                DECmate was competitive with similar Wang and Brother products.</p>
              <p> After a whole bunch of courses on DEC's hardware and software,
                I debuted in my new job in sales support. I worked out of their
                sales office in Syracuse, NY. Our territory was all of NYS above
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westchester_County,_New_York">Westchester
                  Co.</a> The salesmen were reasonably knowledgeable about
                hardware, but most were not very knowledgeable about DEC's
                software. So, if they were concerned about the client or
                prospect having technical questions about the software, they
                would ask a software specialist to accompany them. We weren't
                trained in sales, just in software, so we were discouraged from
                saying anything except when asked. (Most computer companies paid
                their salesreps on commission, but DEC paid them a straight
                salary (but evaluated them against a dollar quota.) used a
                Commuting from Binghamton to Syracuse could be challenging in
                mid-winter because some stretches of I-81 were prone to
                whiteouts. I had a company car. That helped make up for the huge
                sales territory we had to cover. That 1st year I drove 50,000
                miles so it was good to have the wear &amp; tear on their
                vehicle. I found all the travel disorienting. I would wake up in
                a strange room and wonder "What town am I in? What
                customer/prospect an I calling on today? What am I supposed to
                talk about?"</p>
              <p>At that time, DEC's operating systems were customizable. When a
                salesman sold a computer, once it was delivered, the software
                specialist would usually visit and install the operating system,
                customizing it to the customer's needs. Most of the computers
                had fairly low price tags, so that sales support&nbsp; incurred
                too much overhead and after my 1st year, the sales support
                positions were all eliminated. Instead, we were used as
                consultants, visiting the customers by ourselves (my favorite
                customer was Corning Glass); or rented out as contract
                programmers. I didn't mind, I thought it was a good business
                decision. And since all of the system specialist positions were
                eliminated, I didn't take it personally.</p>
              <p>I had a varied set of assignments. One of the most challenging
                and interesting was at a nearby GE plant that handled aerospace
                contracts. They had a contract from McDonnell-Douglas to build a
                flight control system for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F/A-18_Hornet">F/A
                  -18 Hornet</a>. (In 2022 the F/A-18 starred in the exciting
                movie, <i>Top Gun: Maverick</i>.)</p>
              <p> GE had built many flight control systems, but this was their
                first one that was all digital. A unique and important design
                spec is that it use a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly-by-wire">fly
                  by wire</a>" design. "Fly by wire" simply means that there in
                no direct, mechanical or hydraulic connection between the pilots
                control in the cockpit and the ailerons, tabs, etc. that are to
                be controlled. (Eliminating the hydraulics saves weight and cost
                and improves the plane's combat capabilities.) In fly by wire,
                the flight control computer is the only connection. For example,
                traditionally a pilot pulled back on the stick or yoke to make a
                plane climb. How far back and how fast the pilot pulls back
                directly controls the related moving parts. If the pilot "asks
                too much" of the plane, the wings may break off. But the F-18s
                flight control system was designed to prevent that. If the pilot
                pulled all the way back on the stick, the flight control
                interpreted that as "give me the maximum rate of climb that the
                plane can give without the wings falling off." The flight
                control system had to take into account the plane's current air
                speed, altitude, attitude, weight, specifications, etc. and
                execute the maneuver safely. And making those decisions very
                quickly in combat conditions. That's what made the F-18 so
                formidable. (And capable of the extreme maneuvers called for in
                the movie's story-line. It was crucial that the flight control
                system was free of "bugs." A failure during a test flight would
                mean the loss of the crew's lives and the loss of a 65 million
                dollar plane. The cost of a failure during combat, could be
                astronomical and super catastrophic.</p>
              <p> So GE hired DEC to check their software, and I was in charge
                of DEC's team. GE's flight control system had to be redundant,
                it had to keep running even if a computer failed. GE used four,
                identical computers, all running the same software and all
                communicating with each other, as the flight control system.
                Quadruple redundancy. We attached process control computers to
                "spy" on the instructions each of GEs computers were executing
                and to monitor the communications between their 4 computers. And
                of course to see if all were doing what they should be. My crew
                was all very good and didn't need much "babysitting."</p>
              <p> You've all watched a marching band, where suddenly a member
                realizes they are out of step and does a hop or takes one or two
                short steps to get back in synch. GE had an algorithm to
                determine if any of their 4 computers got "out of step" and if
                so, to get them back "in step." Or, if one of their computers
                "got sick," to disable them. I wrote a program to simulate the
                performance of their algorithm and make sure there weren't any
                bugs in it's performance.</p>
              <p> Apparently the DEC crew did our job and the GE crew did
                theirs, because I never heard of any failures of their control
                system. Before we bid adieu to the F-18 project, I want to
                praise GE's project manager Loren. I've never seen any one who
                could multi-task anywhere near as well as he. And his project
                management skills were phenomenal. As I recall, he was managing
                a project that used between 80 and 100 people at a given time.
                And he seemed to have the entire project plan in his head and
                know the status of each task in the project plan and of where
                each player was in his tasks. That doesn't seem possible, but he
                sure gave a good approximation to doing that. He was
                outstanding. </p>
              <p> DEC next assigned me to a year long project in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glens_Falls,_New_York">Glens
                  Falls, NY</a>, a town I loved. My family relocated there,
                which was hard on my elder son, who was starting 12th grade and
                had to say goodby to his classmates. :( I won't bore you with
                the project details, but it involved systems programming, which
                I've never enjoyed -- and a weekly trip to Nashua, NH, crossing
                both the Green and White Mountains, which could get hairy in a
                rear wheel drive car. 3.5 hours in good weather. And in winter
                sometimes the roads would close. </p>

            <li id="MtAiry">
              <p>(Mt. Airy) We worked for a textile and apparel company. Cal
                worked for Stan, who was VP of manufacturing. I reported to the
                VP of Finance. The DP Manager reported to him, and on paper, was
                my manger. I thought of him as a good-old-boy and golfing buddy
                of the owner and couldn't be fired. He liked to sit in his
                office all day and manually sort "job tickets." So we usually
                let him do that to his heart's content and usually ignored him.
                Which made for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_wicket">sticky
                  wickets</a> occasionally, but most of the time worked fine.
                Officially my job title was "Manager of Systems Analysis," but
                in reality I functioned as the DP manager. </p>
              <p> When I first arrived I had a couple attacks of "foot-in-mouth
                disease." A friendly fellow in the sales department asked me
                "How are things going for you?" Usually I'm fairly guarded in
                what I say, but this time I answered, "Good, except with the
                manager of ___. She's pretty stubborn and hard to work with." He
                grinned as he&nbsp; replied, "I know, she's my mother." Oops!</p>
              <p>Most of the work the department did was routine accounting
                functions, but from time to time Cal tossed a meatier problem my
                way, usually having to do with quality control, inventory
                control, or production control. For instance producing "<a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/picking-ticket">picking
                  tickets</a>" for filling customer orders from the finished
                goods inventory that listed the items to be picked in a sequence
                that would minimize how many steps the picker would need to take
                to complete the order. The company's inventory control system
                worked fine for showing the worth of the inventories: finished
                goods, work-in-process, or raw materials. But it was useless for
                telling how many shirts you had that were blue, or in what size.
                So much of my effort was working with the production control
                manager and warehouse managers to rework their inventory systems
                so that you actually knew how much of what you had and where. I
                also worked a lot with my staff to upgrade their skills and to
                produce programs that could be maintained much more easily,
                incorporated modern techniques, and could easily be generalized
                to address more issues.</p>
              <p>I don't think the owner wanted to improve things as much as
                he'd led Stan to believe, and Stan retired to dabble with a
                large scale "Lincoln logs" company for kids. The production
                control manager I'd become friends with was fired because of a
                misunderstanding. And then a major flood hit.</p>
              <p>Mt. Airy is in kind of a bowl, at the base of the Blue Ridge.
                The remnants of a hurricane stalled over the town and dumped
                rain on it for days. The river rose 26' in just a few hours.
                Many of the textile and apparel mill workers who were working
                that night barely escaped with their lives. And many of the
                factories and/or their contents were destroyed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The concept behind the S/38's architecture, IBM's Future
                Systems Project, was great, but the IBM divisions it was
                designed for didn't appreciate it. IBM's small business division
                gave it a chance and over the years it evolved from the S/38
                into the AS/400, then System i, and finally became the "IBM
                Power Systems."</p>
              <p>Be that as it may, we assembled a good crew of employees, the
                machine arrived and we got to work. The corporate data center,
                in my opinion, disliked losing a profitable, captive customer,
                an did not provide the degree of cooperation that I'd been led
                to expect. Corporate used an IBM/370 mainframe, but because most
                of their programs were in COBOL we could have modified them
                quite easily to run on our S/38. Nor did we have much luck
                getting hold of the documentation of what their programs did or
                how. We partially solved that by hiring a contract programmer
                who had done a lot of work for the corporate data center to do
                contract programming from us which enabled us to learn a lot
                about what their software did and how. But through no fault of
                his own, he led to my early departure.&nbsp; </p>
