        Dear Cousins:

        Another year has rolled around and finds us, as did the last, working
        hard for our living and pleasures. One must keep things moving to make
        the first, and take his chances at getting the other, but we seem some
        way to work both to our advantage.

        home, but outside of that he is selling hardware and trying to teach
        the would-be farmers just what is the best kind of machinery for their
        particular farm. In all we seem to have wintered well and to have come
        through pretty hale and hearty.

        Yesterday was the first day of trout fishing season, and I had to get
        the old pole out and try my luck. It was cold and rainy, but a friend
        and I went anyway and nearly got the law's limit apiece. Anyway, 'twill
        "make the spider make several turnings."

        Business prospects in Oregon are very good just now. Lumbering is going
        on at capacity and farm products are at a fair price now with hope of
        better. Farmers in our locality re-seeded about sixty percent of their
        fall seeding which was frozen out (a thing unknown before), and
        everything is green and smiling again.
      </p>
<p>
        We were gladdened greatly last year by the nice visit of <span wc_id="I773">
        Llewellyn</span> and <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel</a> who drove
        through from Mansfield in their car<sup>1</sup>. It was our busy season
        while they were here, so we were unable to take them around much. But
        they are good goers and were all over themselves. We surely did enjoy
        their stay and only wish that others of our kinfolks would "take to the
        road" and wind through the mountains and come and see our hustling,
        happy Williamette Valley, if they don't care for their kin! Why not
        make a vacation trip and drive out? We have the finest roads in the
        world and plenty of sunshine and good air. Western cousins can
        entertain as well as the eastern ones, and there are none better than
        the Campbells.
      </p>
<p>
        Hoping some of you can travel this way and wishing you all the best of
        the good things of this world for the coming months.

        1. Their round trip was 10,225, an amazing trip considering the roads
        and cars of that day. It's described in her <a href="CCCV3p052MabelShaw.html">letter</a>.
