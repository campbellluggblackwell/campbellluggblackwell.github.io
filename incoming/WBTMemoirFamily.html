              <p><a name="WalterFThompson1893">Perhaps all people are
                  complicated if you know them well. I see my father as
                  complicated. He had an unfortunate childhood that left him
                  scarred. He was verbally abusive to my siblings and me, and
                  took his razor strap to my older brothers, but "mellowed" with
                  each child and became a loving grandfather. He lived in a
                  world of simple, but rather rigid, distinctions. People were
                  either "good" or "bad." One transgression by a friend of
                  decades was unforgivable -- they were crossed off his list. A
                  neighbor from Dublin used to say "He hangs his fiddle outside
                  the door." I think meaning that he was convivial with his
                  coworkers and fishing buddies, but distant from his family.</a></p>

                  Frederick Thompson</a>, was born in 1893, in Plattsburgh, NY
                to a tubercular, immigrant <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47214">father</a>,
                who died when dad was two and had no memories of; and a nurse <a
                  href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bulley-101">mother</a>,
                whom he didn't know well. When she was widowed with two young
                children, she left them in the capable hands of her <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/LaPlante-601">mother</a>,
                and moved to Williamsport, PA to work at the hospital she had
                graduated from, and to live with an older sister, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bulley-467">Mary
                  Jane (Bulley)</a> LaBelle.</p>
              <p>Dad and his older brother, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47213">Maurice</a>
                were raised on a farm, by grandparents they loved. His
                grandmother was born in this country, to a French speaking
                family (they were near the border with Quebec). His grandfather,
                born Michel Boulé in Canada but reportedly renamed Mitchel
                Bulley by the Sergeant that mustered him into the Union Army.
                The family spoke French at home and attended a church with a
                French speaking priest who gave the homily in French. "Gram," as
                he called her, had 11 children of her own, and raised 3
                grandchildren: dad, his brother and their first cousin, Harmon
                Bulley, who was 7 years younger. Those were reasonably happy
                years, altho his immigrant grandfather (who had had been wounded
                in three battles, survived two Confederate POW camps and had a
                wooden leg) was quite strict.&nbsp; But he felt loved. However,
                when dad was about twelve, his mother married a doctor, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Burnley-143">George
                  C. Burnley</a>, and dad &amp; Maurice joined their mother and
                step-father, who had just moved to a home in Nelson, PA.</p>
              <p> That was not a happy home. According to my father, their new
                step-father was an alchoholic who beat both boys and their
                mother when he was drunk. He and Maurice never forgave their
                mother for taking them from their grandparents. After four years
                she died. But before that, he and his brother had been
                practicing boxing so that one day they could defend themselves.
                I think when he was about 14 and Maurice was 15, their
                stepfather started to beat them, but they successfully fought
                back, beat him up, and ran away from home. But not before he met
                my mother.</p>
              <pa>The two brothers wandered around, together, for a while, doing
                odd jobs, including a stint as janitors in a bordello. (I heard
                that from my mother. He would never have mentioned such things
                to me or my siblings.) Eventually they made their way to
                Williamsport, to the home of his aunt and her husband, Leonidas
                Ovide LaBelle, who was a machinist and apparently taught dad the
                basics of the trade. I didn't know any of this when I was
                growing up, just that dad and his LaBelle cousins were close.
                They often visited us, and we them, and we once took a vacation
                with one and his family. As I mentioned, dad and Maurice never
                forgave their mother, and refused to put a marker on her grave.</pa>
              <p>At the time, local school districts only had to provide
                education to 8th grade. That was the end of dad's formal
                education, but he was an avid reader and knew history quite
                well.</p>
              <p> When he was old enough, he joined the navy, and became a
                machinist on board a primitive submarine of the day. The US
                Navy's experimental designs of the K-series of subs were more
                dangerous to their crews than to enemy ships.</p>
              <figure><img src="K1Sub.png" alt="Photo of US Navy K-series, pre WW1 subs"
                  style="width:25%; float:right;">Pre-WW1 US Navy K-series sub.
                They didn't see combat, but were used for patrolling coasts.</figure>
              <p><a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47213">We no
                  longer have a photo of his boat (subs are 'boats,' not
                  'ships'), but I think his was the </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_K-5_%28SS-36%29">K-5</a>.
                They were used primarily for the Navy to figure out submarine
                tactics. I know he was stationed in Pensacola, FL. He used one
                leave to make a visit to Nelson, as a suitor. He apparently made
                a dashing figure in his uniform - enhanced by playing a
                mandolin. [He didn't "swear like a sailor." The only times I
                heard him swear was when hanging wall paper. Usually he relied
                on phrases such as "dagnabbit," "fiddlesticks," "hell's bells,"
                or "Jehoshaphat's ghost."] </p>
              <p>He was injured when an explosion or fire broke out in the
                engine room and took a discharge well before WW1 broke out. They
                married in 1916, after mom finished her 3rd year at Mansfield
                Normal School (which was all that was required for secondary
                school certification).</p>
              <p>He set some good examples for us: honesty, hard work, civic
                responsibility and the value of craftsmanship. I don't remember
                him ever saying it, but he clearly believed that children were
                to be seen, but not heard. His factory shift worked from 6 AM to
                3 PM, so he would go to bed early. And thump on the bedroom
                floor with a shoe. If that didn't quiet us long enough, he would
                wrap himself in a blanket (he didn't wear pajamas), come down
                the stairs far enough to be visible and GLARE. He had no need to
                say anything. And his glares were more eloquent than anything he
                could have said. He has a special one for every occasion.</p>
              <p>He had a stoic outlook and admired the Spartan boy's stoicism.</p>
              <blockquote> One of the most famous stories of Spartan discipline
                was about a boy who found a fox cub, which he planned to eat.
                When he saw his instructor approaching, the boy hid the fox
                inside his garment to avoid being caught. As the instructor
                questioned the boy, the fox began to claw and bite within the
                folds of the boy's tunic, yet the boy did not cry out. According
                to the legend, it was only when the boy fell dead to the ground
                with his stomach bitten through that the instructor realized
                what had happened. </blockquote>
              <p> (That's not my idea of behavior to emulate.) </p>
              <p> He raised us on maxims I can still hear, echoing around in my
                brain.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>"Better to be thought a fool than to speak up and remove all
                  doubt."</li>
                <li>"You get what you pay for."</li>
                <li>"Say what you mean &amp; mean what you say."</li>
                <li>"A place for everything and everything in its place."</li>
                <li>Bragging was a no-no. "Don't toot your own horn." And
                  feeling sorry for yourself was a no-no too.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> If we said "That's now what I meant to say, the inevitable
                response was "Then why did you say it?" And long before my time
                he would ridicule Tom in front of the whole family by referring
                to Tom as "That damned fool."He never struck me (only threatened
                to). As I mentioned earlier, he took his razor strap to my
                brothers and his leather slipper to spank my sister. My mother
                used her hair brush to spank me.</p>
              <p> He was something of a misogynist. When my mother would have a
                group of women over, that was a "hen party." And the attendees
                were "biddies" or "battle axes." But he also had pejoratives to
                describe males: "blowhard," "stuffed shirt," or in the case of
                my father-in-law - "weak sister." (That was for crying at his
                daughters' weddings, something he felt no "|real man" would do.)
                And gender neutral put-downs such as "holy roller." As you can
                see, he could be very judgemental.</p>
              <p>He wanted us to grow up with excellent grammar and good
                manners, especially table manners. Some what incongruously, in
                order to teach us not to put our elbows on the table, offending
                elbows were subject to being jabbed with his fork. </p>
              <p> <img src="LaFayetteSedan.png" alt="Photo of Nash LaFayette sedan, ca. 1937"
                  style="width:20%; float:right;">He was industrious. An
                excellent vegetable gardener, diligent pruner of grapevines,
                berry bushes, shrubs, etc. Replaced a long, laid field-stone
                front walk with one where the field-stones were set in concrete,
                carefully prepared gravel underneath. Built a large, stone
                fireplace in the back yard for grilling for picnics -- it even a
                range top. He did home repairs of all sorts and was especially
                proud of his painting skills; - mowing the meadow with a scythe;
                spending hours on his hands and knees, hunting errant dandelions
                with an old table knife to remove their roots (a custom I
                continued). And of course, tools were cleaned and put away.
                "Take care of your tools and they'll take care of you." During
                WW2, when Detroit wasn't making cars, did a great job of keeping
                our family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaFayette_Motors">Nash
                  LaFayette</a> running.</p>
              <p>He appreciated nature, but seemed to need a fishing pole or a
                gun in hand as an excuse to go for a walk. He would often take
                the family for a Sunday drive to see scenic views or when the
                fall colors were at their peak. </p>
              <p>In politics, like all family members of Civil War veterans, he
                was a Republican. He had no use for Harry Truman, whom he
                considered "vulgar." He was comfortable with Republican
                "liberals," such as <a href="">Nelson Rockefeller</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Javits">Jacob
                  Javits</a>. But he did finally bring himself to vote for a
                Democrat for mayor -- who happened to be the brother of a family
                friend. </p>
              <p>He had no patience with religiosity of politicians who "wrapped
                themselves in the flag." He derisively referred to them as "200%
                Americans." Speaking of religion, he believed in God and an
                afterlife (and Providence), and was a close friend of our
                minister, sang in the church choir (he had a good bass voice)
                and would say grace for occasions such as Thanksgiving, but he
                wasn't "churchy." I think he mostly went because that's just
                what one did. Theology or doctrinal points had no interest for
                him (nor for me).</p>
              <p>He loved music, and if possible, never missed a performance of
                "Saturday at the Met." He had no interest in dance, and not much
                in art.</p>
              <p>He wasn't good at managing money, it tended to burn a hole in
                his pocket and there was always a new fishing reel or rod that
                he coveted. </p>
              <p>Speaking of fishing, he enjoyed telling tall tales (or tails)
                about fishing. He didn't consider it lying, because the listener
                should have know better that to give credence to preposterous
                stories. (Nor did he consider omissions as lying. Only what you
                actually said counted.) Some of his tall tales were quite long
                (as were the fish that got away). One of the shorter ones was
                abut the fishermen out on a lake. <i>"They caught so many fish
                  that the level of the lake went down so much that they ran
                  aground and had to walk all the way to shore, carrying as much
                  of the catch as they were able to."</i> (Inspired by such
                stories I once told one of my grandchildren, who liked to watch
                ducks and geese on a lake "It rained so much one day that the
                water level in the lake rose so much that only the geese' heads
                were still above water,") Anyone who didn't recognize "whoppers"
                for what they were was "a damned fool." He did like "pulling
                people's leg" and had a dry, wry, sense of humor.</p>
              <p>His favorite jokes to tell had punch lines that listeners had
                to supply for themselves. E.g.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>"What's the difference between a
                  cross-eyed hunter and a constipated owl?"<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cross-eyed hunter can't hit when he
                  shoots."</i><br>
                The listener was on his/her own to figure it out on their own.</p>
              <p>He was a perfectionist, who had high standards for everyone,
                himself included. Standards that were impossible for any child
                to meet. We became quite expert at interpreting his scowls and
                varied looks of disapproval. I hope his grandchildren
                encountered approval, but his children didn't. No matter how
                hard we tried, nothing we could do was ever "good enough."</p>
              <p>To his credit, he tried to teach me how to bowl, one of his
                favorite indoor activities. He showed uncharacteristic patients
                in showing me how to hold the ball, to walk with it, release it,
                etc. I vividly remember one occasion. I almost threw a strike.
                One pin wobbled a while, but stubbornly remained upright. After
                the pins had been reset, and I was preparing to throw my 1st
                ball, he carefully showed me how to position my hand and wrist
                -- just so. I observed carefully, tried hard to remember all the
                fine points, really concentrated in following his instructions
                -- and rolled a strike. I was elated and hoped for some sign of
                approval. But as I returned, all he said was "Now the next time,
                you need to hold your wrist more ..." Even throwing a strike
                wasn't good enough. :( </p>
              <p>But he could be supportive. Especially when it came to my
                efforts to free myself from my mother's over protectiveness. I
                had picked up a lot of wilderness skills in Boy Scouts and
                Explorer Scouts and was anxious to lead "expeditions" to the
                Adirondaks with myself and one or more classmates. He was always
                an ally on winning approval for such trips, and always was
                willing to chauffeur either the drop-off trip or the pick-up
                trip. Initially they were for one week, later for two. I was
                very emotionally immature, but my hiking, canoeing, camping, and
                navigating skills were advanced. The trips all went fine.</p>
              <p>He wasn't anti-social. He played board games and especially
                enjoyed playing cards -- hearts, pinochle (he was very good at
                that), canasta or other rummy games -- but not bridge. We would
                often play at home evenings. And on Friday or Saturday nights,
                they would get together with friends for two or three tables of
                whatever.</p>
              <p>He didn't like my mother trying new recipes. Often he would
                refuse to try the dish. He would pointedly leave the table
                (often taking his dishes with him, making a bowl of bread and
                milk and either eating it in the kitchen, standing up, or
                sometimes, bring the bowl back to the dining room table and eat
                it there.</p>
              <p>He was very supportive of my sister when her first husband
                would misbehave. She (and her son) were always welcomed back, to
                stay as long as needed. He made it very clear to his son-in-law
                that anything he did-unto-her would be done-unto-him -- with
                interest. No one considered those warnings as empty threats. He
                never begrudged those "refugee" visits. My parents had opposed
                the marriage. One night my parents, sister and I (the whole
                household at the time except for my grandmother, who I think had
                gone to bed, discussed her choice. My sister was 30, and I was a
                grown-up (I thought) 14. I defended my sister as being old
                enough to make her own decision on such an important issue. My
                father said, "Shut up and sit down or I'll knock you down." So I
                did. I don't know what else was said, but obviously she did
                marry him.</p>
              <p>Which brings me to his grand-parenting. I'm confident that I
                was a better father than he was, but he may have been a better
                grandfather than me. He didn't like his son-in-law (for cause),
                but didn't take that out on his grandson. However, he intensely
                disliked one daughter-in-law (also for cause) and took it out on
                his granddaughter (mostly by ignoring her). My mother took him
                to task. "Walter, you're not being fair." (Calling him 'Walter'
                was a sure sign of a lecture.) It's not your granddaughter's
                fault who her mother is. She's a victim, not a perpetrator. Stop
                being mean to her." And he did. He liked both grandchildren (and
                three more who came along later) and treated them with
                consideration and kindness. He did evolve.</p>
              <p>I mentioned in a previous chapter that he chewed tobacco,
                usually Five Brothers pipe tobacco. Sometimes he would light up
                a pipe of it, but usually he chewed it instead. Nicotine is a
                good herbicide, so in his war on dandelions, he often would
                target them when he spat. His aim was pretty good, especially
                when tossing popcorn or peanuts into the air above his head,
                tipping it back and catching the popcorn kernel or peanut in his
                mouth. (But not while chewing tobacco.)</p>
              <p>As he aged, he did not "go gentle into that dark night." He had
                a series of heart attacks, but did not want to follow the
                doctors' advice about changing his diet or being less active.
                "That's not living." (I couldn't understand at the time, but do
                now.) He didn't quite get his wish of "dying with his boots on."
                He had another serious heart attack but survived and was going
                to be discharged. I visited him at the hospital and planned to
                talk with a nurse about whether he would be discharged that day
                or the next. He was sitting in an easy-chair and we were
                chatting about his release, when suddenly he had convulsions and
                collapsed. I yelled "Nurse, nurse", but it was a massive
                coronary and he died before the staff could arrive -- even
                though they came running. He would not have wanted to survive as
                an incapacitated invalid -- he would have felt "a burden."</p>

                    trepidation. I see her as complex, and don't feel I
                    understood her as well as I did my father. </a><a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hoyt-211">Jessica

                    id="JessicaHoyt-ref"></a> was born in the small town of
                  Nelson, PA, (near Corning, NY) in 1892. She was the eldest of
                  three daughters of Joseph DeForest Hoyt and Frances Viola
                  Goodrich, but was "the apple of her father's eye." And
                  according to her mother, very spoiled as a result.</p>
                <p>It was a small town, big enough to have a RR station, hotel,
                  livery stable, two churches, a barber shop, post office and
                  several small businesses, and served as a market place for the
                  surrounding farms. Her great-grandparents were founders of the
                  town, so she grew up in "one of the best families." Not
                  wealthy, but active in he community and well respected. Her
                  father was a farmer, who sometimes also operated a small
                  store. Her maternal grandfather was the Methodist preacher and
                  both her grandfathers were Civil War veterans and well
                  respected. She was proud that she had multiple ancestors who
                  were early settlers of the colonies, coming to MA, CT and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Amsterdam">New
                    Amsterdam</a> in the early 1600s. And very proud of being a
                  DAR member. (My dad's ancestors were early settlers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_France">New
                    France</a>, coming with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_de_Champlain">Champlain</a>.)</p>
                <p>Perhaps because her family had been very involved in their
                  community, we were brought up with a strong sense of community
                  responsibility and civic engagement.</p>
                <p>Her rather idyllic childhood came to an abrupt end at the age
                  of 10, when the father she adored dropped dead at age 42. They
                  lost the farm and she and her sisters and mother moved in with
                  her maternal grandparents. But it was very cramped and four
                  more mouths to feed was a strain on her retired grandparents
                  income. As a result, she moved in with her father's sister, <a
                    href="https:/www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hhoyt-3455">Inez (Hoyt)</a>
                  Boller and her husband, (my namesake), <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Boller-100">Billy
                    Boller</a>. Their two children had died very young, and they
                  welcomed mom as if she was their child. Mom called Inez
                  "Auntie." Inez was fond of all three of her nieces, but she
                  and mom bonded. And Billy Boller was fond of her. My siblings
                  and I had no living grandfathers and so wecalled him "Grampa
                  Bill."</p>
                <p>She grew up on the Boller's farm, which in Inez' day was
                  called "Rose Lawn Farm," but was weather beaten and in need of
                  paint by the time I started visiting. We spent much of the
                  summer there. Before my time Tom had an ill-tempered pony
                  there, named "Betty." (I assume that was her name when Grampa
                  Bill bought her rather than being named after my mother's
                  sister.) My siblings all had fond memories of "Auntie," but
                  she died soon after I was born, so I had no memories of her.
                  She loved the Boller's sheep farm. Most of his income came
                  from selling the lambs to a slaughter house each fall, but of
                  course he also sold wool. And had a side job of a "milk
                  route." He would get up before dawn each day, leave with his
                  old Reo stake bodied truck, and drive his assigned route,
                  picking up the dairy farmers milk cans, taking them to a
                  nearby condensary (a plant where raw milk was turned into
                  condensed milk and canned). He would return the empty cans the
                  next morning when he picked up that days milk.</p>
                <p>My visits there were invaluable for introducing me to what
                  life was like in the 1800s. It had no electricity, no indoor
                  plumbing, no central heating. On one side, next to the kitchen
                  door and side porch, was a hand pumped well. The outhouse was
                  on the opposite side. Kerosene lamps provided the light at
                  night. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potbelly_stove">pot
                    bellied stove</a> provided the only heat. And kettles placed
                  on top provided the hot water to pour in washtubs for Saturday
                  night baths. Each bedroom had a wash stand, with a large bowl
                  and pitcher for washing up in the morning. And a commode
                  (cabinet to hold a chamber pot).<img src="Commode.png" alt="Photo of a combination washstand-commode (i.e. a cabinet to hold a chamber pot"
                    style="width:20%; float:right;"> Crawling into a cold bed in
                  an unheated bedroom in winter was nothing to look forward to
                  so rectangular soap stones, with a handle, were heated on top
                  of the stove and then used as bed and foot warmers. It made
                  you appreciate modern conveniences. In summer, cooking was
                  done on a two burner kerosene, table top stove. I especially
                  remember the mattresses, which were stuffed with dried corn
                  husks and made a lot of noise when you rolled over. Getting up
                  on a cold winter morning, with the room temperature not much
                  above freezing inspired getting dressed under the covers, as
                  much as was practical. When I hear people waxing nostalgic
                  about "the good old days," I think of what daily life was
                  really like then. And all the children's graves in the
                  cemetery. Lifespans then were not too different from now --
                  for those who lived to adulthood.</p>
                <p>One consequence of growing up on that farm was that she never
                  wanted to have lamb or mutton again, and never cooked it for a
                  meal. But she loved that farm and the memories it held for
                  her. Wm. Boller left it to her when he died. She kept it for
                  several years, but couldn't get out very often and reluctantly
                  sold it.</p>
                <p>After graduating she went to Mansfield Normal School and
                  lived in a dorm.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#NormalSchool"
                    id="NormalSchool-ref"></a> At that time, two years at a
                  normal school was required for a certificate to teach primary
                  grades (1 - 6) and a third year to teach secondary grades (7 -
                  12). Mom got her primary certification, taught for a year in
                  Nelson, returned to Mansfield for her secondary school
                  certification, and in 1916 married the handsome ex-sailor
                  who'd courted her with the mandolin. (NYS recognized PA
                  certification, so she was able to teach there.)</p>
                <p>They first lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Winfield,_New_York">West
                    Winfield, NY</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Brookfield,_New_York">North
                    Brookfield</a>, but soon settled in the Binghamton area,
                  where she usually taught is small, rural schools. Dad and his
                  brother-in-law, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Walker-36158">Roy
                    Walker</a>, who lived nearby, enjoyed fishing in <a href="https://thecolgatemaroonnews.com/14662/news/the-loomis-gang-and-the-ghost-of-wash-loomis/">Nine
                    Mile Swamp</a> (as did their sons later).</p>
                <p>Mom returned to Auntie's in Nelson for the birth of her first
                  two children, "<a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47215">Tom</a>"
                  (Walter, Jr. in 1917) and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47216">Anne</a>
                  in 1919. (Her mother was living and working in Elmira, NY
                  then. <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47217">Hank</a>
                  was born in Binghamton in 1922. (I was an "afterthought" much
                  later.)</p>
                <p>Her sister Isabelle graduated from Mansfield Normal School
                  and taught Phys Ed in the Elmira area. I think Isabelle and
                  her mother lived together before her marriage, but after
                  Isabelle married in 1925, gram lived with her and husband Tom
                  Field. Isabelle was childless and wanted to adopt me, but mom
                  declined, which may have been fortunate for me because
                  Isabelle died 2 years later from meningitis. And gram came to
                  live with us.</p>
                <p>The Depression years were tough, with dad being unemployed or
                  underemployed much of the time and Hank getting polio, but we
                  survived (but moving often). WW2 brought relative prosperity,
                  but mom gave up teaching when I was diagnosed with rheumatic
                  fever.</p>
                <p>She was active in the community, teaching Sunday School,
                  holding offices in the PTA and Presbyterian Women's
                  Organization, the church choir (until she "lost her singing
                  voice"), the somewhat prestigious Garden Club and and had been
                  active in the Grange. She was active in several women's bridge
                  clubs, painted and had great flower gardens. I always
                  mistakenly thought she somehow managed to join the exclusive <a
                    href="https://whichmuseum.com/museum/phelps-mansion-binghamton-11705">Monday
                    Afternoon Club</a> -- that's what the sign still read. But
                  apparently they had gone out of existence and she just
                  belonged to a group that met there (perhaps the Garden Club).
                  I do know that she attended regularly, whatever the group's
                  name was.</p>
                <p>Her DAR membership meant a lot to her. I'm pleased that in
                  1939, when the DAR refused to let <a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/04/09/298760473/denied-a-stage-she-sang-for-a-nation">Marion
                    Anderson use their concert hall</a>, she, like Eleanor
                  Roosevelt, resigned in protest. </p>
                <p>In those days the country was awash in prejudice. The KKK
                  openly held parades in most cities. Mayors and public
                  officials often openly supported them. Racial stereotypes were
                  ubiquitous: Rastus and Mandy jokes, black-face performers like
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jolson">Al Jolson</a>
                  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minstrel_show">minstrel
                    shows</a>.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#MinstrelShow"
                    id="MinstrelShow-ref"></a> A common expression was "There's
                  a Ni**er in the woodpile." Brazil nuts were called "Ni**er
                  toes." Kids blythely counted "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeny,_meeny,_miny,_moe">Eeny
                    meeny, miny moe</a>, catch a ni**er by the toe."</p>
                <p>So, in some ways she was progressive for her times and
                  happily supported Nelson Rockefeller, she also believed in
                  preserving our country's WASP (White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant)
                  cultural traditions. Immigrants were welcome, but needed to be
                  "Americanized" and assimilated to understand, appreciate, and
                  embrace those values. And we, as descendants of the early
                  colonists, had a special obligation to help "enlighten" the
                  foreigners. The emphasis seemed to be on the benefits to them
                  (and the country) of their adopting our values. As was typical
                  for her generation, there seemed little awareness that their
                  culture and traditions could enrich American culture and life.
                  One story in particular illustrates the "mixed messages" of my
                  childhood. The first African-American family (whom I'll call
                  "The Smiths") was moving into our neighborhood. Some of the
                  neighbors were very upset and wanted to oppose it, but mom was
                  very supportive. However, her support, as I recall, was worded
                  "I'd a lot rather have good Ni**ers like the Smiths as
                  neighbors than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polack">Polacks</a>
                  like [those who] live next to me now." (BTW, the Smiths moved
                  in and resided without incident, but were not invited to
                  neighbors' picnics.)</p>
                <p>She had cardiac issues all her life and in later years,
                  severe rheumatoid arthritis (sometimes painting with brushes
                  strapped to her hands) and later a series of stokes and
                  dementia.</p>
                <p>Their marriage wasn't conflict free,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
                    href="#Won_theWar" id="Won_theWar-ref"></a> they often
                  fought and even went through a trial separation in the early
                  1940s.</p>
                <p>She was a worrier. Overprotective of me. Insisted on picked
                  out my clothes almost until I graduated from college. Loving
                  but inhibited and not demonstrative. She'd read a popular book
                  on parenting that said you shouldn't pick up a crying child or
                  you'd spoil them and felt duty bound to stifle her "maternal
                  instincts." I don't recall either parent ever saying "I love
                  you" or once I reached school age, ever hugging me.</p>
                <p>And I see her as "meddling" in her children's lives. I've
                  already mentioned her opposition to my marrying Rachel or
                  Dottie. And I believe she campaigned against my brothers
                  "getting involved with" Rachel's sisters.&nbsp; And to my
                  sister's first marriage. But she'd also weighed in against her
                  earlier suitors. And was adamant when my brother considered
                  divorce to protect his kids from abuse. In part that was
                  practical -- "No court is going to grant custody to the
                  father." [Which was probably true then.] But also as a matter
                  of reputation -- "Divorce isn't what we do." She and I had a
                  showdown about her countermanding my orders to my kids. "It's
                  a grandmother's prerogative to spoil her grandchildren if she
                  wants to." (I won that one.)</p>
                <p>She had some great recipes (most of which were closely
                  guarded secrets). Her usual cuisine was traditional New
                  England. Meat wasn't done if it hadn't fallen off the bone
                  yet. But she was a skilled baker. Huckleberry tea cakes were
                  her <i>crème de la crème</i>. But she made great creme puffs,
                  eclairs and popovers. [I make good popovers too.] And she made
                  very good pies, her chocolate pies are fondly remembered (but
                  all her pies were good).</p>
                <p>She was extremely hospitable. Family friends who lived alone
                  were always invited to our holiday meals. And anyone present
                  as mealtime approached would be invited to stay to dinner even
                  if that required a miracle of loaves and fishes to stretch
                  what she had planned to serve in order to accommodate one
                  more. She, and my sister both denied they took it seriously,
                  but both liked to read guests <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasseography">tea
                    leaves</a>. I recall many occasions in which my mother would
                  begin doing a reading -- then suddenly become disturbed at
                  what she saw, her facial expression would markedly change and
                  she would quickly break off the reading, making some excuse
                  such as the leaves had become rearranged. But they both
                  believed they had "powers." My sister also read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmistry">palms</a>.
                  One supernatural incident in particular comes to mind. They
                  both were certain that at the moment Tom was injured they both
                  woke up from frightening dreams and "knew" that something
                  awful had happened. Of course it was weeks before they
                  actually knew the details of when he was injured. A telegram
                  did soon come from the War Department informing my parents
                  that he had been injured and was in a hospital, but the
                  specifics of what day and hour didn't come out until much
                  later.</p>
                <p>Her sense of humor was very different from my father's and
                  seemed that of the Victorian Age. She loved saying things like
                  "I scream or ice cream." And "Railroad crossing, look out for
                  the cars. Can you spell it without any cars?" Or "Beach, birch
                  and maple, all begins with 'A.'"</p>
                <p>She especially liked to draw the following story, which you
                  were invited to read aloud:</p>
                <blockquote> A B C D <img src="Fish.png" alt="Goldfish sillouette"
                    style="width: 47px; height: 24px; float:none;"> ?<br>

                <p> See footnote for the "correct" answer.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"

                  seems pretty dumb, perhaps that proves that you're not a
                  Victorian :)</p>

                  their proclivity to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism">euphemisms</a>,

                One of the scars that I think the Victorian mindset inflicted on
                families was the tradition that family skeletons must be hidden
                away in well locked closets. Put out of sight and out of mind.
                Some of this may be tied in with&nbsp; a sense of shame and fear
                of damaging the family's reputation in the community. But these
                things are all part of life. And everyone's family has
                experienced one or more of them. A relative committed a crime or
                was raped. (My uncle Maurice accidentally killed a neighbor.) Or
                had a child out of wedlock. Or had mental illness. Or was
                addicted to alcohol, drugs, gambling or whatever. My father
                wouldn't talk about his Uncle Kearney -- didn't even want his
                name spoken in the house -- I don't know why, nor did any of
                Kearney's grandchildren have a clue what that was all about.
                I've read in the papers about one adulterous cousin who was
                involved in a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/m%C3%A9nage_%C3%A0_trois">ménage
                  à trois</a> that resulted in a trial and newspapers' field
                day. The rational given for secrecy is often to protect
                children, but as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemony_Snicket">Lemony
                  Snicket</a> and <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/magination/4416428">Margaret
                  Holmes</a> have shown, that may not always be the best way to
                protect children.
                <p></p>
                <p>Both of my parents enjoyed antiques. They would shop at
                  dealers and flea markets, buy pieces they liked. Dad would
                  refinish them if needed. If chair seats needed re-caning or
                  their splint or reed seats replaced, they would usually pay to
                  have that done. If the piece didn't have beautiful wood, dad
                  would often paint it black and mom would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stencil">stencil</a>
                  it, often in guild. Sometimes the refinishing would remove
                  some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patina">patina</a>
                  and decrease the piece' value as an antique, but the result
                  was always a handsome piece of furniture. Mom collected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry_glass">cranberry

              <p><a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47215">My elder
                  brother</a> was my hero. He was kind and considerate to me. (I
                already mentioned his taking me for walks in his Adirondak
                pack-basket when I was a toddler.) I can't count all the things
                he introduced me to: puns, camping, poetry, Tolkien, folk music,
                how to identify sassafras and when to harvest it, and countless
                more. I couldn't wait till I was old enough to follow in his
                Adirondack paddling and hiking "footsteps."&nbsp; I was "Billy"
                to everyone else, but he always referred to me as "Willie" when
                I was a kid. He enlisted in the Army when I was a first grader,
                but always sent me things which I cherished -- rattlesnake
                rattles from the Mohave desert. A Navajo thunder-bird ring. Sea
                shells from the Pacific, etc. His letters home included "Tell
                Willie ..."</p>
              <p> He was superbly trained by the army. They sent him to the
                Mojave Desert to train for North Africa, but by the time he was
                finished they didn't need him in Africa anymore, so they sent
                him to Mt. Rainier, to train for fighting in Italy's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apennine_Mountains">Appenine
                  Mts.</a> But by the time he graduated from that training they
                decided they needed him in the Pacific, and sent him to Hawaii
                for more training. Because he was taller than average, he was
                assigned to carrying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle">BAR</a>
                (a light machine gun usually fired prone supported by a bipod (a
                two legged support), but carried via a shoulder strap and
                capable of firing from the hip as you walked. He first saw
                action in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea">Papua
                  New Guinea</a>, where he came to know and like a village of
                head hunters. "They're nice fellows as long as you stay on their
                good side." The Japanese committed atrocities and hadn't stayed
                on their good side, so the locals were glad to help guide the
                GIs.</p>
              <p>After that fighting was over, he was sent to northern Australia
                for R&amp;R, and then to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindanao">Mindanao</a>,
                for more combat. And finally to Luzon, where his mountaineering
                training was put to use as the allies moved toward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baguio">Baguio</a>.
                His unit held a ridge in the mountains, protecting an Army
                Engineering crew building a road to Baguio for the advancing
                army. After weeks of being ahead of their supplies and having to
                live off of rice taken from the knapsacks of Japanese soldiers
                they'd killed, his company came under an intense artillery
                barrage and suffered 70% casualties in a half an hour. He had <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_guilt">survivors'
                  guilt</a> because he saw his best buddy disintegrate from an
                exploding shell. Tom was badly wounded, losing the use of one
                lung and carrying countless pieces of shrapnel (they would work
                their way out for decades). But he was sure that he would not
                have survived had his buddy, who was between Tom and the
                explosion, not absorbed the worst of the blast. While in a field
                hospital for months, he contracted malaria, which would flare up
                repeatedly over the next several years.</p>
              <p>To understand Tom, you need to know that he turned down
                repeated attempts to promotion to sergeant and remained a
                corporal. "I didn't want to order men to their death."
                Eventually he was moved to hospitals in San Francisco and DC,
                before recovering enough to be discharged. After getting his
                Purple Heart and other medals, he was offered disability, but
                declined. "I can still work."</p>
              <p>But like every combat veteran from WW2, Korea and Vietnam that
                I've known, he suffered from PTSD for the rest of his life. (In
                WW1 they called it "shell shock" and "battle fatigue" in WW2.
                But "real men" were supposed to be able to tough it out and not
                need help. Of course back then it wasn't well understood and the
                meager help available often wasn't much help.)</p>
              <p>Before he enlisted, he's met Anna Gretna Walker, sister of a
                close friend of his. Additionally, she was a friend and coworker
                of my sister. He and Gretna corresponded through is army years
                and married as soon as he was well enough. He went to Triple
                Cities College in Binghamton on the GI Bill (one of the best
                investments the US government has ever made) and got a BA in
                botany. Then, loving history, he attended the NYS College for
                Teachers in Albany, for an MS to teach HS history. But,
                discovering he didn't like his student teaching experience, upon
                graduation, took a job as an electronics technician at Link
                Aviation, where my father worked. He later transferred to their
                "Contracts" department where he negotiated with NASA and the DOD
                about contract specification details. (I didn't come on my
                versatility and ability to take on jobs with zero experience by
                pure chance.) I didn't get to see him much during his college
                years, he was pretty busy. But we always felt "connected."</p>
              <p>The second major trauma in his life was the death of twin sons
                when they were only a couple of days old. He wouldn't consider
                counseling and I think he was deeply scarred the rest of his
                life. He would visibly flinch when he encountered boys the age
                they would have been. And for a long time avoided my sons. Mom
                tried to encourage him and Gret to adopt, but he refused to
                consider it. He came back from the war still believing in God,
                but couldn't forgive him for allowing the carnage of WW2. He
                never again went in a church, except for weddings and funerals.</p>
              <p>For a while he had a cabin cruiser, based near Ithaca. But he
                spent many hours canoeing and many more in boats on lakes and
                rivers of all sizes, which is why he probably developed a
                melanoma on a leg that wasn't discovered until it had
                metastasized. That was in the days before the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/affordable-care-act/">ACA</a>
                when insurance companies controlled most of the health care
                calls, and while he was getting radiation treatment for his
                cancer, his insurance company announced, "Sorry, you've reached
                your lifetime cap,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#LifetimeCap"
                  id="LifetimeCap-ref"></a> no more health insurance coverage
                for you. </p>
              <p>Speaking of funerals, there's a "small world" story about his
                funeral. After he was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer, a
                neighbor asked permission to tell the pastor of his nearby
                church. The pastor, whose church was just a few blocks away, on
                the same street, did visit. He was from the Philippines. At the
                time Tom was wounded, the pastor was a boy, hiding in the
                jungle, a few miles from Baguio, so they had a lot to talk
                about. The visits continued and they became friends. That pastor
                was invited to do a scripture reading at Tom's funeral. His
                presence was a big surprise to Tom's nephew's wife. He had been
                her youth pastor when growing up in Clarke Summit, PA. "It's a
                small world after all."</p>
              <p>Tom was multi-faceted. He was an excellent photographer,
                especially of blossoms. He had a sharpshooter medal from the
                army and participated in many target shooting meets, I think
                becoming a NYS champion. He was a talented wood carver. He
                hunted, fished, hiked, and canoed. He liked minerals, picking up
                specimens of semi-precious gemstones such as garnets and many "<a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herkimer_diamond">Herkimer
                  diamonds</a>." He filled 3 walls of his basement with a model
                train layout with bridges and tunnels that accommodated several
                trains simultaneously. He spent countless hours building RR cars
                for the trains, buildings, trees, shrubs, etc. He was very
                active in the Masons,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#Lodges"
                  id="Lodges-ref"></a> both in his local lodge, but also
                statewide, popular because he had memorized so many of their
                rituals that had to be recited at various ceremonies. He would
                delve deeply into a hobby for several years, then put it aside
                and move on to new territory. He had a fine collection of
                antique glass and continued adding to that. </p>
              <p>Fishing remained a constant. He and Hank both went through
                periods of serious creators of trout flies and Hank made larger
                pieces, such as a "mouse" lure for bass. Dad and Hank continued
                to be avid trout fishermen, but all also did boat fishing for
                bass and Northern pike. Dad also liked to catch perch for
                eating. Both Dad and Tom would fly to remote areas in Quebec and
                northern Ontario in one of Link's planes and company pilots, a
                free benefit offered&nbsp; "old hands." </p>
              <p style="">I live just south of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocono_Mountains">Poconos</a>
                (they're more like hills than mountains, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmia_latifolia">mountain
                  laurel</a> country). He loved photographing them (and dogwood
                blossoms), so each spring, when I saw that they were blooming, I
                would give him a "heads-up" phone call. For years after he died,
                when I would see their blossoms come out I would automatically
                think "I've got to alert Tom" -- and then feel sad when I
                remembered there was no need to call him. When he was a botany
                major, he impressed his professors with photographs he took
                through a microscope of single celled plants and had a talent
                for dyeing portions of a cell to provide better contrast. In
                later years he often used high magnification camera lenses to
                shoot tiny blossoms, barely visible to the naked eye, or close
                ups of lichens. For years he had his own darkroom where he
                developed and printed his photographs. I still have albums of
                his Adirondak hiking and canoe trips. And a small hard bound
                book he used when writing poems, short stories or verbal
                sketches. He liked capturing legends of Navajo and Pacific
                Islanders.</p>
              <p> When it became clear that he only had weeks left to live, I
                wrote him a letter, outlining how much he'd meant to me. I'm
                very glad I did that -- it meant a lot to him. When it became
                clear that he only had days left, I went up to Binghamton for a
                final visit -- staying at my sister's apartment. There already
                were blizzard warnings before I left her apartment to go to his
                home to say goodbye. I had the car radio on and when I was less
                than halfway there I heard the announcement that the sheriff had
                declared a state of emergency and closed the roads. I figured
                that it was now or never -- that if I turned around he'd be dead
                before the roads were reopened, and so I pressed on. Mine was
                the only car on the road. Main St. in Johnson City was NY17C --
                two lanes each direction, with two lanes for parking. It was
                hard to see because it was snowing so hard. So I drove down the
                middle of the street (blinkers on), with the driver's window
                open so that I could scrape the windshield with one hand as I
                drove. Somehow I made it to his house and we said our goodbyes.
                I was glad I'd come, but the return trip to my sister's was some
                of the most challenging I'd ever done -- what with how hard it
                was snowing and how much had accumulated. But I'd grown up
                driving in NYS winter conditions, and made it back to my
                sister's OK and without being arrested. (I was always prepared
                for getting stuck in the snow. I had a sleeping bag in the car,
                so I wouldn't freeze. A shovel to dig out of a drift. Reflectors
                and flares to set out to reduce the chances of being hit. Etc.)
                He died the next day. It was 3 days before the state of
                emergency was lifted, so if I had turned around there would not
                have been another opportunity.</p>

            <p> I've previously mentioned that my siblings often seemed more
              like uncles and aunt. But my <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47216">sister</a>
              at times seemed almost like a second mother. And she was the one I
              felt safest sharing confidences with. (And with whom I may have
              set a record for the most times helping someone else move (and
              rearrange furniture). [I think she was only partially kidding when
              she said she was frustrated with an apartment she had on
              Binghamton's Park Terrace Pl. because she couldn't rearrange where
              the fireplace was located. :) ]</p>
            <p>I spent many hours with her gardening -- especially on a rock
              garden near a small lily pond dad built. And countless hours in
              walks through woods and fields, where she taught me how to
              identify wildflowers. (And occasionally steal some for
              transplanting.)</p>
            <p>I suspect that being a girl shielded her from much of the verbal
              abuse Tom was subjected to. But she may have been subjected more
              to the tugs and currents of the rivalry between mom and gram.</p>
            <p>She had strong people skills and many strengths: talent in art,
              embroidery, poetry, etc., but lacked self-confidence in some
              areas. Part of that was because of an injury she suffered as a
              teen where she broke her nose. It was rebuilt, but was not "A
              Thompson nose." Probably that was all for the better, but she was
              self-conscious about it. She was dyslexic, which may have been why
              she never graduated from high school. (She always felt
              self-conscious about that.) Instead she completed <a href="https://www.univstats.com/colleges/ridley-lowell-business-and-technical-institute-binghamton/">Ridley-Lowell
                Business School</a>'s secretarial training where she learned
              typing, shorthand, filing, etc. It definitely was why she never
              got t drivers license. </p>
            <p>I believe there are many different types of intelligence,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
                href="#IntelligenceTypes" id="IntelligenceTypes-ref"></a> but
              hers were markedly different from the rest of the family, which
              sometimes led to feelings of inadequacy.</p>
            <p>She had a strong sense of fashion, and as a teenager filled
              notebooks with fashion sketches. She worked in clay, water color,
              oils, charcoal and loved pastels. Being a "Sunday painter" ("a
              nonprofessional painter, usually unschooled and generally painting
              during spare time") was an important source of satisfaction to
              her. I'm not sure about the "unschooled" part. I know she took
              night school courses from two of Binghamton's best
              water-colorists. And she studied painting in oils from
              Binghamton's most prominent portrait painter. I believe there was
              more training, but I'm not sure of the details. She was also
              active in the arts and crafts scene, having her own candle making
              studio, roadside stand and participating in arts and crafts shows.
              Perhaps the Met wouldn't have bought any of her works, but I think
              many had considerable appeal and merit. If she ever tried to sell
              any of her art, I'm not aware of it.</p>
            <p>She wrote some poetry, had a small library of the works of
              Whitman, Longfellow and others, but her favorite poet was Emily
              Dickinson.</p>
            <p>She also collected antique demitasse cups and small tea sets.</p>
            <p>I never regarded her as a particularly good overall cook.
              (Successfully making jello remained elusive.) But she had some
              dishes that were very good.&nbsp; And she excelled at making a
              meal out of whatever ingredients were on hand and feeding her
              family on a limited budget.</p>
            <p>She worked at a variety of jobs. Secretarial jobs with insurance
              agencies. Being in charge of the candy counter at Sears -- that's
              where she met future husband George Gibson -- he worked for Sears
              as an appliance repairman. And she had a long and well appreciated
              job with Red Cross.&nbsp; All a boss had to do was say something
              like "Send a thank you letter." Or, "Send congratulations," etc.
              and she'd take it from there. She had a feel for marketing. One
              year her candy counter had a lot of candy canes left over after
              Christmas.&nbsp; They weren't selling at 10¢ apiece, so she put up
              a sign saying "Special. 2 for 25¢" and quickly sold out! </p>
            <p>She was "unlucky in love." I liked some of her suitors who my
              parents disapproved of and think some would have made better
              husbands than she ended up with. Her first husband, George, always
              treated me fine, I have no complaints there. But he didn't do as
              well by his wife and son. He was a navy cook in the south Pacific
              during the war. And he did very good impersonations of Jerry
              Lewis. But he had issues, especially with his employers and
              honesty. As I remember it, the only reason he wasn't prosecuted is
              that my parents and their lawyer visited the DA and got charges
              dropped. </p>
            <p>But indirectly, he played a role in my getting to hear my
              favorite poet, e.e cummings, do reading. He needed a bunch of
              tests done at the VA hospital in Syracuse. And needed another
              driver to come along, so I went with him. It was going to take
              several hours, so after dropping him off, I went to the nearby
              campus of Syracuse U. to look around and kill time. I had just
              started walking around, when a poster caught my eye. It announced
              that cummings would be giving readings at something or other hall
              in ten minutes. I asked directions, hurried off, and arrived at
              the lecture hall just in time. Seeing him in action as he brought
              his works to life -- and listening to his pauses and speed ups,
              changes in inflection and pitch was so very instructive about how
              he wanted them to sound. Someone just reading a page would have no
              idea how animated he wanted a 'Whee' to sound -- or the different
              voices he used. I am grateful for that, but it doesn't atone for
              George's misdeeds.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>After several years of being a single mom, she married Herb. He
              was older, a retired IBM factory worker. He owned his home and had
              a good pension and benefits. And savings. I suspect she saw
              financial stability and a home for herself and her son. But it
              didn't work out as she had hoped. As time went on, Herb's drinking
              problem grew. One morning she called and said "He hit me last
              night. Come get me." I was happy to oblige and immediately left
              and retrieved her and as many belongings as we could fit in the
              car. (We went back later for the rest of her things.) She didn't
              divorce him, she wanted to stay on his health insurance, which was
              a very generous plan, but they remained separated until his death.</p>
            <p>Interpersonal relations were her strong point. She had many
              friends, several of them life-long. She was a good friend, a great
              listener, and could keep confidences. Even when illnesses limited
              what she could do, she still helped others. For example she
              volunteered for years for a suicide prevention hot line. Even when
              she was in a nursing home and struggling with vascular dementia,
              residents on her floor selected her as their representative. And
              she conducted drawing classes.</p>
            <p>She wanted to be cremated. But surprised me with her request for
              what to do with he ashes. She knew I lived near the Appalachian
              Trail (a half hour drive from it) and have spent a lot of time on
              it. So she said "I've always wanted to go on the Appalachian
              Trail, but never was able to. You know it well. Pick a place that
              has a nice vista or one that's pretty and spread my ashes there.
              By that time I wasn't so spry myself, but I picked a glen I'm sure
              she would have liked, with lots of mountain laurel and
              rhododendron, and scattered her ashes there, at a spot from which
              you can see the trail, maybe 100 feet away. </p>
            <p>But if she had had a tombstone a fitting epitaph would be "She
              made art and friends all her life."</p>

            <p>It's easy to think of Anne and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/Wiki/Thompson-47217">Hank</a>
              as being complete opposites. He was a mathematical prodigy, but
              math was her bugaboo. She had great people skills. Perhaps
              unfairly, I think of him as having "social dyslexia" and often
              seeing things backwards. Sometimes I thought that if he saw a
              "little old lady" struggling with an attempted purse snatcher, he
              would sympathize with the poor teenager, who was being savagely
              attacked with an umbrella.</p>
            <p>He was closest in age to me (13 years older vs 17 years) and we
              often shared the same bedroom, but I knew him the least well.
              Partly because he was away to college; in the army in Washington
              state; living in Norwich, NY; in the air force in Germany,
              Pakistan or Maryland.</p>
            <p>And partly because I felt his wife bullied me, so I often avoided
              them. Her excuse was that my mother had over-protected me (true)
              and that I needed to be "toughened up" to be able to stand army
              life when I got drafted. I never bought that story. I'd had
              rheumatic fever as a kid and still had a murmur. I instantly
              flunked my physical when the doctor walked down the line and gave
              us a once-over glance and was 4-F, unfit for service. I believe
              she just picked on me for the fun of it.</p>
            <p>When Anne and I talked about Hank, she would almost always say,
              "He was such a sweet child." My earliest clear memories of him
              were when he had polio and was in a body cast for spinal
              scoliosis. -- miserable in the summer heat before a/c, with sweat
              rolling down his neck and disappearing beneath the cast. And
              later, of him working (w/o the cast) on his extensive stamp
              collection -- stamps spread out on a card table or dining-room
              table, stamp tongs, Scott's catalogue at hand, a <a href="https://www.stampboards.com/viewtopic.php?t=68090">Stanley
                Gibbons Color Guide</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation_gauge">perforation
                gauge</a>, an open bowl of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tetrachloride">carbon
                tetra-chloride</a> to detect watermarks filling the room with
              toxic, brain killing vapors and a towel for to place the
              carbon-tet soaked stamps on till they dried (which didn't take
              long).</p>
            <p>Before my time he went to a number of country schools in the
              Binghamton area. When they lived in The Town of Binghamton just
              south of the city in a neighborhood known officially as "Park
              Terrace Heights" (and informally as "Dog Hill") he formed a close
              friendship with two neighbors named 'Courtright,' and the three
              referred to themselves as "us twins."</p>
            <p>He had a remarkable brain. When a teacher presented a difficult
              math problem he'd often have the right answer immediately. But if
              the teacher asked what steps he'd gone through to get the answer,
              he often was out of luck and didn't get credit because he hadn't
              gone through any conscious steps&nbsp; -- the answer just popped
              into his head. Like a number of card players I've known, he could
              remember every trick, in every hand, in every game of bridge all
              night. Who had bid what. And who had played what. He would
              sometimes say "In the third hand of the fourth game tonight, when
              you got the lead you lead the __ of __. But you should have led
              ___." More remarkably he could play simultaneous games of chess --
              blindfolded. One of his hobbies was cryptography, which I suspect
              came in useful when he was in the Air Force, but assigned to NSA.
              I say "suspect" because he wasn't allowed to say much about what
              he did there.</p>
            <p>When he was going to Syracuse U., he would come home for holidays
              and breaks and bring homework. Some of his accounting courses had
              amazingly dull and pointless exercises. Just doing many, similar
              arithmetic problems for drill. Not teaching you anything -- just
              the same old problems done in grade schools for years, but with
              more digits in the numbers and more numbers in a column. Stuff
              that any accountant or bookkeeper would have done on an adding
              machine. Naturally they bored him to death. But they seemed like
              fun exercises to me because I wasn't used to working with so many
              digits on a page. So, I would do his accounting exercises for him
              while he was home.</p>
            <p>When he was gong to Syracuse U., one of the jobs he had was as a
              short-order cook, 3rd shift, at a greasy spoon lunch
              counter.&nbsp; They didn't get a lot of customers that late at
              night. Mostly regulars. The menu never changed, so he was annoyed
              by one of the regulars, would come in every night and say "What's
              new on the menu tonight?" One night, shortly before that customer
              was due, a bat got in the kitchen and they somehow killed it with
              brooms. Just before that customer came in and asked, "What's new
              on the menu tonight?" And was told "bat burgers." Thinking he was
              playing along with the joke, he answered "Fine, I'll have one of
              those." City health department and liability insurance not being
              then what they are now, Hank discretely dropped the bat in the
              deep fat fryer basket, and in a couple of minutes, put it in a
              large hamburger bun and served it. The customer took a bite,
              realized something was different than expected, opened the bun,
              put a napkin over his mouth and made a mad dash to the bathroom.
              Apparently neither the owner nor the health department was
              notified, so Hank didn't lose his job. But that customer never
              again asked "What's new."</p>
            <p>A couple of stories about Anne's practical jokes say more about
              her than him. She didn't play them often -- all the better to
              surprise. When she thought he's gone out for a night of poker and
              drinking, she liked to "<a href="https://www.instructables.com/Short-Sheet-Bed-Prank/">short
                sheet</a>" his bed. But the crowning achievement (from a
              practical joker's point of view) -- and also the meanest, was the
              way she sabotaged one of his big dates. There was a girl he'd been
              wanting to ask out for some time, but was hesitant to try.&nbsp;
              Finally he found the courage to ask her out and was ecstatic that
              she accepted. You need to know that he had major sinus problems.
              The was before the days of pocket Kleenex. He would go through six
              or more handkerchiefs per night, so he would stuff he pants and
              jacket pockets with them, using the ones in his pants pockets
              first. She waited till he had done that. When he left the room for
              a minute, she removed one of the handkerchiefs from his sports
              jacket pocket (knowing he'd use the handkerchiefs in his pants
              pockets first) and replaced it with a pair of her frilliest,
              laciest, underpants. Sure enough that first date went well --
              until, later in the evening, he reached into his jacket pocket for
              a handkerchief, and ...... No amount of explaining worked. "It's
              not what you think." "They're my sister's." "She's playing a joke
              on me." One relationship down in flames. </p>
            <p>All during WW2 he tried to enlist but was turned down by all the
              branches, including the Coast Guard. Nobody wanted someone with
              curvature of the spine, who had double hernia operations, who was
              color blind and couldn't see much with out his glasses and was
              post polio. Even at some of the peaks of the war, when they were
              desperate for manpower, he was turned down. Given that history,
              it's bizarre that he was drafted, when he had a job he liked, in
              what appears to have been one of the Broome Co. Draft Board's
              biggest screw ups. The Korean War was still active and the board
              had a significant quota to fill. But, rather than take younger,
              more fit candidates, they chose to fill all the slots, with guys
              who had been repeatedly passed over -- for sound reasons. They
              took a bunch of guys who had serious medical issues, but were
              about to turn 26 and become ineligible for the draft, and filled
              their quota entirely with them. Hank was the only one who made it
              through basic training. All the others were given medical
              discharges. I vaguely recall him being stationed in El Passo,
              because I remember that his chronic sinusitis cleared up in the
              higher altitude and low humidity. I have some of his letters from
              then packed away, in which he mentions a school he'd applied for.
              As I recall the army would send him there during his 2nd year of
              service -- but only if he would agree to extend his enlistment for
              one additional year. He took the deal and was sent to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site">Hanford
                works</a> in eastern WA, as part of a radar controlled
              anti-aircraft battery, protecting our plutonium production
              facilities from Soviet bombers. Regardless of whether his being
              stationed there deterred the Soviets from attacking it may have
              been a factor in his later getting bladder cancer although thyroid
              cancer was probably a bigger risk.</p>
            <p>But while stationed there, he met a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Army_Corps">WAC</a>,
              Sgt. <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Diehl-1359">Ellen
                Diehl</a>, who had a sharp mind and an even sharper tongue. They
              arranged some joint leave time and he brought her home to "meet
              the family." Dad was a tough audience to audition for. About the
              only female he approved of "marrying into the family," was my
              Cousin Dave's <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/McNitt-155">first
                wife</a>. I can't imagine anyone not liking Evelyn.</p>
            <p>Anne once told me a strange story about that visit. A story that
              Hank told her. Why he would tell it to her seems hard to
              understand. She thought he told her because he regarded it as
              "cute." As I remember it, Hank told Anne that before the visit he
              said to Ellen, "I'm anxious for you to meet my sister. She's dear
              to me and I love her very much." To which Ellen supposedly replied
              "In that case, I hate her." To me that sounds more like jealousy
              than "cuteness." Assuming that account of the conversation is
              reasonably accurate, I find it hard to imagine anyone thinking it
              was a good idea to tell it to your sister. (Unless they had social
              dyslexia.)</p>
            <p>During that visit, Ellen quickly sensed the rivalry between my
              mother and grandmother and tried to build an alliance with gram as
              a counterweight to whatever influence mom and Anne might have. I
              think with some success. After having a daughter in WA, their army
              time was up and they moved to Norwich , NY where he managed an
              Army &amp; Navy store. I don't remember the details (if I ever
              knew them), but the owner got into some kind of a mess (bad check
              maybe) and the store closed.</p>
            <p>Hank could never have passed the Air Force's physical, which was
              more rigorous than draftees, but because he had been out of the
              army for less than a year, didn't need one. He enlisted in the Air
              Force and was sent to training in Ithaca, NY on servicing data
              processing equipment, and moved there with his family. He put in
              17 years with the Air Force, which with his time in the Army
              enabled him to retire with 20 years credit. Most of that time was
              on assignment to NSA. Our parents were aging, so when he retired,
              he took a job with Xerox, servicing their copiers, living first in
              Susquehanna, PA and then in Great Bend, PA. After they died, he
              moved back to MD, reading and fishing. He had smoked for years,
              but found a way to quit that worked for him. </p>
            <p>COPD finally did him in. In one of our last conversations, he
              told me that he had regrets about not "living up to his

              gifts to have accomplished. But he made good use of them in one

            <p> If you've read the previous chapters you already have read a lot
              about me. There's no need to duplicate any of that here. But I've
              placed miscellaneous things here as the spirit moved.</p>
            <h4> Civil Rights Movement </h4>
            <p> I'm sure I would have gotten involved in the Civil Rights
              movement, one way or another. But my path resulted from
              conversations with a sort of neighbor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lewis_Moore">William
                L. Moore</a>. I forget how we first met, but he knew my
              siblings, perhaps from when they'd lived in Park Terrace Heights,
              adjoining Binghamton to the south, which is where he lived. He was
              a postal worker and took the bus to and from work. I lived about
              half way between the end of the bus line and his house. In warm
              weather I'd often be doing yard work when he came by. It was all
              uphill to his house, so if I waved, he'd be glad to take a break
              and enjoy a glass of cold lemonade. He was well read and had many
              interests, so there was lots to talk about, including his 1955
              book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lewis_Moore"><u>The
                  Mind In Chains: Autobiography of a Schizophrenic</u></a>. He
              thought the way shock treatments were done was pretty barbaric. A
              family friend of ours had recently had them and underwent major
              personality changes as a result, so I was interested in learning
              about it. I wouldn't call him a friend, we never socialized other
              than these chats, but we were friendly acquaintances and I think
              both enjoyed our chats.</p>
            <p>I was shocked when I read of his death as a civil rights martyr.
              My wife and I went to his memorial service and were impressed with
              the way the Rev. Woodward, a Unitarian-Universalist, dealt
              respectfully with Bill's atheist beliefs. When a local chapter of
              <a hewd="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Racial_Equality">CORE</a>
              formed and named itself the "William L. Moore Chapter" formed, we
              joined (as did Rev. Woodward). I won't bore you with all of the
              activities, just cover a couple highlights. I previously mentioned
              having to jump out of the way when someone deliberately drove a
              car into a picket line I was in. (No one was hurt, we all managed
              to jump in time.) That protest happened to involve a classmate I
              knew from college. He was from southern India and had dark skin.
              He'd applied for a job as cook at a local diner, and the owner
              took one look one look at his skin color was turned down -- a
              violation of NYS law. Leaders of our chapter talked to the owner,
              who was adamant. There was no way they were going to hire a
              "colored" cook. Eventually we ended the picketing and sit-in and
              helped file a complaint with the state Civil Rights Commission.<a
                aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#India" id="India-ref"></a></p>
            <p>My main activity with the Chapter involved being chair of their
              Housing committee. Binghamton had a small African-American
              community, most of them descendants of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad">underground
                railroad</a> escaped slaves, and having lived in the area for
              generations, has no discernible accent when calling on the phone.
              People would come to us for help after they'd made an appointment
              to see a house or apartment and were told, "Sorry it's just been
              rented (or sold)," but doubted the claim. We would arrange for two
              teams, a couple each, to test the situation. A black couple would
              schedule an appointment, and a white couple would schedule an
              appointment shortly after. The black couple would show up and be
              given the "It's just been rented/sold" story. And then the white
              couple would follow up and, miraculously, the apartment/house was
              magically available. (The woman who usually went with me as my
              wife actually was a "Mrs. Thompson.") When we confronted the
              landlord/agent sometimes they'd relent knowing they'd been caught
              red handed. Often they'd make an excuse, such as, "I'm not
              prejudice, but if I rent to them my other tenants will leave." We
              would negotiate with them, offer help, and try to resolve the
              problem. Sometimes we'd help file a complaint. Occasionally they
              would be a hard line segregationist and say, "OK then, I'll just
              take it off the market."</p>
            <p>While in CORE I met two especially memorable people, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Farmer">James
                Farmer, Jr.</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Peck_%28pacifist%29">James
                Peck</a>. Farmer was an inspirational presence, radiating calm
              confidence. He had a great achievement as a teenager, portrayed in
              the 2007 biographical drama, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Debaters#:%7E:text=The%20Great%20Debaters%20is%20a,1997%20issue%20of%20American%20Legacy.">
                <u>The Great Debaters</u></a>, which I strongly recommend
              watching. James Peck was a more tragic figure. He played a big
              part in the 1964 <a href="https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/freedom-summer">Freedom
                Summer</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Freedom-Rides">Freedom
                Rides</a>. In 1963, before going to the March on Washington for
              Jobs and Freedom, he came to our chapter and conducted a course on
              passive resistance and how to cover out heads for protection, if
              beaten by night sticks. Fortunately I never had to test the
              training. But it was inadequate to the viscous attacks he was
              subjected to in '64. (If you search his name on the Internet you
              will see lots of pictures of him bleeding and later bandaged.) I
              don't think he ever fully recovered. I met Farmer and Peck twice
              and got to chat with them both times. In my second meeting with
              Peck, he understandably seemed a bitter man.</p>
            <h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_for_Jobs_and_Freedom">1963
                March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom</a> </h4>
            <p>Two busloads went from our CORE chapter.We didn't know what to
              expect. In many ways, Washington, DC was still a "southern city"
              and segregated. As mentioned above, we were trained in passive
              resistance - not knowing what to expect from local police or from
              KKK counter demonstrators. As we approached the route of the
              march, it was comforting to see National Guardsmen lining the
              streets. Just a single line of them, but on both sides of the
              streets. (We didn't know that their rifles were loaded with
              blanks.) Some of them may have been KKK members, but their
              presence was comforting anyway. It made it seem less likely that
              KKK thugs would attack the marchers. It was well organized. The
              bus drivers knew just where to go and told us where to find them
              for our return. Volunteer "march marshals" helped direct everyone
              where to go -- which units were assembling where. We had a great
              vantage point, and could watch the marchers pass by, while waiting
              for our turn to join the march. Each unit carried banners
              identifying what organization they were with or what union local.
              I could hear the speeches via amplifiers mounted on light poles --
              and recognize many prominent figures at the front of their units:
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dubinsky">Dave
                Dubinsky</a> of the Garment Workers Union. And the UAW's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Reuther">Walter</a>
              and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_G._Reuther">Victor
                Reuther</a>. And on and on. Countless ministers, priests, rabbis
              and nuns from every faith group you can think of. The marchers
              move slowly because of congestion at the Mall. So we got to see
              many of the speakers and performers as we crept past the
              grandstand. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter,_Paul_and_Mary">Peter,
                Paul and Mary</a> performed for us. And I was thrilled to see
              and hear two of the days organizers whom I had long admired, the
              inspirational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayard_Rustin">Bayard
                Rustin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Philip_Randolph">A.
                Philip Randolph</a>. We were on the opposite side of the pool
              and out of sight of the speakers when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
              gave his largely impromptu "I have a Dream Speech," but someone
              had a portable radio we heard it on. Of course I knew of Dr. King
              from his involvement in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_bus_boycott">Montgomery
                Bus Boycott</a>. But I went home thinking that the great speech
              of the day, that would become famous, was the one Bayard Rustin
              gave. (That's not the first time I've been wrong.) I wanted to
              participate in the 50th anniversary of the March but had some kind
              of a conflict. I probably can't walk far enough to participate in
              future ones and am reluctant to do it in a wheelchair, but a
              multi-passenger golf cart might be OK.</p>
            <h4> Comnity Organizing and Community Service </h4>
            <p>I'm proud of my efforts at community organizing, but don't think
              of any stories that would interest you. I did quite a bit of
              community service including: serving on the Johnson City, NY
              Library Board and the Binghamton- Johnson City Joint Sewage Board
              (that may sound funny, but clean waters have always been important
              to me since my childhood memories of dodging floating feces while
              swimming in the Susquehanna River); Asst. Scoutmaster, chair of
              the Common Cause chapter for our Congressional District, NAACP,
              CORE and peace organizations. </p>

                  of Pythias</a> (but never participated in my time). My only
                interest in lodges was in beaver lodges -- those interested Tom
                too. He and Gret rented a lot on a lake and he liked to watch
                the industrious beavers come and go and add to their lodge.<a href="#Lodges-ref"

                subjective and lacking quantitative support. Similar
                accusations, perhaps with cause, were leveled at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung">Carl
                  Jung</a>. Funding may not be available, but I'm confident that
                if a large scale study was made, factor analysis would come up
                with similar categories -- even if not identical with Gardner's
                types. It's outside my field of competence, but my impression is
                that of the 3 founders of psychiatry, Freud, Jung and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler">Adler</a>,
                history has shown Adler's ideas to be closer to modern
                psychiatry. All three were medical men and "just armchair
                scientists."<a href="#IntelligenceTypes-ref" aria-label="Back to content">↵</a></p>

              <p>He was a somewhat tragic person. I remember in our freshman and
                sophomore years he would talk enthusiastically about how he
                would gain loads of knowledge in his studies and cound return to
                his rural village and help them enter the 20th century. But one
                day (I think in his junior year) he was on the brink of tears.
                My recollection is that he said something like "I can't go back.
                I wanted to help them. But I just can't face it. The dirt
                floors. The flies. The heat. I just can't." <a href="#Indiaf" aria-label="Back to content">↵</a></p>
