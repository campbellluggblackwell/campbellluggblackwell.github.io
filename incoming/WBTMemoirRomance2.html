            <p><i>[When your social ineptness leads to making a fool of
                yourself, that's one thing. In retrospect, you can look back on
                it and have a good laugh. But when it leads to needlessly
                hurting those you love, that's a very different story. A
                therapist once told me, "It's OK to feel guilty -- provided that
                it doesn't last for more than 5 minutes and leads to changing
                your behavior." I've had guilt feeling for more than 50 years
                for my screw-ups. It's too late to make amends to those I've
                wronged -- I think they're dead. But perhaps you can learn from
                my mistakes and get counseling when you find yourself in
                situations you don't know how to handle. Fortunately, I
                eventually did learn how to better communicate feelings and how
                to face difficult situations -- not just run away from them.]</i></p>
            <h4>Fair Damsels In Distress </h4>
            <p>Growing up on King Arthur and his knights and on Robin Hood (and
              Dumas' novels and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Geste">Beau
                  Geste</a></i>) predisposed me to a romantic view of life, and
              the assumption that damsels wanted, needed rescuing; that rescuing
              was the appropriate response; and that I had a duty to be a
              rescuer. </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, back on the ranch, my mother worked hard at
              inculcating a very different view -- that of girls as a danger.</p>
            <p>If preparation for life required imagining you were donning
              shining armor and hopping on a charger, sailing pirate infested
              seas, searching for King Solomon's mines, taking your covered
              wagon on the Oregon Trail, being king of the jungle, etc., I would
              have been well prepared. But for a tall, skinny, awkward, terribly
              shy kid who was comfortable wandering through woods and fields,
              but had few interpersonal skills and had spent much less time with
              people my own age than the vast majority of kids I was ill
              prepared. In spite of having acquired Boy Scouts' "be prepared"
              skills. </p>
            <p>Being a romantic in that sense is far different than dealing with
              teen age hormones. I never had a "birds and bees" conversation
              with my parents. Instead, my mother gave me a book that covered
              the basics, and used photographs of individual male and female
              dogs to enlighten me. I almost got into such a discussion with my
              father once. I functioned as his helper when he was doing handyman
              tasks, handing him tools and materials as requested. Once while
              doing some electrical work he asked me to hand him a female
              connector. Being a curious kid, I asked him "Why to they call them
              male and female?" There was a long pause. Finally he carefully
              answered, "For historical reasons."</p>
            <p>Strangely, mother would frequently warn me of the danger of being
              ensnared by feminine wiles. Even of the danger of being alone with
              a girl because she might then "cry rape." In which case I would be
              defenseless to salvage my reputation and ruined for life. Looking
              back, that seems weird, almost pathological. She even had our
              distant cousin, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Essex-404">Rev.
                Canon Essex</a>, give me his "Temptations of the Flesh" talk,
              which was illustrated by pointing to buttons on one's shirt. Each
              button representing a different level of temptation. And which
              were to be avoided outside of the bonds of marriage.</p>
            <p> Like most boys my age then, I went to Saturday matinees of movie
              serials. Mostly westerns, but with occasional others, such as <i>Bomba,
                Boy of the Jungle</i> thrown in for variety. We would boo if at
              the end the hero would kiss a girl before riding off into the
              sunset -- a good story ruined by "mush." We still thought of girls
              in relation to "dumb stuff" such as playing with dolls, pretend
              tea parties, etc. and not knowing how to throw a baseball. My best
              friend at the time, who I'll call 'Rachel,'<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"

                href="#Fictious"></a> was "the girl next door."<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"

                href="#NextDoor"></a> It was OK having her as a friend because
              she was a "tomboy" and could do all the things the rest of "the
              guys" did. We were close friends for years, spent a lot of time
              together, and some grownups assumed that we would marry someday. I
              suspect that was the inspiration for my mothers' worries. Rachel
              had three older sisters who had been our neighbors when I was
              born. Her siblings and my siblings had gone to high school
              together. Her eldest sister had been of romantic interest to my
              eldest brother. Likewise for her next eldest sister and my other
              brother. While Rachel was a year or two older than me. [BTW, I
              think Rachel's sisters and my brothers would all have been happier
              had they married each other than the spouses they eventually ended
              up with. I was extremely immature, so Rachel was better off with
              her spouse.] </p>
            <p>My mother was frightened of the possibility that Rachel and I
              might fall in love because: 1) she thought Rachel's mother's
              family had a history of mental health problems [in fact both
              Rachel's mother and my mother ended up with dementia]; &amp; 2) I
              think snobbery -- fine-tuned class-ism. Both Rachel's and my
              fathers were factory workers. But status was very important to my
              mother. She had come from "one of the best families" of her small
              town. And her various ancestors' arrivals in the 1600s added to
              her status feelings. Rachel's father was a cutter in a shoe
              factory. She saw that as a low skill job in a low status industry.
              Whereas my she considered my father a highly skilled tool and die
              maker -- sometimes with the job title, "model maker," for a
              company that pioneered (and still made) flight simulators. Much
              more prestigious. </p>
            <p>Jumping ahead -- A couple of years after finishing high school,
              Rachel moved to Washington, DC to study art at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corcoran_School_of_the_Arts_and_Design">Corcoran
                School</a>, but we kept in touch by writing and getting together
              when she visited her parents. I even visited her once there.</p>
            <p>In jr. high I had "puppy love" crushes on girls, but always as a
              secret admirer from afar. Letting a girl know I LIKED HER was
              unthinkable -- she might find it ludicrous. </p>
            <h4>Carol</h4>
            <p>All my activities were "guy" things, or solitary, like reading. I
              did one time get up the nerve to ask a blonde ex-neighbor, Carol,
              out on a date, but it was a disaster. We went to a matinee movie
              by bus. The bus part was OK because nobody in junior high drove.
              The movie was OK. One of the non-OK parts was taking her to a
              smelly, dirty greasy spoon, which I thought was a great place
              because you could get more hamburgers there for your money than
              anywhere else in town. I loved to go there after a movie, but it
              was easy to see she didn't share my taste in restaurants or cheap
              hamburgers. The nadir of the event was on the way home. Trying to
              recover lost ground, I handed her a cheap plastic woman's wallet I
              had found, explaining "I found this in the gutter on the way to
              your house and thought you might like it." She was speechless. In
              fact, I don't remember her ever speaking to me again.</p>
            <p>"Tom boy" Rachel and I spent lots of time together as good pals
              or best friends. But any romantic feelings were kept suppressed.
              Except for one time I recall when we were sitting side by side on
              a hillside and put my arm around her. As I recall, she snuggled up
              closer, and we sat there for a long time, enjoying the moment. But
              that was a "nonce," a one time thing. For one thing, I didn't want
              to risk losing her as a friend.</p>
            <p>It took two and a half years after taking Carol to the movie
              before I got up the nerve to ask another girl out. I felt I should
              go to the Junior Prom. Besides, I had already had dance lessons
              and never used them. There was a girl in the band that I had
              "liked" from afar for some time. Her brother was in scouts with me
              and I was their paperboy, so I knew her some. Of course "liking"
              her was a well kept secret. Somehow I managed to ask her to the
              Jr. Prom and miraculously she accepted. Everything went OK this
              time. I succeeded in keeping "liking" her a secret, so that was
              the end of that. Besides, she was a nice person, but there was no
              "magic" between us.</p>
            <h4>Dottie</h4>
            <p>Every year we received new locker assignments. In 12th grade,
              there were two girls with lockers next to mine, Mary Ann and her
              friend, Dottie. I was still very shy, but they struck up
              conversations. Gradually I was fairly comfortable talking to them.
              It was easier to talk to Mary Ann, who was very nice, but I
              thought of her as plain and somewhat overweight. Dottie seemed the
              prettiest girl I knew, with enormous,
              if-you-looked-too-hard-into-them-you-could-get-lost eyes (at least
              that's how a cheap detective story would describe them), so I was
              shyer with her. After a few months, one time when Mary Ann and I
              were alone at the lockers, she said, "Dottie really likes you, ask
              her out." "Gee, she's nice, but I don't know." The scene replayed
              3 or 4 more days, before I got up the nerve to ask Dottie out. I
              don't remember any of our early dates. But soon we were holding
              hands and even though I always hated getting wet, suddenly it
              didn't matter if it was raining or not.</p>
            <p>This was a great beginning of a relationship that was off and on
              for three years. There were many great things about the romance.
              Getting lessons on how to kiss. The high of falling head over
              heels in love. Developing a closeness that was different than that
              with my buddies. Dottie was petite, dark haired, artistic,
              unpretentious, open, loyal, and had many other admirable
              qualities. She loved me in spite of my shortcomings. (I like to
              think that she saw the person I had the potential to become.) We
              had a wonderful time just being together doing simple things,
              playing miniature golf, going to an occasional movie, or just
              going for a walk.</p>
            <p>I didn't have much money for dates or presents.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"

                href="#Finances"></a> But Dottie never gave any indication of
              minding and made the most of enjoying the simple pleasures of
              spending time together. </p>
            <p>Her mother died a couple of years previously and she lived with
              her father and step-mother. I never got to know them well. They
              moved away during our senior year and Dottie moved in with a
              friend's family. </p>
            <p> After graduation she took a job with NYS' first discount store,
              <a href="http://mytownagreatplacetolive.com/memories-philly-sales/">Philadelphia
                Sales</a>. She put her artistic talents to work making signs and
              posters for their sales. And arranging their window displays. The
              pay was too little to live on, so she moved to her older brother's
              home in New Milford, PA (abt. 25 mi. away) and commuted by
              Greyhound. Often I would meet her as she left work, walk her to
              the bus station (sometimes getting a bite to eat), buy a round
              trip ticket to New Milford so I could sit with her, holding hands,
              getting off the bus with her and walking her home -- then hurrying
              back to the bus stop to pick up their last return bus to
              Binghamton. It was usually around 10:30 when we got there so some
              of the family may have already been to bed. I only briefly met him
              once. Perhaps he didn't like me, thought I wasn't a suitable
              catch, or that I wasn't "doing right" by his sister. By the time I
              rode back from New Milford and walked home, I got to bed quite
              late. </p>
            <p>My family didn't approve of Dottie, I'm not sure why. Probably
              mom thought her socioeconomic status was beneath our family's.
              Dottie and my closest friend, the late Renny Boezi, didn't like
              each other either for some reason, and that discouraged double
              dating. One time I remember double dating with Dottie involved a
              girlfriend of hers whose date drove a small Porsche. I wasn't
              impressed by the car, but I liked sharing the tiny, very cozy back
              seat. :)</p>
            <p>We did double date with Renny for our Sr. Prom. He borrowed his
              father's Olds Rocket, we all went to his parents and my parents
              for pictures before the prom. We went somewhere for food
              afterward, then he dropped Dottie and me off at 208 where we sat
              by the fish/lily pond till dawn, talking, holding hands and being
              very happy. </p>
            <p>I was brought up with all sorts of propaganda about there being
              "good" girls, and "bad" girls. There were very severe limitations
              as to what you could do with a "good" girl without her losing that
              designation. If a transgressing couple quickly got married, that
              partially undid the curse. So in three years of intermittent
              "going steady," necking was all we did. Kissing, hugging, holding
              hands. I'm not sure what her druthers were, but I was very
              inhibited. Lots of hormones, but more inhibitions. Condoms were
              the main method for birth control then, and not very reliable. I
              figured that having sex was irresponsible unless you were in a
              position to get married should an accident occur.</p>
            <p>We dated most of the time during my college Freshman year. There
              were some breaks of a month or two when we didn't see each other.
              I don't remember if I did any dating during the gaps or not. I
              would have felt free to. She did come to some college dances that
              year, probably double dating with Renny for transportation. When I
              was a sophomore in college, Dottie enrolled in Johnson City's
              Practical Bible School (now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_College_%28New_York%29">Davis
                College</a>) and moved to a dorm. The students weren't supposed
              to go to dances or movies. That helped keep dates cheap, but
              seemed silly to me. I asked her some tactless, snobbish question,
              such as "Why did you sign up for this dumb school? I felt like the
              pompous ass jerk I was when she answered that she was afraid of
              falling too far behind me if I went to college and she didn't and
              this was the only one she could afford. What a colossal jerk I was
              not to realize she was doing it in an attempt to be "good enough"
              for me. I felt so petty and ashamed. </p>
            <p> She became interested in marriage. Several times as we walked
              past stores she would window shop and look at engagement rings or
              wedding dresses and comment on how pretty they were. </p>
            <p>One night our passions heated up. Nothing forbidden happened, but
              not from lack of desire. If I'd had my act together, I would have
              put my cards on the table and said, "I love you, but I'm won't be
              able to marry until I finish college and can get a good job. I'm
              finding it difficult to control my passion. I don't think I can do
              it for two more years. I don't see any alternative other than
              breaking up." But I wasn't skilled enough or wise enough for that.
              Instead, inexcusably, I cut the date short, took her back to the
              dorm, and fled. I never called her or wrote to her again. :( </p>
            <p>Running away from problems rarely works. I've never forgiven
              myself for mistreating her that way.&nbsp; We loved each other and
              probably she would have made a good wife if we could have found a
              way to wait till I graduated. Perhaps we could have made a good
              marriage, but I suspect I would have made a poor husband back
              then. I was very insecure. And manipulative. Nor had I yet escaped
              from the male privilege culture I was raised in. I "grew up" too
              slowly. It took me till about 35 before I was willing to "come out
              from my shell" and risk being vulnerable.</p>
            <h4>Nedra - "In the spring a young man's fancy ..."</h4>
            <p>In the spring of my junior year I found myself in a class with
              Nedra Henderson. It was a small college, so we'd had a nodding
              acquaintance since the beginning of my freshman year. But her
              interest was in dramatics, so we moved in different circles. But
              we quickly discovered that we both had the same next class, in a
              building off campus, in a park, that was a long walk along the
              river bank. And that just the two of us had that sequence from
              whatever the first class was to the second, lectures on Art
              History. We chatted a lot on those walks to and from the art
              lectures and became comfortable with each other. She was engaged
              to a math major I knew slightly. He was drafted and sent to
              Germany so she was lonely. And the spring days sent sap flowing to
              the trees buds and blood flowing in my veins. Somehow we found
              ourselves walking hand in hand. And kissing often. Our
              relationship flowered, along with the flora, and lasted into the
              early summer. </p>
            <p>This time I didn't break it off, nor was I the one who didn't
              know how to handle the break up. One day I called to set up our
              date for the coming weekend. Her mother answered the phone and
              said, "She can't see you this weekend, she's getting married." </p>
            <p>That was a surprise, to say the least. I knew the fellow she
              married. He was a creative writing major, very confident of his
              talent. But pissed at me for rejecting a story he submitted to the
              college lit. magazine when I was its editor. I may have been right
              about the merits of that story, but he was right about his talent.
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_E._Westlake">Don
                Westlake</a> became a great success, getting whole library
              shelves filled with his books -- three of which were made into
              movies.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#Westlake"></a></p>
            <p>It salved my ego to imagine that Don had "stolen" Nedra from me
              to get revenge, but that's unlikely. She was bright, sweet,
              talented, and animated. He offered her a move to NYC where she
              hoped to become an actress (she was good in our college plays).
              The marriage didn't last and she and her two children came back to
              the Triple cities where she opened up a great, huge used book
              store. We bumped into each other many times. The most surprising
              was after my sister had separated from her husband and moved into
              an apartment in Binghamton. Soon after when I visited, my sister
              said "I want you to meet my neighbor and new friend" and
              introduced me to -- <a href="https://www.pressconnects.com/obituaries/bps130647">Nedra</a>.
              We remained friends over the years, but lost touch when I moved
              from NYS and now she's gone.</p>
            <h4>Barbara</h4>
            <p>Out of respect for her privacy I don't intend to say much about
              her. We had known each other for years from church, but first
              dated when she was a HS senior and I was a college freshmen. We
              dated off and on until I was a college senior and we then "went
              steady," even though she was junior at <a href="https://www.newpaltz.edu/">SUNY
                New Paltz</a>. After I graduated, we became engaged and married
              soon after her graduation. Our marriage lasted 20 years and
              produced two fine sons. After we divorced, things were strained
              for a while, but now we get along fine.</p>
            <p>It may seem strange, but I almost proposed to Rachel instead of
              Barbara.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#Proposal"></a></p>
            <h4>The Js</h4>
            <p>It took several years for my divorce to become final. I had
              started my own business and was busy being a single parent, so I
              didn't date for a few years. But when I did, I made up for lost
              time. For a while, I was dating seven women at the same time (but
              only one at a time on my dates). Purely by consequence, all of
              them had names beginning with the letter 'J.' Jane, Janet, Janice,
              Joan, Jean and two others.</p>
            <p>They new that I was dating others, but I lived in terror that one
              of my sons would take a message and get the name wrong -- and that
              I would mistakenly return the call to the wrong 'J.' Somehow an
              'L' got into the mix and I might have married her, but didn't
              think she was ready for a commitment. I did a better job of being
              open and honest with 'L' about our breakup. I think I did a good
              job of breaking up with Jane, but our relationship had been rather
              platonic, so that may have made breaking up easier. </p>
            <h4> Mary </h4>
            <p>And then I got lucky and met Mary. If we'd met two years earlier,
              maybe even one year earlier, we wouldn't have been ready for each
              other. But at last, we'd gotten our acts together enough to be
              ready for a healthy relationship. We were both "comfortable in our
              own skins." We weren't looking for a complementary personality to
              "make us whole." Or to "take care of us. I don't think either of
              us was "looking," but rather was "open to possibilities."</p>
            <p>Mary joined a square dance class held by a square dance singles
              group, "Bachelors and Bachelorettes." In these classes they try to
              have an experienced dancer to help each beginner and her class
              needed more male square dancers with experience. I was dancing
              with a couple of clubs at that time, some of which had members who
              also were in Bachelors and Bachelorettes. So they prevailed upon
              me to come help their class. There were a lot of pleasant women in
              the class (by now I had outgrown putting a big emphasis on
              'attractive.' But one stood out immediately because of her warm,
              cheery, self-reliant personality. I was attracted to her
              immediately (a fact I like to attribute to pheromones).</p>
            <p>By the second night I asked her out for coffee after, but was
              still pretty nerdy. (E.g. wearing double knit polyester pants and
              perhaps a pocket protector. :) I didn't yet appeal to her, but I
              enjoyed holding her close in the "swing your partner" moments. I
              was 50 now, old enough to have the self-confidence to persist in
              asking her out. Finally she was comfortable enough with me to
              accept my invitation to go to Philadelphia and hear a female
              friend of mine play trombone in a band that played 1940s "swing"
              music and had a vocalist with a good local reputation. She found
              that intriguing enough to say yes. And had a good enough time to
              accept next week when I invited her to come to a local coffeehouse
              and hear blues singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Block">Rory
                Block</a>. By the end of that performance she was comfortable
              with my arm around her and my massaging her shoulders. And I knew
              I would be comfortable spending the rest of my life with her.</p>
            <p>I invited her to "meet the family" by having dinner at my home,
              then shared with my sister and my younger son who was away in
              college. My older son and his wife came. There was a slight bump
              in the road when Mary, who likes to ask questions as part of
              getting to know someone, asked my super private sister "So, what
              do you usually have for breakfast?" and was answered with an
              abrupt "That's none of your business!"</p>
            <p>After dinner, Mary offered to help my daughter-in-law with dishes
              -- provided I entertain them. I won her over by doing a soft shoe
              (in my Scottish Country dancing <a href="%20https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghillies_%28dance%29">ghillies</a>
              and reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Cummings">e.e.
                cummings</a> poetry to them. My sister put in a "plug" for me by
              telling Mary that I was "a rare find."</p>
            <p>One of the reasons our courtship worked and a good foundation for
              our relationship was established is that we were both comfortable
              with "who we were" that we presented our real selves to each
              other. None of the "best foot forward" trying to make a good (but
              false) impression.<img src="Bill%20and%20Mary%20outdoor%20photo%202015.jpg"

                alt="2015 photo of Bill and Mary" style="width:30%;"> It was
              "what you see is what you get." We liked what we saw and are still
              together 34 years later. There were bumps along the road, but our
              love has grown and deepened through the years. I believe that part
              of the success of our marriage is that we respect and appreciate
              each other, in spite of our flaws. It also helped that we'd both
              been divorced once and didn't want to go through that again. We
              were willing to do the hard work needed to make a marriage last.
              For me, it's been better than I ever dreamed was possible.</p>
            <p>And if you want to get to know Mary better or see how the
              marriage has been for her, her memoir is available in bookstores
              or via Amazon.</p>

            <li id="Finances">I didn't have much money for dates or presents. In
              our first year, 12th grade, the money I had was from my paper
              route. You made 1.6 cents a day on each paper Monday thru Saturday
              and 3.6 cents per paper on Saturday. There were usually around 110
              customer, so that came to a total of $16.28 a week if you could
              collect it. Sometimes people moved owing several weeks or claimed
              they didn't get a paper on a particular day and didn't pay. I had
              to hire a helper to deliver papers on the nights we had marching
              band practice and every Sunday morning, when they were too heavy
              to carry by myself, so my weekly income averaged under $10 The
              minimum wage at the time was $.75/hr. ($7.77 in 2022 dollars) so
              that gives you some perspective on what money was worth. In
              college, my finances were even worse. My parents gave me an
              allowance of $10 dollars a week, but I usually paid about $6 in
              gas money to other students I got rides to and from college with.
              My lunches and incidental expenses came out of that $4.</li>

            <li id="Proposal">I'd completed college and now had a good job.
              According to the prevailing life script of those days it was now
              time to get married. But to whom? I approached it very
              methodically, taking a yellow, 8.5 x 14 inch legal pad and
              dividing it into two columns --- Plus and minus. Rachel had come
              home for a weekend visit to her parents and she and I went to see
              the newly released movie, <i>The King and I</i>. We enjoyed it
              and had a great time -- but just as friends. I felt my
              relationship with Barbara was going nowhere and decided to break
              it off. I filled out a sheet on the yellow pad rating Rachel and
              her pluses way outnumbered her minuses. Accompanied by two
              friends, I went on a two week trip to Maine -- climbing Mt.
              Katahdin and canoe camping on Grand Lake. It was a great trip, and
              while doing mountaineering, I gave a lot of thought to Rachel. I
              had never allowed myself to love her, but we got along so well
              that I was confident that I would quickly come to love her once I
              allowed it. It didn't hurt that she was smart, talented and very
              pretty. I wasn't sure, but suspected she would be interested.
              Passing through a town near Mt. Katahdin where I had told people
              they could reach me via the post office general delivery, I bit
              the bullet (or if you prefer, took the plunge) and wrote and
              mailed a post card to Rachel saying simply "Shall we dance?" I
              checked with the general delivery window, and to my surprise there
              was a letter to me from Barbara. She wrote that my risking death
              on that mountain (I did have two very close calls) made her
              realize how much she loved me and needed me.) When I returned home
              there was no reply from Rachel. Through a combination of cowardice
              (possible rejection if I pursued Rachel) and a knight's duty to a
              damsel in distress, and substituting <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shank%27s%20mare">shanks
                mare</a> for a white charger, resumed the relationship with
              Barbara. Neither Rachel nor I ever brought up the post card when
              we met or wrote.</li>
