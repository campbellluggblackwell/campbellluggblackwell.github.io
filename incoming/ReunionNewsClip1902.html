          <p>The annual reunion of the Campbell and Hazlett families was held in
            Nelson, Aug. 14th. The day was a perfect one. About 1 o'clock the
            people were seated. Rev. John Davies returned thanks and the dinner
            was served. There was an abundance of good things to eat, good
            music, good speaking and good will every where. Although the
            attendance was not as great as last year, every one agreed that it
            was a most enjoyable day. There were some new faces among them, and
            five of those who were with us last year have joined the great
            reunion on the other side. They are <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Knapp-4325">Mrs.

            President; J. D. Campbell, Secretary; M. B. Seely, Treasurer. It is
            sincerely hoped that many of those who were absent will meet with us
            next year. Layfayette Roundsville of West Bay City, Mich., an old
            friend of the Campbell family, is visiting friends in this vicinity.
            He made and received a hearty welcome from all. C. H. Congdon made a
            pleasant addition to our number this year. The venerable Dr. A. M.
            Loop<sup>2</sup> made a few remarks that touched the hearts of all
            who heard him.</p>

        <h3> FOOTNOTES: </h3>
        <div class="w3-container w3-cursive">
          <p> 1. Mabel SHIPMAN Shaw wrote the words. But the tune was that of a
            popular Civil War song, "Marching Through Georgia."</p>
          <p> 2. Dr. Albert Mortimer Loop (born 1818 in Elmira, NY; died 1904 in
            Nelson, PA) was Nelson's well liked doctor before his retirement. He
            also was an amateur historian who wrote the article on the history
            of Nelson Township in Munsell's "1883 History of Tioga county, PA."
            His nephew, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Loop-309">James
              William Loop</a>, married <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Campbell-31871">Maria
              CAMPBELL</a> Loop. Dr. Loop was twice appointed Nelson's
            postmaster and also was president of the Tioga County Medical
            Association and served on the committee for the county's centennial.
            The news clipping also mentions his 2nd wife, Sophia TREMAINE Loop,
            who had died in the last year.</p>
