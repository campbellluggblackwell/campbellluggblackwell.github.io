            <p><a name="WalterFThompson1893"></a> I see my father as
              complicated, but perhaps all people are complicated if you know
              them well. He had an unfortunate childhood that left him scarred.
              He was verbally abusive to my siblings and me, and took his razor
              strap to my older brothers, but "mellowed" with each child and
              became a loving grandfather. He lived in a world of simple, but
              rather rigid, distinctions. People were either "good" or "bad."
              One transgression by a friend of decades was unforgivable -- they
              were crossed off his list. </p>
            <p>A neighbor from Dublin used to say "He hangs his fiddle outside
              the door." I thin k meaning that he was convivial with his
              coworkers and fishing buddies, but distant from his family.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-1681">Walter
                Frederick Thompson</a>, Sr.,was born in 1893, in Plattsburgh, NY
              to a tubercular, immigrant <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47214">father</a>,
              who died when dad was two and had no memories of; and a nurse <a
                href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bulley-101">mother</a>, whom
              he didn't know well. When she was widowed with two young children,
              she left them in the capable hands of her <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/LaPlante-601">mother</a>,
              and moved to Williamsport, PA to work at the hospital she had
              graduated from, and to live with an older sister, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bulley-467">Mary
                Jane (Bulley)</a> LaBelle.</p>
            <p>Dad and his older brother, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47213">Maurice</a>
              were raised on a farm, by grandparents they loved. His grandmother
              was born in this country, to a French speaking family (they were
              near the border with Quebec). His grandfather, born Michel Boulé
              in Canada but reportedly renamed Mitchel Bulley by the Sergeant
              that mustered him into the Union Army. The family spoke French at
              home and attended a church with a French speaking priest who gave
              the homily in French. "Gram," as he called her, had 11 children of
              her own, and raised 3 grandchildren: dad, his brother, and their
              first cousin, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bulley-469">Harmon
                Bulley</a>, who was 7 years younger. Those were reasonably happy
              years, altho his immigrant grandfather (who had had been wounded
              in three battles, survived two Confederate POW camps and had a
              wooden leg) was quite strict. But he felt loved. However, when dad
              was about twelve, his mother married a doctor, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Burnley-143">George
                C. Burnley</a>, and dad &amp; Maurice joined their mother and
              step-father, who had just moved to a home in Nelson, PA.</p>
            <p> That was not a happy home. According to my father, their new
              step-father was an alcoholic who beat both boys and their mother
              when he was drunk. He and Maurice never forgave their mother for
              taking them from their grandparents. After four years she died.
              But before that, he and his brother had been practicing boxing so
              that one day they could defend themselves. I think when he was
              about 14 and Maurice was 15, their stepfather started to beat
              them, but they successfully fought back, beat him up, and ran away
              from home. But not before he met my mother.</p>
            <pa>The two brothers wandered around, together, for a while, doing
              odd jobs, including a stint as janitors in a bordello. (I heard
              that from my mother. He would never have mentioned such things to
              me or my siblings.) Eventually they made their way to
              Williamsport, to the home of his aunt and her husband, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/LaBelle-1695">Leonidas
                Ovide LaBelle</a>, who was a machinist and apparently taught dad
              the basics of the trade. I didn't know any of this when I was
              growing up, just that dad and his LaBelle cousins were close. They
              often visited us, and we them, and we once took a vacation with
              one and his family. As I mentioned, dad and Maurice never forgave
              their mother, and refused to put a marker on her grave.</pa>
            <p>At the time, local school districts only had to provide education
              to 8th grade. That was the end of dad's formal education, but he
              was an avid reader and knew history quite well.</p>
            <p> When he was old enough, he joined the navy, and became a
              machinist on board a primitive submarine of the day. The US Navy's
              experimental designs of the K-series </p>
            <figure><img src="K1Sub.png" alt="Photo of US Navy K-series, pre WW1 subs"
                style="width:25%;">Pre-WW1 US Navy K-series sub.</figure>
            of subs were more dangerous to their crews than to enemy ships. The
            K-subs didn't see combat, but were used for patrolling coasts.
            <p></p>
            <p>We no longer have a photo of his boat (subs are 'boats,' not
              'ships'), but I think heserved on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_K-5_%28SS-36%29">K-5</a>.
              They were used primarily for the Navy to figure out submarine
              tactics. I know he was stationed in Pensacola, FL. He used one
              leave to make a visit to Nelson, as a suitor. He apparently made a
              dashing figure in his uniform - enhanced by playing a mandolin.
              [He didn't "swear like a sailor." The only times I heard him swear
              was when hanging wall paper. Usually he relied on phrases such as
              "dagnabbit," "fiddlesticks," "hell's bells," or "Jehoshaphat's
              ghost."] </p>
            <p>He was injured when an explosion (or fire) happened in the engine
              room and he took a discharge well before WW1 broke out. They
              married in 1916, after mom finished her 3rd year at Mansfield
              Normal School (which was all that was required for secondary
              school certification).</p>
            <p>He set some good examples for us: honesty, hard work, civic
              responsibility and the value of craftsmanship. I don't remember
              him ever saying it, but he clearly believed that children were to
              be seen, but not heard. His factory shift worked from 6 AM to 3
              PM, so he would go to bed early. And thump on the bedroom floor
              with a shoe if we were noisy. If that didn't quiet us long enough,
              he would wrap himself in a blanket (he didn't wear pajamas), come
              down the stairs far enough to be visible and GLARE. He had no need
              to say anything. And his glares were more eloquent than anything
              he could have said. He has a special one for every occasion.</p>
            <p>He had a stoic outlook and admired the Spartan boy's stoicism.</p>
            <blockquote> One of the most famous stories of Spartan discipline
              was about a boy who found a fox cub, which he planned to eat. When
              he saw his instructor approaching, the boy hid the fox inside his
              garment to avoid being caught. As the instructor questioned the
              boy, the fox began to claw and bite within the folds of the boy's
              tunic, yet the boy did not cry out. According to the legend, it
              was only when the boy fell dead to the ground with his stomach
              bitten through that the instructor realized what had happened. </blockquote>
            <p> (That's not my idea of behavior to emulate.) </p>
            <p> He raised us on maxims I can still hear, echoing around in my
              brain.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>"Better to be thought a fool than to speak up and remove all
                doubt."</li>
              <li>"You get what you pay for."</li>
              <li>"Say what you mean &amp; mean what you say."</li>
              <li>"A place for everything and everything in its place."</li>
              <li>Bragging was a no-no. "Don't toot your own horn." And feeling
                sorry for yourself was a no-no too.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> If we said "That's not what I meant to say, the inevitable
              response was "Then why did you say it?" And long before my time he
              would ridicule Tom in front of the whole family by referring to
              Tom as "That damned fool." He never struck me (only threatened
              to). As I mentioned earlier, he took his razor strap to my
              brothers and his leather slipper to spank my sister. My mother
              used her hair brush to spank me.</p>
            <p> He was something of a misogynist. When my mother would have a
              group of women over, that was a "hen party." And the attendees
              were "biddies" or "battle axes." But he also had pejoratives to
              describe males: "blowhard," "stuffed shirt," or in the case of my
              father-in-law - "weak sister." (That was for crying at his
              daughters' weddings, something he felt no "|real man" would do.)
              And gender neutral put-downs such as "holy roller." As you can
              see, he could be very judgemental.</p>
            <p>He wanted us to grow up with excellent grammar and good manners,
              especially table manners. Some what incongruously, in order to
              teach us not to put our elbows on the table, offending elbows were
              subject to being jabbed with his fork. </p>
            <p> <img src="LaFayetteSedan.png" alt="Photo of Nash LaFayette sedan, ca. 1937"
                style="width:20%; float:right;">He was industrious. An excellent
              vegetable gardener, diligent pruner of grapevines, berry bushes,
              shrubs, etc. Replaced a long, laid field-stone front walk with one
              where the field-stones were set in concrete, carefully prepared
              gravel underneath. Built a large, stone fireplace in the back yard
              for grilling for picnics -- it even a range top. He did home
              repairs of all sorts and was especially proud of his painting
              skills; - mowing the meadow with a scythe; spending hours on his
              hands and knees, hunting errant dandelions with an old table knife
              to remove their roots (a custom I continued). And of course, tools
              were cleaned and put away. "Take care of your tools and they'll
              take care of you." During WW2, when Detroit wasn't making cars,
              did a great job of keeping our family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaFayette_Motors">Nash
                LaFayette</a> running.</p>
            <p>He appreciated nature, but seemed to need a fishing pole or a gun
              in hand as an excuse to go for a walk. He would often take the
              family for a Sunday drive to see scenic views or when the fall
              colors were at their peak. Often my mother would pack a picnic
              lunch</p>
            <p>In politics, like all family members of Civil War veterans, he
              was a Republican. He had no use for Harry Truman, whom he
              considered "vulgar." He was comfortable with Republican
              "liberals," such as <a href="">Nelson Rockefeller</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Javits">Jacob
                Javits</a>. But he did finally bring himself to vote for a
              Democrat for mayor -- who happened to be the brother of a family
              friend. </p>
            <p>He had no patience with religiosity of politicians who "wrapped
              themselves in the flag." He derisively referred to them as "200%
              Americans." Speaking of religion, he believed in God and an
              afterlife (and Providence), and was a close friend of our
              minister, sang in the church choir (he had a good bass voice) and
              would say grace for occasions such as Thanksgiving, but he wasn't
              "churchy." I think he mostly went because that's just what one
              did. Theology or doctrinal points had no interest for him (nor for
              me).</p>
            <p>He loved music, and if possible, never missed a performance of
              "Saturday at the Met." He had no interest in dance, and not much
              in art.</p>
            <p>He wasn't good at managing money, it tended to burn a hole in his
              pocket and there was always a new fishing reel or rod that he
              coveted. </p>
            <p>Speaking of fishing, he enjoyed telling tall tales (or tails)
              about fishing. He didn't consider it lying, because the listener
              should have know better that to give credence to preposterous
              stories. (Nor did he consider omissions as lying. Only what you
              actually said counted.) Some of his tall tales were quite long (as
              were the fish that got away). One of the shorter ones was abut the
              fishermen out on a lake. <i>"They caught so many fish that the
                level of the lake went down so much that they ran aground and
                had to walk all the way to shore, carrying as much of the catch
                as they were able to."</i> (Inspired by such stories I once told
              one of my grandchildren, who liked to watch ducks and geese on a
              lake "It rained so much one day that the water level in the lake
              rose, leaving only the geese' heads still above water") An.yone
              who didn't recognize "whoppers" for what they were was "a damned
              fool." He did like "pulling people's leg" and had a dry, wry,
              sense of humor.</p>
            <p>His favorite jokes to tell had punch lines that listeners had to
              supply for themselves. E.g.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>"What's the difference between a cross-eyed
                hunter and a constipated owl?"<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cross-eyed hunter can't hit when he
                shoots."</i><br>
              The listener was on his/her own to figure it out.</p>
            <p>He was a perfectionist, who had high standards for everyone,
              himself included. Standards that were impossible for any child to
              meet. We became quite expert at interpreting his scowls and varied
              looks of disapproval. I hope his grandchildren encountered
              approval, but his children didn't. No matter how hard we tried,
              nothing we could do was ever "good enough."</p>
            <p>To his credit, he tried to teach me how to bowl, one of his
              favorite indoor activities. He showed uncharacteristic patients in
              showing me how to hold the ball, to walk with it, release it, etc.
              I vividly remember one occasion. I almost threw a strike. One pin
              wobbled a while, but stubbornly remained upright. After the pins
              had been reset, and I was preparing to throw my 1st ball, he
              carefully showed me how to position my hand and wrist -- just so.
              I observed carefully, tried hard to remember all the fine points,
              really concentrated in following his instructions -- and rolled a
              strike. I was elated and hoped for some sign of approval. But as I
              returned, all he said was "Now the next time, you need to hold
              your wrist more ..." Even throwing a strike wasn't good enough. :(
            </p>
            <p>But he could be supportive. Especially when it came to my efforts
              to free myself from my mother's over protectiveness. I had picked
              up a lot of wilderness skills in Boy Scouts and Explorer Scouts
              and was anxious to lead "expeditions" to the Adirondaks with
              myself and one or more classmates. He was always an ally on
              winning approval for such trips, and always was willing to
              chauffeur either the drop-off trip or the pick-up trip. Initially
              they were for one week, later for two. I was very emotionally
              immature, but my hiking, canoeing, camping, and navigating skills
              were advanced. The trips all went fine.</p>
            <p>He wasn't anti-social. He played board games and especially
              enjoyed playing cards -- hearts, pinochle (he was very good at
              that), canasta or other rummy games -- but not bridge. We would
              often play at home evenings. And on Friday or Saturday nights,
              they would get together with friends for two or three tables of
              whatever.</p>
            <p>He didn't like my mother trying new recipes. Often he would
              refuse to try the dish. He would pointedly leave the table (often
              taking his dishes with him, making a bowl of bread and milk and
              either eating it in the kitchen, standing up, or sometimes, bring
              the bowl back to the dining room table and eat it there.</p>
            <p>He was very supportive of my sister when her first husband would
              misbehave. She (and her son) were always welcomed back, to stay as
              long as needed. He made it very clear to his son-in-law that
              anything he did-unto-her would be done-unto-him -- with interest.
              No one considered those warnings as empty threats. He never
              begrudged those "refugee" visits. My parents had opposed the
              marriage. One night my parents, sister and I (the whole household
              at the time except for my grandmother, who I think had gone to
              bed, discussed her choice. My sister was 30, and I was an almost
              grown-up (I thought) 14. I defended my sister as being old enough
              to make her own decision on such an important issue. My father
              said, "Shut up and sit down or I'll knock you down." So I did. I
              don't know what else was said, but obviously she did marry him.</p>
            <p>Which brings me to his grand-parenting. I'm confident that I was
              a better father than he was, but he may have been a better
              grandfather than me. He didn't like his son-in-law (for cause),
              but didn't take that out on his grandson. However, he intensely
              disliked one daughter-in-law (also for cause) and took it out on
              his granddaughter (mostly by ignoring her). My mother took him to
              task. "Walter, you're not being fair." (Calling him 'Walter' was a
              sure sign of a lecture.) It's not your granddaughter's fault who
              her mother is. She's a victim, not a perpetrator. Stop being mean
              to her." And he did. He liked both grandchildren (and three more
              who came along later) and treated them with consideration and
              kindness. He did evolve.</p>
            <p>I mentioned in a previous chapter that he chewed tobacco, usually
              Five Brothers pipe tobacco. Sometimes he would light up a pipe of
              it, but usually he chewed it instead. Nicotine is a good
              herbicide, so in his war on dandelions, he often would target them
              when he spat. His aim was pretty good, especially when tossing
              popcorn or peanuts into the air above his head, tipping it back
              and catching the popcorn kernel or peanut in his mouth. (But not
              while chewing tobacco.)</p>
            <p>As he aged, he did not "go gentle into that dark night." He had a
              series of heart attacks, but did not want to follow the doctors'
              advice about changing his diet or being less active. "That's not
              living." (I couldn't understand at the time, but do now.) He
              didn't quite get his wish of "dying with his boots on." He had
              another serious heart attack but survived and was going to be
              discharged. I visited him at the hospital and planned to talk with
              a nurse about whether he would be discharged that day or the next.
              He was sitting in an easy-chair and we were chatting about his
              release, when suddenly he had convulsions and collapsed. I yelled
              "Nurse, nurse", but it was a massive coronary and he died before
              the staff could arrive -- even though they came running. He would
              not have wanted to survive as an incapacitated invalid -- he would
              have felt "a burden."</p>

            <p><a name="Mom"></a>Writing about my mother always fills me with
              trepidation. I see her as complex, and don't feel I understood her
              as well as I did my father. <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hoyt-211">Jessica
                (Hoyt)</a> Thompson, was born in the small town of Nelson, PA,
              (near Corning, NY) in 1892. She was the eldest of three daughters
              of Joseph DeForest Hoyt and Frances Viola Goodrich, but was "the
              apple of her father's eye." And according to her mother, very
              spoiled as a result.</p>
            <p>It was a small town, big enough to have a RR station, hotel,
              livery stable, two churches, a barber shop, post office and
              several small businesses, and served as a market place for the
              surrounding farms. Her great-grandparents were founders of the
              town, so she grew up in "one of the best families." Not wealthy,
              but active in he community and well respected. Her father was a
              farmer, who sometimes also operated a small store. Her maternal
              grandfather was the Methodist preacher and both her grandfathers
              were Civil War veterans and well respected. She was proud that she
              had multiple ancestors who were early settlers of the colonies,
              coming to MA, CT and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Amsterdam">New
                Amsterdam</a> in the early 1600s. And very proud of being a DAR
              member. (My dad's ancestors were early settlers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_France">New
                France</a>, coming with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_de_Champlain">Champlain</a>.)</p>
            <p>Perhaps because her family had been very involved in their
              community, we were brought up with a strong sense of community
              responsibility and civic engagement.</p>
            <p>Her rather idyllic childhood came to an abrupt end at the age of
              10, when the father she adored dropped dead at age 42. They lost
              the farm and she and her sisters and mother moved in with her
              maternal grandparents. But it was very cramped and four more
              mouths to feed was a strain on her retired grandparents income. As
              a result, she moved in with her father's sister, <a href="https:/www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hhoyt-3455">Inez
                (Hoyt)</a> Boller and her husband, (my namesake), <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Boller-100">Billy
                Boller</a>. Their two children had died very young, and they
              welcomed mom as if she was their child. Mom called Inez "Auntie."
              Inez was fond of all three of her nieces, but she and mom bonded.
              And Billy Boller was fond of her. My siblings and I had no living
              grandfathers and so we called him "Grampa Bill."</p>
            <p>She grew up on the Boller's farm, which in Inez' day was called
              "Rose Lawn Farm," but was weather beaten and in need of paint by
              the time I started visiting. We spent much of the summer there.
              Before my time, Tom had an ill-tempered pony there, named "Betty."
              (I assume that was her name when Grampa Bill bought her rather
              than being named after my mother's sister.) My siblings all had
              fond memories of "Auntie," but she died soon after I was born, so
              I had no memories of her. Mom loved the Bollers' sheep farm. Most
              of his income came from selling the lambs to a slaughter house
              each fall, but of course he also sold wool. And had a side job of
              a "milk route." He would get up before dawn each day, leave with
              his old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REO_Motor_Car_Company">Reo</a>
              stake bodied truck, and drive his assigned route, picking up the
              dairy farmers milk cans, taking them to a nearby condensary (a
              plant where raw milk was turned into condensed milk and canned).
              He would return the empty cans the next morning when he picked up
              that days milk.</p>
            <p>My visits there were invaluable for introducing me to what life
              was like in the 1800s. It had no electricity, no indoor plumbing,
              no central heating. On one side, in the yard next to the kitchen
              door and side porch, was a hand pumped well. The outhouse was on
              the opposite side of the house. Kerosene lamps provided the light
              at night. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potbelly_stove">pot
                bellied stove</a> provided the only heat. And kettles placed on
              top provided the hot water to pour in washtubs for Saturday night
              baths. Each bedroom had a wash stand, with a large bowl and
              pitcher for washing up in the morning. And a commode (cabinet to
              hold a chamber pot).<img src="Commode.png" alt="Photo of a combination washstand-commode (i.e. a cabinet to hold a chamber pot"
                style="width:20%; float:right;"> Crawling into a cold bed in an
              unheated bedroom in winter was nothing to look forward to so
              rectangular soap stones, with a handle, were heated on top of the
              stove and then used as bed and foot warmers. It made you
              appreciate modern conveniences. In summer, cooking was done on a
              two burner kerosene, table top stove. I especially remember the
              mattresses, which were stuffed with dried corn husks and made a
              lot of noise when you rolled over. Getting up on a cold winter
              morning, with the room temperature not much above freezing
              inspired getting dressed under the covers, as much as was
              practical. When I hear people waxing nostalgic about "the good old
              days," I think of what daily life was really like then. And of all
              the young children's graves in the cemetery. Lifespans then were
              not too different from now -- for those who lived to adulthood.</p>
            <p>One consequence of growing up on that farm was that she never
              wanted to have lamb or mutton again, and never cooked it for a
              meal. But she loved that farm and the memories it held for her.
              Wm. Boller left it to her when he died. She kept it for several
              years, but couldn't get out very often and reluctantly sold it.</p>
            <p>After graduating she went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansfield_University_of_Pennsylvania">Mansfield
                Normal School</a> and lived in a dorm. At that time, two years
              at a normal school was required for a certificate to teach primary
              grades (1 - 6) and a third year to teach secondary grades (7 -
              12). Mom got her primary certification, taught for a year in
              Nelson, returned to Mansfield for her secondary school
              certification, and in 1916 married the handsome ex-sailor who'd
              courted her with the mandolin. (NYS recognized PA certification,
              so she was able to teach there.)</p>
            <p>They first lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Winfield,_New_York">West
                Winfield, NY</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Brookfield,_New_York">North
                Brookfield</a>, but soon settled in the Binghamton area, where
              she usually taught is small, rural schools. Dad and his
              brother-in-law, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Walker-36158">Roy
                Walker</a>, who lived nearby, enjoyed fishing in <a href="https://thecolgatemaroonnews.com/14662/news/the-loomis-gang-and-the-ghost-of-wash-loomis/">Nine
                Mile Swamp</a> (as did their sons later).</p>
            <p>Mom returned to Auntie's in Nelson for the birth of her first two
              children, "<a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47215">Tom</a>"
              (Walter, Jr. in 1917) and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47216">Anne</a>
              in 1919. (Her mother was living and working in Elmira, NY then. <a
                href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47217">Hank</a> was
              born in Binghamton in 1922. (I was an "afterthought" much later.)</p>
            <p>Her sister <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hoyt-3419">Isabelle</a>
              graduated from Mansfield Normal School and taught Phys Ed in the
              Elmira area. I think Isabelle and her mother lived together before
              her marriage, but after Isabelle married in 1925, gram lived with
              her and husband Tom Field. Isabelle was childless and wanted to
              adopt me, but mom declined, which may have been fortunate for me
              because Isabelle died 2 years later from meningitis. And gram came
              to live with us.</p>
            <p>The Depression years were tough, with dad being unemployed or
              underemployed much of the time and Hank getting polio, but we
              survived (but moving often). WW2 brought relative prosperity, but
              mom gave up teaching when I was diagnosed with rheumatic fever.</p>
            <p>She was active in the community, teaching Sunday School, holding
              offices in the PTA and Presbyterian Women's Organization, the
              church choir (until she "lost her singing voice"), the somewhat
              prestigious Garden Club and and had been active in the Grange. She
              was active in several women's bridge clubs, painted and had great
              flower gardens. I always mistakenly thought she somehow managed to
              join the exclusive <a href="https://whichmuseum.com/museum/phelps-mansion-binghamton-11705">Monday
                Afternoon Club</a> -- that's what the sign still read. But
              apparently they had gone out of existence and she just belonged to
              a group that met there (perhaps the Garden Club). I do know that
              she attended regularly, whatever the group's name was.</p>
            <p>Her DAR membership meant a lot to her. I'm pleased that in 1939,
              when the DAR refused to let <a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/04/09/298760473/denied-a-stage-she-sang-for-a-nation">Marion
                Anderson use their concert hall</a>, she, like Eleanor
              Roosevelt, resigned in protest. </p>
            <p>In those days the country was awash in prejudice. The KKK openly
              held parades in most cities. Mayors and public officials often
              openly supported them. Racial stereotypes were ubiquitous: Rastus
              and Mandy jokes, black-face performers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jolson">Al
                Jolson</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minstrel_show">minstrel
                shows</a>. A common expression was "There's a Ni**er in the
              woodpile." Brazil nuts were called "Ni**er toes." Kids blithely
              counted "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeny,_meeny,_miny,_moe">Eeny
                meeny, miny moe</a>, catch a ni**er by the toe."</p>
            <p>So, in some ways she was very progressive for her times and
              happily supported Nelson Rockefeller. But she also believed in
              preserving our country's WASP (White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant)
              cultural traditions. Immigrants were welcome, but needed to be
              "Americanized" and assimilated to understand, appreciate, and
              embrace American values. And we, as descendants of the early
              colonists, had a special obligation to help "enlighten" the
              foreigners. The emphasis seemed to be on the benefits to them (and
              the country) of their adopting our values. As was typical for her
              generation, there seemed little awareness that their culture and
              traditions could enrich American culture and life. One story in
              particular illustrates the "mixed messages" of my childhood. The
              first African-American family (whom I'll call "The Smiths") was
              moving into our neighborhood. Some of the neighbors were very
              upset and wanted to oppose it, but mom was very supportive.
              However, her support, as I recall, was worded "I'd a lot rather
              have good Ni**ers like the Smiths as neighbors than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polack">Polacks</a>
              like [those who] live next to me now." (BTW, the Smiths moved in
              and resided without incident, but were not invited to neighbors'
              picnics.)</p>
            <p>She had cardiac issues all her life and in later years, severe
              rheumatoid arthritis (sometimes painting with brushes strapped to
              her hands) and later a series of stokes and dementia.</p>
            <p>Their marriage wasn't conflict free, they often fought and even
              went through a trial separation in the early 1940s.</p>
            <p>She was a worrier. Overprotective of me. Insisted on picked out
              my clothes almost until I graduated from college. Loving but
              inhibited and not demonstrative. She'd read a popular book on
              parenting that said you shouldn't pick up a crying child or you'd
              spoil them and felt duty bound to stifle her "maternal instincts."
              I don't recall either parent ever saying "I love you" or once I
              reached school age, ever hugging me.</p>
            <p>And I see her as "meddling" in her children's lives. I've already
              mentioned her opposition to my marrying Rachel or Dottie. And I
              believe she campaigned against my brothers "getting involved with"
              Rachel's sisters.&nbsp; And to my sister's first marriage. But
              she'd also weighed in against her earlier suitors. And was adamant
              when my brother considered divorce to protect his kids from abuse.
              In part that was practical -- "No court is going to grant custody
              to the father." (Which was probably true then.) But also as a
              matter of reputation -- "Divorce isn't what we do." She and I had
              a showdown about her countermanding my orders to my kids. "It's a
              grandmother's prerogative to spoil her grandchildren if she wants
              to." (I won that one.)</p>
            <p>She had some great recipes (most of which were closely guarded
              secrets). Her usual cuisine was traditional New England. Meat
              wasn't done if it hadn't fallen off the bone yet. But she was a
              skilled baker. Huckleberry tea cakes were her <i>crème de la
                crème</i>. But she made great creme puffs, eclairs and popovers.
              (I make good popovers too., but from a recipe on the flour box.)
              And she made very good pies, her chocolate pies especially are
              fondly remembered (but all her pies were good).</p>
            <p>She was extremely hospitable. Family friends who lived alone were
              always invited to our holiday meals. And anyone present as
              mealtime approached would be invited to stay to dinner even if
              that required a miracle of loaves and fishes to stretch what she
              had planned to serve in order to accommodate one more. She, and my
              sister both denied they took it seriously, but both liked to read
              guests <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasseography">tea
                leaves</a>. I recall many occasions in which my mother would
              begin doing a reading -- then suddenly become disturbed at what
              she saw, her facial expression would markedly change and she would
              quickly break off the reading, making some excuse such as the
              leaves had become rearranged. But they both believed they had
              "powers." My sister also read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmistry">palms</a>.
              One supernatural incident in particular comes to mind. They both
              were certain that at the moment Tom was injured they both woke up
              from frightening dreams and "knew" that something awful had
              happened. Of course it was weeks before they actually knew the
              details of when he was injured. A telegram did soon come from the
              War Department informing my parents that he had been injured and
              was in a hospital, but the specifics of what day and hour didn't
              come out until much later.</p>
            <p>Her sense of humor was very different from my father's and seemed
              that of the Victorian Age. She loved saying things like "I scream
              for ice cream; we all scream for ice cream." And "Railroad
              crossing, look out for the cars. Can you spell it without any
              cars?" Or "Beach, birch and maple, all begins with 'A.'"</p>
            <p>She especially liked to draw the following story, which you were
              invited to read aloud:</p>
            <blockquote> A B C D <img src="Fish.png" alt="Goldfish sillouette"
                style="width: 47px; height: 24px; float:none;"> ?<br>
              L M NO <img src="Fish.png" alt="Goldfish sillouette" style="width: 47px; height: 24px; float:none;"><br>
              S M R<br>
              C M ? </blockquote>
            <p> See footnote for the "correct" answer. If the "solution" seems
              pretty dumb, perhaps that proves that you're not a Victorian :)</p>
            <p> If you're up for one more sample of Victorian humor and their
              proclivity to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism">euphemisms</a>,
              see.</p>
            <p>One of the scars that I think the Victorian mindset inflicted on
              families was the tradition that family skeletons must be hidden
              away in well locked closets. Put out of sight and out of mind.
              Some of this may be tied in with&nbsp; a sense of shame and fear
              of damaging the family's reputation in the community. But these
              things are all part of life. And everyone's family has experienced
              one or more of them. A relative committed a crime or was raped.
              (My uncle Maurice accidentally killed a neighbor.) Or had a child
              out of wedlock. Or had mental illness. Or was addicted to alcohol,
              drugs, gambling or whatever. My father wouldn't talk about his <a
                href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bulley-28">Uncle Kearney</a>
              -- didn't even want his name spoken in the house -- I don't know
              why, nor did any of Kearney's grandchildren have a clue what that
              was all about.</p>
            <p> Not in connection to Kearney I've read in the papers about one
              adulterous cousin who was involved in a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/m%C3%A9nage_%C3%A0_trois">ménage
                à trois</a> that resulted in a trial and newspapers' field day.
              The rational given for secrecy is often to protect children, but
              as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemony_Snicket">Lemony
                Snicket</a> and <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/magination/4416428">Margaret
                Holmes</a> have shown, that may not always be the best way to
              protect children. </p>
            <p>Both of my parents enjoyed antiques. They would shop at dealers
              and flea markets, buy pieces they liked. Dad would refinish them
              if needed. If chair seats needed re-caning or their splint or reed
              seats replaced, they would usually pay to have that done. If the
              piece didn't have beautiful wood, dad would often paint it black
              and mom would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stencil">stencil</a>
              it, often in guild. Sometimes the refinishing would remove some <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patina">patina</a> and
              decrease the piece' value as an antique, but the result was always
              a handsome piece of furniture. Mom collected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry_glass">cranberry
                glass</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_and_Sandwich_Glass_Company">Sandwich

          <p><a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47215">My elder
              brother</a> was my hero. He was kind and considerate to me. (I
            already mentioned his taking me for walks in his Adirondak
            pack-basket when I was a toddler.) I can't count all the things he
            introduced me to: puns, camping, poetry, Tolkien, folk music, how to
            identify sassafras and when to harvest it, and countless more. I
            couldn't wait till I was old enough to follow in his Adirondack
            paddling and hiking "footsteps."&nbsp; I was "Billy" to everyone
            else, but he always referred to me as "Willie" when I was a kid. He
            enlisted in the Army when I was a first grader, but always sent me
            things which I cherished -- rattlesnake rattles from the Mohave
            desert. A Navajo thunder-bird ring. Sea shells from the Pacific,
            etc. His letters home included "Tell Willie ..."</p>
          <p> He was superbly trained by the army. They sent him to the Mojave
            Desert to train for North Africa, but by the time he was finished
            they didn't need him in Africa anymore, so they sent him to Mt.
            Rainier, to train for fighting in Italy's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apennine_Mountains">Appenine
              Mts.</a> But by the time he graduated from that training they
            decided they needed him in the Pacific, and sent him to Hawaii for
            more training. Because he was taller than average, he was assigned
            to carrying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle">BAR</a>
            (a light machine gun usually fired prone supported by a bipod (a two
            legged support), but carried via a shoulder strap and capable of
            firing from the hip as you walked. He first saw action in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea">Papua
              New Guinea</a>, where he came to know and like a village of head
            hunters. "They're nice fellows as long as you stay on their good
            side." The Japanese committed atrocities and hadn't stayed on their
            good side, so the locals were glad to help guide the GIs.</p>
          <p>After that fighting was over, he was sent to northern Australia for
            R&amp;R, and then to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindanao">Mindanao</a>,
            for more combat. And finally to Luzon, where his mountaineering
            training was put to use as the allies moved toward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baguio">Baguio</a>.
            His unit held a ridge in the mountains, protecting an Army
            Engineering crew building a road to Baguio for the advancing army.
            After weeks of being ahead of their supplies and having to live off
            of rice taken from the knapsacks of Japanese soldiers they'd killed,
            his company came under an intense artillery barrage and suffered 70%
            casualties in a half an hour. He had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_guilt">survivors'
              guilt</a> because he saw his best buddy disintegrate from an
            exploding shell. Tom was badly wounded, losing the use of one lung
            and carrying countless pieces of shrapnel (they would work their way
            out for decades). But he was sure that he would not have survived
            had his buddy, who was between Tom and the explosion, not absorbed
            the worst of the blast. While in a field hospital for months, he
            contracted malaria, which would flare up repeatedly over the next
            several years.</p>
          <p>To understand Tom, you need to know that he turned down repeated
            attempts to promotion to sergeant and remained a corporal. "I didn't
            want to order men to their death." Eventually he was moved to
            hospitals in San Francisco and DC, before recovering enough to be
            discharged. After getting his Purple Heart and other medals, he was
            offered disability, but declined. "I can still work."</p>
          <p>But like every combat veteran from WW2, Korea and Vietnam that I've
            known, he suffered from PTSD for the rest of his life. (In WW1 they
            called it "shell shock" and "battle fatigue" in WW2. But "real men"
            were supposed to be able to tough it out and not need help. Of
            course back then it wasn't well understood and the meager help
            available often wasn't much help.)</p>
          <p>Before he enlisted, he's met Anna Gretna Walker, sister of a close
            friend of his. Additionally, she was a friend and coworker of my
            sister. He and Gretna corresponded through is army years and married
            as soon as he was well enough. He went to Triple Cities College in
            Binghamton on the GI Bill (one of the best investments the US
            government has ever made) and got a BA in botany. Then, loving
            history, he attended the NYS College for Teachers in Albany, for an
            MS to teach HS history. But, discovering he didn't like his student
            teaching experience, upon graduation, took a job as an electronics
            technician at Link Aviation, where my father worked. He later
            transferred to their "Contracts" department where he negotiated with
            NASA and the DOD about contract specification details. (I didn't
            come on my versatility and ability to take on jobs with zero
            experience by pure chance.) I didn't get to see him much during his
            college years, he was pretty busy. But we always felt "connected."</p>
          <p>The second major trauma in his life was the death of twin sons when
            they were only a couple of days old. He wouldn't consider counseling
            and I think he was deeply scarred the rest of his life. He would
            visibly flinch when he encountered boys the age they would have
            been. And for a long time avoided my sons. Mom tried to encourage
            him and Gret to adopt, but he refused to consider it. He came back
            from the war still believing in God, but couldn't forgive him for
            allowing the carnage of WW2. He never again went in a church, except
            for weddings and funerals.</p>
          <p>For a while he had a cabin cruiser, based near Ithaca. But he spent
            many hours canoeing and many more in boats on lakes and rivers of
            all sizes, which is why he probably developed a melanoma on a leg
            that wasn't discovered until it had metastasized. That was in the
            days before the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/affordable-care-act/">ACA</a>
            when insurance companies controlled most of the health care calls,
            and while he was getting radiation treatment for his cancer, his
            insurance company announced, "Sorry, you've reached your lifetime
            cap,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#LifetimeCap" id="LifetimeCap-ref"></a>
            no more health insurance coverage for you. </p>
          <p>Speaking of funerals, there's a "small world" story about his
            funeral. After he was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer, a
            neighbor asked permission to tell the pastor of his nearby church.
            The pastor, whose church was just a few blocks away, on the same
            street, did visit. He was from the Philippines. At the time Tom was
            wounded, the pastor was a boy, hiding in the jungle, a few miles
            from Baguio, so they had a lot to talk about. The visits continued
            and they became friends. That pastor was invited to do a scripture
            reading at Tom's funeral. His presence was a big surprise to Tom's
            nephew's wife. He had been her youth pastor when growing up in
            Clarke Summit, PA. "It's a small world after all."</p>
          <p>Tom was multi-faceted. He was an excellent photographer, especially
            of blossoms. He had a sharpshooter medal from the army and
            participated in many target shooting meets, I think becoming a NYS
            champion. He was a talented wood carver. He hunted, fished, hiked,
            and canoed. He liked minerals, picking up specimens of semi-precious
            gemstones such as garnets and many "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herkimer_diamond">Herkimer
              diamonds</a>." He filled 3 walls of his basement with a model
            train layout with bridges and tunnels that accommodated several
            trains simultaneously. He spent countless hours building RR cars for
            the trains, buildings, trees, shrubs, etc. He was very active in the
            Masons,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#Lodges" id="Lodges-ref"></a>
            both in his local lodge, but also statewide, popular because he had
            memorized so many of their rituals that had to be recited at various
            ceremonies. He would delve deeply into a hobby for several years,
            then put it aside and move on to new territory. He had a fine
            collection of antique glass and continued adding to that. </p>
          <p>Fishing remained a constant. He and Hank both went through periods
            of serious creators of trout flies and Hank made larger pieces, such
            as a "mouse" lure for bass. Dad and Hank continued to be avid trout
            fishermen, but all also did boat fishing for bass and Northern pike.
            Dad also liked to catch perch for eating. Both Dad and Tom would fly
            to remote areas in Quebec and northern Ontario in one of Link's
            planes and company pilots, a free benefit offered&nbsp; "old hands."
          </p>
          <p style="">I live just south of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocono_Mountains">Poconos</a>
            (they're more like hills than mountains, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmia_latifolia">mountain
              laurel</a> country). He loved photographing them (and dogwood
            blossoms), so each spring, when I saw that they were blooming, I
            would give him a "heads-up" phone call. For years after he died,
            when I would see their blossoms come out I would automatically think
            "I've got to alert Tom" -- and then feel sad when I remembered there
            was no need to call him. When he was a botany major, he impressed
            his professors with photographs he took through a microscope of
            single celled plants and had a talent for dyeing portions of a cell
            to provide better contrast. In later years he often used high
            magnification camera lenses to shoot tiny blossoms, barely visible
            to the naked eye, or close ups of lichens. For years he had his own
            darkroom where he developed and printed his photographs. I still
            have albums of his Adirondak hiking and canoe trips. And a small
            hard bound book he used when writing poems, short stories or verbal
            sketches. He liked capturing legends of Navajo and Pacific
            Islanders.</p>
          <p> When it became clear that he only had weeks left to live, I wrote
            him a letter, outlining how much he'd meant to me. I'm very glad I
            did that -- it meant a lot to him. When it became clear that he only
            had days left, I went up to Binghamton for a final visit -- staying
            at my sister's apartment. There already were blizzard warnings
            before I left her apartment to go to his home to say goodbye. I had
            the car radio on and when I was less than halfway there I heard the
            announcement that the sheriff had declared a state of emergency and
            closed the roads. I figured that it was now or never -- that if I
            turned around he'd be dead before the roads were reopened, and so I
            pressed on. Mine was the only car on the road. Main St. in Johnson
            City was NY17C -- two lanes each direction, with two lanes for
            parking. It was hard to see because it was snowing so hard. So I
            drove down the middle of the street (blinkers on), with the driver's
            window open so that I could scrape the windshield with one hand as I
            drove. Somehow I made it to his house and we said our goodbyes. I
            was glad I'd come, but the return trip to my sister's was some of
            the most challenging I'd ever done -- what with how hard it was
            snowing and how much had accumulated. But I'd grown up driving in
            NYS winter conditions, and made it back to my sister's OK and
            without being arrested. (I was always prepared for getting stuck in
            the snow. I had a sleeping bag in the car, so I wouldn't freeze. A
            shovel to dig out of a drift. Reflectors and flares to set out to
            reduce the chances of being hit. Etc.) He died the next day. It was
            3 days before the state of emergency was lifted, so if I had turned
            around there would not have been another opportunity.</p>

          </div>
          <p> I've previously mentioned that my siblings often seemed more like
            uncles and aunt. But my <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47216">sister</a>
            at times seemed almost like a second mother. And she was the one I
            felt safest sharing confidences with. (And with whom I may have set
            a record for the most times helping someone else move (and rearrange
            furniture). [I think she was only partially kidding when she said
            she was frustrated with an apartment she had on Binghamton's Park
            Terrace Pl. because she couldn't rearrange where the fireplace was
            located. :) ]</p>
          <p>I spent many hours with her gardening -- especially on a rock
            garden near a small lily pond dad built. And countless hours in
            walks through woods and fields, where she taught me how to identify
            wildflowers. (And occasionally steal some for transplanting.)</p>
          <p>I suspect that being a girl shielded her from much of the verbal
            abuse Tom was subjected to. But she may have been subjected more to
            the tugs and currents of the rivalry between mom and gram.</p>
          <p>She had strong people skills and many strengths: talent in art,
            embroidery, poetry, etc., but lacked self-confidence in some areas.
            Part of that was because of an injury she suffered as a teen where
            she broke her nose. It was rebuilt, but was not "A Thompson nose."
            Probably that was all for the better, but she was self-conscious
            about it. She was dyslexic, which may have been why she never
            graduated from high school. (She always felt self-conscious about
            that.) Instead she completed <a href="https://www.univstats.com/colleges/ridley-lowell-business-and-technical-institute-binghamton/">Ridley-Lowell
              Business School</a>'s secretarial training where she learned
            typing, shorthand, filing, etc. It definitely was why she never got
            t drivers license. </p>
          <p>I believe there are many different types of intelligence,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
              href="#IntelligenceTypes" id="IntelligenceTypes-ref"></a> but hers
            were markedly different from the rest of the family, which sometimes
            led to feelings of inadequacy.</p>
          <p>She had a strong sense of fashion, and as a teenager filled
            notebooks with fashion sketches. She worked in clay, water color,
            oils, charcoal and loved pastels. Being a "Sunday painter" ("a
            nonprofessional painter, usually unschooled and generally painting
            during spare time") was an important source of satisfaction to her.
            I'm not sure about the "unschooled" part. I know she took night
            school courses from two of Binghamton's best water-colorists. And
            she studied painting in oils from Binghamton's most prominent
            portrait painter. I believe there was more training, but I'm not
            sure of the details. She was also active in the arts and crafts
            scene, having her own candle making studio, roadside stand and
            participating in arts and crafts shows. Perhaps the Met wouldn't
            have bought any of her works, but I think many had considerable
            appeal and merit. If she ever tried to sell any of her art, I'm not
            aware of it.</p>
          <p>She wrote some poetry, had a small library of the works of Whitman,
            Longfellow and others, but her favorite poet was Emily Dickinson.</p>
          <p>She also collected antique demitasse cups and small tea sets.</p>
          <p>I never regarded her as a particularly good overall cook.
            (Successfully making jello remained elusive.) But she had some
            dishes that were very good.&nbsp; And she excelled at making a meal
            out of whatever ingredients were on hand and feeding her family on a
            limited budget.</p>
          <p>She worked at a variety of jobs. Secretarial jobs with insurance
            agencies. Being in charge of the candy counter at Sears -- that's
            where she met future husband George Gibson -- he worked for Sears as
            an appliance repairman. And she had a long and well appreciated job
            with Red Cross.&nbsp; All a boss had to do was say something like
            "Send a thank you letter." Or, "Send congratulations," etc. and
            she'd take it from there. She had a feel for marketing. One year her
            candy counter had a lot of candy canes left over after
            Christmas.&nbsp; They weren't selling at 10¢ apiece, so she put up a
            sign saying "Special. 2 for 25¢" and quickly sold out! </p>
          <p>She was "unlucky in love." I liked some of her suitors who my
            parents disapproved of and think some would have made better
            husbands than she ended up with. Her first husband, George, always
            treated me fine, I have no complaints there. But he didn't do as
            well by his wife and son. He was a navy cook in the south Pacific
            during the war. And he did very good impersonations of Jerry Lewis.
            But he had issues, especially with his employers and honesty. As I
            remember it, the only reason he wasn't prosecuted is that my parents
            and their lawyer visited the DA and got charges dropped. </p>
          <p>But indirectly, he played a role in my getting to hear my favorite
            poet, e.e cummings, do reading. He needed a bunch of tests done at
            the VA hospital in Syracuse. And needed another driver to come
            along, so I went with him. It was going to take several hours, so
            after dropping him off, I went to the nearby campus of Syracuse U.
            to look around and kill time. I had just started walking around,
            when a poster caught my eye. It announced that cummings would be
            giving readings at something or other hall in ten minutes. I asked
            directions, hurried off, and arrived at the lecture hall just in
            time. Seeing him in action as he brought his works to life -- and
            listening to his pauses and speed ups, changes in inflection and
            pitch was so very instructive about how he wanted them to sound.
            Someone just reading a page would have no idea how animated he
            wanted a 'Whee' to sound -- or the different voices he used. I am
            grateful for that, but it doesn't atone for George's misdeeds.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>After several years of being a single mom, she married Herb. He was
            older, a retired IBM factory worker. He owned his home and had a
            good pension and benefits. And savings. I suspect she saw financial
            stability and a home for herself and her son. But it didn't work out
            as she had hoped. As time went on, Herb's drinking problem grew. One
            morning she called and said "He hit me last night. Come get me." I
            was happy to oblige and immediately left and retrieved her and as
            many belongings as we could fit in the car. (We went back later for
            the rest of her things.) She didn't divorce him, she wanted to stay
            on his health insurance, which was a very generous plan, but they
            remained separated until his death.</p>
          <p>Interpersonal relations were her strong point. She had many
            friends, several of them life-long. She was a good friend, a great
            listener, and could keep confidences. Even when illnesses limited
            what she could do, she still helped others. For example she
            volunteered for years for a suicide prevention hot line. Even when
            she was in a nursing home and struggling with vascular dementia,
            residents on her floor selected her as their representative. And she
            conducted drawing classes.</p>
          <p>She wanted to be cremated. But surprised me with her request for
            what to do with he ashes. She knew I lived near the Appalachian
            Trail (a half hour drive from it) and have spent a lot of time on
            it. So she said "I've always wanted to go on the Appalachian Trail,
            but never was able to. You know it well. Pick a place that has a
            nice vista or one that's pretty and spread my ashes there. By that
            time I wasn't so spry myself, but I picked a glen I'm sure she would
            have liked, with lots of mountain laurel and rhododendron, and
            scattered her ashes there, at a spot from which you can see the
            trail, maybe 100 feet away. </p>
          <p>But if she had had a tombstone a fitting epitaph would be "She made
            art and friends all her life."</p>

          <p>It's easy to think of Anne and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/Wiki/Thompson-47217">Hank</a>
            as being complete opposites. He was a mathematical prodigy, but math
            was her bugaboo. She had great people skills. Perhaps unfairly, I
            think of him as having "social dyslexia" and often seeing things
            backwards. Sometimes I thought that if he saw a "little old lady"
            struggling with an attempted purse snatcher, he would sympathize
            with the poor teenager, who was being savagely attacked with an
            umbrella.</p>
          <p>He was closest in age to me (13 years older vs Tom's 17 years) and
            we often shared the same bedroom, but I knew him the least well.
            Partly because he was away to college; in the army in Washington
            state; living in Norwich, NY; or in the air force in Germany,
            Pakistan or Maryland.</p>
          <p>And partly because I felt his wife bullied me, so I often avoided
            them. Her excuse was that my mother had over-protected me (true) and
            that I needed to be "toughened up" to be able to stand army life
            when I got drafted. I never bought that story. I'd had rheumatic
            fever as a kid and still had a murmur. I instantly flunked my
            physical when the doctor walked down the line and gave us a
            once-over glance and was 4-F, unfit for service. I believe she just
            picked on me for the fun of it.</p>
          <p>When Anne and I talked about Hank, she would almost always say, "He
            was such a sweet child." My earliest clear memories of him were when
            he had polio and was in a body cast for spinal scoliosis. --
            miserable in the summer heat before a/c, with sweat rolling down his
            neck and disappearing beneath the cast. And later, of him working
            (w/o the cast) on his extensive stamp collection -- stamps spread
            out on a card table or dining-room table, stamp tongs, Scott's
            catalogue at hand, a <a href="https://www.stampboards.com/viewtopic.php?t=68090">Stanley
              Gibbons Color Guide</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation_gauge">perforation
              gauge</a>, an open bowl of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tetrachloride">carbon
              tetra-chloride</a> to detect watermarks filling the room with
            toxic, brain killing vapors and a towel for to place the carbon-tet
            soaked stamps on till they dried (which didn't take long).</p>
          <p>Before my time he went to a number of country schools in the
            Binghamton area. When they lived in The Town of Binghamton just
            south of the city in a neighborhood known officially as "Park
            Terrace Heights" (and informally as "Dog Hill") he formed a close
            friendship with two neighbors named 'Courtright,' and the three
            referred to themselves as "us twins."</p>
          <p>He had a remarkable brain. When a teacher presented a difficult
            math problem he'd often have the right answer immediately. But if
            the teacher asked what steps he'd gone through to get the answer, he
            often was out of luck and didn't get credit because he hadn't gone
            through any conscious steps -- the answer just popped into his head.</p>
          <p> Like a number of card players I've known, he could remember every
            trick, in every hand, in every game of bridge all night. Who had bid
            what. And who had played what. He would sometimes say "In the third
            hand of the fourth game tonight, when you got the lead you lead the
            __ of __. But you should have led ___." More remarkably he could
            play simultaneous games of chess -- blindfolded. One of his hobbies
            was cryptography, which I suspect came in useful when he was in the
            Air Force, but assigned to NSA. I say "suspect" because he wasn't
            allowed to say much about what he did there.</p>
          <p>When he was going to Syracuse U., he would come home for holidays
            and breaks and bring homework. Some of his accounting courses had
            amazingly dull and pointless exercises. Just doing many, similar
            arithmetic problems for drill. Not teaching you anything -- just the
            same old problems done in grade schools for years, but with more
            digits in the numbers and more numbers in a column. Stuff that any
            accountant or bookkeeper would have done on an adding machine.
            Naturally they bored him to death. But they seemed like fun
            exercises to me because I wasn't used to working with so many digits
            on a page. So, I would do his accounting exercises for him while he
            was home.</p>
          <p>When he was gong to Syracuse U., one of the jobs he had was as a
            short-order cook, 3rd shift, at a greasy spoon lunch counter.&nbsp;
            They didn't get a lot of customers that late at night. Mostly
            regulars. The menu never changed, so he was annoyed by one of the
            regulars, would come in every night and say "What's new on the menu
            tonight?" One night, shortly before that customer was due, a bat got
            in the kitchen and they somehow killed it with brooms. Just before
            that customer came in and asked, "What's new on the menu tonight?"
            And was told "bat burgers." Thinking he was playing along with the
            joke, he answered "Fine, I'll have one of those." City health
            department and liability insurance not being then what they are now,
            Hank discretely dropped the bat in the deep fat fryer basket, and in
            a couple of minutes, put it in a large hamburger bun and served it.
            The customer took a bite, realized something was different than
            expected, opened the bun, put a napkin over his mouth and made a mad
            dash to the bathroom. Apparently neither the owner nor the health
            department were notified, so Hank didn't lose his job. But that
            customer never again asked "What's new."</p>
          <p>A couple of stories about Anne's practical jokes say more about her
            than him. She didn't play them often -- all the better to surprise.
            When she thought he's gone out for a night of poker and drinking,
            she liked to "<a href="https://www.instructables.com/Short-Sheet-Bed-Prank/">short
              sheet</a>" his bed. But the crowning achievement (from a practical
            joker's point of view) -- and also the meanest, was the way she
            sabotaged one of his big dates. There was a girl he'd been wanting
            to ask out for some time, but was hesitant to try.&nbsp; Finally he
            found the courage to ask her out and was ecstatic that she accepted.
            You need to know that he had major sinus problems. This was before
            the days of pocket Kleenex. He would go through six or more
            handkerchiefs per night, so he would stuff he pants and jacket
            pockets with them, using the ones in his pants pockets first. She
            waited till he had done that. When he left the room for a minute,
            she removed one of the handkerchiefs from his sports jacket pocket
            (knowing he'd use the handkerchiefs in his pants pockets first) and
            replaced it with a pair of her frilliest, laciest, underpants. Sure
            enough that first date went well -- until, later in the evening, he
            reached into his jacket pocket for a handkerchief --- and pulled out
            a pair of lacy panties. No amount of explaining worked. "It's not
            what you think." "They're my sister's." "She's playing a joke on
            me." One relationship down in flames. </p>
          <p>All during WW2 he tried to enlist but was turned down by all the
            branches, including the Coast Guard. Nobody wanted someone with
            curvature of the spine, who had double hernia operations, who was
            color blind and couldn't see much with out his glasses and was post
            polio. Even at some of the peaks of the war, when they were
            desperate for manpower, he was turned down. Given that history, it's
            bizarre that he was drafted, when he had a job he liked, in what
            appears to have been one of the Broome Co. Draft Board's biggest
            screw ups. The Korean War was still active and the board had a
            significant quota to fill. But, rather than take younger, more fit
            candidates, they chose to fill all the slots, with guys who had been
            repeatedly passed over -- for sound reasons. They took a bunch of
            guys who had serious medical issues, but were about to turn 26 and
            become ineligible for the draft, and filled their quota entirely
            with them. Hank was the only one who made it through basic training.
            All the others were given medical discharges. I vaguely recall him
            being stationed in El Passo, because I remember that his chronic
            sinusitis cleared up in the higher altitude and low humidity. I have
            some of his letters from then packed away, in which he mentions a
            school he'd applied for. As I recall the army would send him there
            during his 2nd year of service -- but only if he would agree to
            extend his enlistment for one additional year. He took the deal and
            was sent to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site">Hanford
              works</a> in eastern WA, as part of a radar controlled
            anti-aircraft battery, protecting our plutonium production
            facilities from Soviet bombers. Regardless of whether his being
            stationed there deterred the Soviets from attacking it may have been
            a factor in his later getting bladder cancer although thyroid cancer
            was probably a bigger risk.</p>
          <p>But while stationed there, he met a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Army_Corps">WAC</a>,
            Sgt. <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Diehl-1359">Ellen Diehl</a>,
            who had a sharp mind and an even sharper tongue. They arranged some
            joint leave time and he brought her home to "meet the family." Dad
            was a tough audience to audition for. About the only female he
            approved of "marrying into the family," was my Cousin Dave's <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/McNitt-155">first
              wife</a>. I can't imagine anyone not liking Evelyn.</p>
          <p>Anne once told me a strange story about that visit. A story that
            Hank told her. Why he would tell it to her seems hard to understand.
            She thought he told her because he regarded it as "cute." As I
            remember it, Hank told Anne that before the visit he said to Ellen,
            "I'm anxious for you to meet my sister. She's dear to me and I love
            her very much." To which Ellen supposedly replied "In that case, I
            hate her." To me that sounds more like jealousy than "cuteness."
            Assuming that account of the conversation is reasonably accurate, I
            find it hard to imagine anyone thinking it was a good idea to tell
            it to your sister. (Unless they had social dyslexia.)</p>
          <p>During that visit, Ellen quickly sensed the rivalry between my
            mother and grandmother and tried to build an alliance with gram as a
            counterweight to whatever influence mom and Anne might have. I think
            with some success. After having a daughter in WA, their army time
            was up and they moved to Norwich , NY where he managed an Army &amp;
            Navy store. I don't remember the details (if I ever knew them), but
            the owner got into some kind of a mess (bad check maybe) and the
            store closed.</p>
          <p>Hank could never have passed the Air Force's physical, which was
            more rigorous than draftees, but because he had been out of the army
            for less than a year, didn't need one. He enlisted in the Air Force
            and was sent to training in Ithaca, NY on servicing data processing
            equipment, and moved there with his family. He put in 17 years with
            the Air Force, which with his time in the Army enabled him to retire
            with 20 years credit. Most of that time was on assignment to NSA.
            Our parents were aging, so when he retired, he took a job with
            Xerox, servicing their copiers, living first in Susquehanna, PA and
            then in Great Bend, PA. After they died, he moved back to MD,
            reading and fishing. He had smoked for years, but found a way to
            quit that worked for him. </p>
          <p>COPD finally did him in. In one of our last conversations, he told
            me that he had regrets about not "living up to his potential." That
            he should have used his mathematical and mental gifts to have
            accomplished. But he made good use of them in one way. Thanks to his
            mathematical skills and business education, he invested his military
            and Xerox pensions wisely and left an estate that has benefited
            family and others.</p>
          <p>(BTW, He was an excellent uncle to my younger son, Steve.)</p>

          <p> If you've read the previous chapters you already have read a lot
            about me. There's no need to duplicate any of that here. But I've
            placed miscellaneous things here as the spirit moved.</p>
          <h4> Civil Rights Movement </h4>
          <p> I'm sure I would have gotten involved in the Civil Rights
            movement, one way or another. But my path resulted from
            conversations with a sort of neighbor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lewis_Moore">William
              L. Moore</a>. I forget how we first met, but he knew my siblings,
            perhaps from when they'd lived in Park Terrace Heights, adjoining
            Binghamton to the south, which is where he lived. He was a postal
            worker and took the bus to and from work. I lived about half way
            between the end of the bus line and his house. In warm weather I'd
            often be doing yard work when he came by. It was all uphill to his
            house, so if I waved, he'd be glad to take a break and enjoy a glass
            of cold lemonade. He was well read and had many interests, so there
            was lots to talk about, including his 1955 book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lewis_Moore"><u>The
                Mind In Chains: Autobiography of a Schizophrenic</u></a>. He
            thought the way shock treatments were done was pretty barbaric. A
            family friend of ours had recently had them and underwent major
            personality changes as a result, so I was interested in learning
            about it. I wouldn't call him a friend, we never socialized other
            than these chats, but we were friendly acquaintances and I think
            both enjoyed our chats.</p>
          <p>I was shocked when I read of his death as a civil rights martyr. My
            wife and I went to his memorial service and were impressed with the
            way the Rev. Woodward, a Unitarian-Universalist, dealt respectfully
            with Bill's atheist beliefs. When a local chapter of <a hewd="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Racial_Equality">C.O.R.E.</a>
            formed and named itself the "William L. Moore Chapter," we joined
            (as did Rev. Woodward). I won't bore you with all of the activities,
            just mention a couple highlights. I previously mentioned having to
            jump out of the way when someone deliberately drove a car into a
            picket line I was in. (No one was hurt, we all managed to jump in
            time.) That protest happened to involve a classmate I knew from
            college.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#India" id="India-ref"></a>
            He was from southern India and had dark skin. He'd applied for a job
            as cook at a local diner, and the owner took one look one look at
            his skin color and turned him down -- a violation of NYS law.
            Leaders of our chapter talked to the owner, who was adamant. There
            was no way they were going to hire a "colored" cook. Eventually we
            ended the picketing and sit-in and helped file a complaint with the
            state Civil Rights Commission.</p>
          <p>My main activity with the Chapter involved being chair of their
            Housing committee. Binghamton had a small African-American
            community, most of them descendants of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad">underground
              railroad</a> escaped slaves, and having lived in the area for
            generations, has no discernible accent when calling on the phone.
            People would come to us for help after they'd made an appointment to
            see a house or apartment and were told, "Sorry it's just been rented
            (or sold)," but doubted the claim. We would arrange for two teams, a
            couple each, to test the situation. A black couple would schedule an
            appointment, and a white couple would schedule an appointment
            shortly after. The black couple would show up and be given the "It's
            just been rented/sold" story. And then the white couple would follow
            up and, miraculously, the apartment/house was magically available.
            (The name of the woman who usually went with me as my wife actually
            was "Mrs. Thompson.") When we confronted the landlord/agent
            sometimes they'd relent knowing they'd been caught red handed. Often
            they'd make an excuse, such as, "I'm not prejudice, but if I rent to
            them my other tenants will leave." We would negotiate with them,
            offer help, and try to resolve the problem. Sometimes we'd help file
            a complaint. Occasionally they would be hard-line segregationists
            and say, "OK then, I'll just take it off the market."</p>
          <p>While in CORE I met two especially memorable people, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Farmer">James
              Farmer, Jr.</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Peck_%28pacifist%29">James
              Peck</a>. Farmer was an inspirational presence, radiating calm
            confidence. He had a great achievement as a teenager, portrayed in
            Denzel Washington's 2007 biographical drama, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Debaters#:%7E:text=The%20Great%20Debaters%20is%20a,1997%20issue%20of%20American%20Legacy.">
              <u>The Great Debaters</u></a>, which I strongly recommend
            watching. James Peck was a more tragic figure. He played a big part
            in the 1964 <a href="https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/freedom-summer">Freedom
              Summer</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Freedom-Rides">Freedom
              Rides</a>. In 1963, before we went to the March on Washington for
            Jobs and Freedom, he came to our chapter and conducted a course on
            passive resistance and how to cover out heads for protection if
            beaten by night sticks. Fortunately I never had to test the
            training. But it was inadequate to the viscous attacks he was
            subjected to in '64. (If you search his name on the Internet you
            will see lots of pictures of his bleeding and later bandaged head.)
            I don't think he ever fully recovered. I met Farmer and Peck twice
            and got to chat with them both times. In my second meeting with
            Peck, he understandably seemed a bitter man.</p>
          <h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_for_Jobs_and_Freedom">1963
              March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom</a> </h4>
          <p>Two busloads went from our C.O.R.E. chapter.We didn't know what to
            expect. In many ways, Washington, DC was still a "southern city" and
            segregated. As mentioned above, we were trained in passive
            resistance - not knowing what to expect from local police or from
            KKK counter demonstrators. As we approached the route of the march,
            it was comforting to see National Guardsmen lining the streets. Just
            a single line of them, but on both sides of the streets. (We didn't
            know that their rifles were loaded with blanks.) Some of them may
            have been KKK members, but their presence was comforting anyway. It
            made it seem less likely that KKK thugs would attack the marchers.
            It was well organized. The bus drivers knew just where to go and
            told us where to find them for our return. Volunteer "march
            marshals" helped direct everyone where to go -- which units were
            assembling where. We had a great vantage point, and could watch the
            marchers pass by, while waiting for our turn to join the march. Each
            unit carried banners identifying what organization they were with or
            what union local. I could hear the speeches via amplifiers mounted
            on light poles -- and recognize many prominent figures at the front
            of their units: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dubinsky">Dave
              Dubinsky</a> of the Garment Workers Union. And the UAW's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Reuther">Walter</a>
            and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_G._Reuther">Victor
              Reuther</a>. And on and on. Countless ministers, priests, rabbis
            and nuns from every faith group you can think of. The marchers move
            slowly because of congestion at the Mall. So we got to see many of
            the speakers and performers as we crept past the grandstand. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter,_Paul_and_Mary">Peter,
              Paul and Mary</a> performed for us. And I was thrilled to see and
            hear two of the days organizers whom I had long admired, the
            inspirational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayard_Rustin">Bayard
              Rustin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Philip_Randolph">A.
              Philip Randolph</a>. We were on the opposite side of the pool and
            out of sight of the speakers when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. gave
            his largely impromptu "I have a Dream Speech," but someone had a
            portable radio we heard it on. Of course I knew of Dr. King from his
            involvement in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_bus_boycott">Montgomery
              Bus Boycott</a>. But I went home thinking that the great speech of
            the day, that would become famous, was the one Bayard Rustin gave.
            (That's not the first time I've been wrong.) I wanted to participate
            in the 50th anniversary of the March but had some kind of a
            conflict. I probably can't walk far enough to participate in future
            ones and am reluctant to do it in a wheelchair, but a
            multi-passenger golf cart might be OK.</p>
          <h4> Community Organizing and Community Service </h4>
          <p>I'm proud of my efforts at community organizing, but don't think of
            any stories that would interest you. I did quite a bit of community
            service such as: serving on the Johnson City, NY Library Board and
            the Binghamton-Johnson City Joint Sewage Board (that may sound
            funny, but clean waters have always been important to me since my
            childhood memories of dodging floating feces while swimming in the
            Susquehanna River); Asst. Scoutmaster, chair of the Common Cause
            chapter for our Congressional District, member of NAACP, C.O.R.E.
            and peace organizations. </p>
          <h4> Civic Engagement in Partisan Politics </h4>
          <p> I started out intending to be an Independent, even though all in
            my family had been Republicans ever since Lincoln ran for president.
            One of my mother's earliest memories was of marching in a torchlight
            parade for McKinley's election. I wasn't 21 yet, so I couldn't
            register for the 1956 election, but in campus snack bar discussions
            I supported maverick Republican <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Javits">Jacob
              Javits</a>' run for US Senate -- and when I could register a few
            weeks later, did so as an Independent. I have always believed that
            one party dominance in an area leads to stagnation, cronyism, and
            party hacks being selected for office because they'll "go along."
            And that competition between parties is essential to good
            government. Republicans dominated in that area<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
              href="#BillyHill" id="BillyHill-ref"></a>, so when I wanted to
            vote in a primary and had to enroll in a party, I picked the
            underdog Democrats.</p>

                that confirms what Fritz says about the discipline. She said the
                curfew for females' dorms was 8 PM. One semester, in the last
                few days before graduation, 3 girls decided to celebrate by
                going to a drug store in Mansfield and have sodas. But they

                the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_Pythias">Knights
                  of Pythias</a> (but never participated in my time). My only
                interest in lodges was in beaver lodges -- those interested Tom
                too. He and Gret rented a lot on a lake and he liked to watch
                the industrious beavers come and go and add to their lodge.<a href="#Lodges-ref"

                subjective and lacking quantitative support. Similar
                accusations, perhaps with cause, were leveled at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung">Carl
                  Jung</a>. Funding may not be available, but I'm confident that
                if a large scale study was made, factor analysis would come up
                with similar categories -- even if not identical to Gardner's
                types. It's outside my field of competence, but my impression is
                that of the 3 founders of psychiatry, Freud, Jung and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler">Adler</a>,
                history has shown Adler's ideas to be closer to modern
                psychiatry. All three were medical men and "just armchair
                scientists."<a href="#IntelligenceTypes-ref" aria-label="Back to content">↵</a></p>

              <p>He was a somewhat tragic person. I remember in our freshman and
                sophomore years he would talk enthusiastically about how he
                would gain loads of knowledge in his studies and could return to
                his rural village and help them enter the 20th century. But one
                day (I think in his junior year) he was on the brink of tears.
                My recollection is that he said something like "I can't go back.
                I wanted to help them. But I just can't face it. The dirt
                floors. The flies. The heat. I just can't."<a href="#India-ref"

              <p>Broome County politics were dominated by former politician,

                To his credit, he didn't believe party organizations should take
                sides in primaries, but they did make sure that "amenable"
                candidates filed for office -- whom it seemed to me often had
                minimal qualifications.<a href="#BillyHill-ref" aria-label="Back to content">↵</a></p>
