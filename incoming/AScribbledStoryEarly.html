          <h3>Preface</h3>
          <div class="w3-container" style="font-style:oblique;">
            <p>Perhaps there is no particular reason why I should record my life
              except that so much of it has seemed highly interesting to me and
              I have enjoyed it. As I look back, I can see so clearly how
              certain incidents and experiences were so purposeful in preparing
              me for much that was to follow.</p>
            <p>Being a highly sensitive child I was often quick to be impressed
              by some incidents that were never considered of great importance
              by anyone else and not at all intended to particularly affect me,
              but which nevertheless did. As such events come to mind, I shall
              record them. Perhaps my narrative will not always be in
              chronological order.</p>
            <p>If other eyes than mine should ever read these words, I trust
              they will be charitable and not look for literary merit or
              purposeful construction. I am impelled by no motive other than to
              <u>write</u>. </p>
            <p><b><u>Dec. 30, 1991.</u></b> When did I begin to write my story?
              I'm not certain. Perhaps it was in my 80s, so I shall put down
              September 30, 1985 as a possible date for when I took up my pen
              and wrote the first words of this, "The Story of My Life."</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="w3-container w3-serif">
          <p>According to a letter written by my <a href="HugheyHerbert1857.html">
              father</a>, Sept. 23, 1899 I was born three days previous, Sept.
            20th, 1899, on a Wednesday at 11 o'clock at night and I weighed 8
            lbs 11 oz. I was born on the old home farm in Long Lake Township,
            Crow Wing County, Minnesota, about six miles from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainerd,_Minnesota">Brainerd</a>.
          </p>
          <p>After scrutinizing me for three days, my father had decided that my
            skin was fair and my eyes were blue. Perhaps he had the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday%27s_Child">rhyme</a>
            mixed in his mind and credited Wednesday's child with fairness or
            perhaps he was one of those gentlemen who really prefer blondes. </p>
          <blockquote style="padding-left:10%;">"Monday's child is fair of face<br>
            Tuesday's child is full of grace<br>
            Wednesday's child is full of woe,<br>
            Thursday's child works hard for a living<br>
            But the child that's born on the Sabbath day<br>
            Is happy and blithesome, loving and gay."</blockquote>
          <p>At any rate, I soon belied his words by absorbing so much of the
            tawniness that sun and exposure bestowed that I could scarcely be
            rated fair, and my eyes turned a fairly dark brown, rimmed by rather
            long brown lashes. They must have been the must have been the most
            attractive part of my face, for I do not recall anyone ever ever
            saying that I was a pretty child, but often, though they would look
            again at my eyes and make some remark about them. Those remarks
            ceased when I covered my eyes with spectacles at the age of sixteen.</p>
          <p>Our house was not beautiful. At the time of my birth, it needed new
            siding and painting and likely re-shingling. A picture I have of my
            <a href="BixbyHannah1863.html">mother</a> and me, taken when I was a
            year or less, shows the weatherbeaten old house with a rough board
            shed built onto the west. That old shed had a great fascination for
            me as a child. Boxes of old clothes afforded me costumes to dress up
            in. Hazelnuts and butternuts were kept in cans out there and I could
            help myself and as long as the supply lasted. Old magazines
            accumulated there and contained much to interest me. Many of my most
            treasured paper dolls came from their pages. Old copies of the
            "Youth's Companion" were read and reread. I was truly sorry when the
            homely old shed was torn down, to be supplanted by a "west bedroom."</p>
          <p>I suppose it was a bit of the regret that I felt with its passing
            that made me put it into a little poem which I wrote when I studied
            composition under Roger Sergel,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#RogerSergel"
              id="RogerSergel-ref"></a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_State_University_Moorhead">Moorhead
              State Teachers College</a> in 1922. Here's the poem:</p>
          <blockquote style="padding-left:10%; font-style:oblique;"> "There's a
            black cloud in the west,<br>
            Big drops begin to fall,<br>
            The wind has whipped a board<br>
            From off our shed.<br>
            The hens go by with huddled wings.<br>
            Grandma looks anxious,<br>
            But Grandpa, reassured, looks overhead,<br>
            "Just a mere squall, the clouds are partin',<br>
            Shet that south winder," was all he said. </blockquote>
          <p>The picture of mother and me shows the rain barrels in the corner.
            We always had them with long boards which had to be arranged <u>just
              so,</u> at every shower, to catch the drip from the eaves, for we
            never had eave spouts.</p>
          <p>In rainy seasons we could be more lavish with this precious "soft
            water" for "washing up" in the morning. This was a luxury, for our
            well water was very hard, and soap would curdle it and cause our
            skins to feel gummy. It also aggravated a grimy ring on the wash
            basin, which became my job to scour off.</p>
          <p>When there was plenty of soft water in the barrels, one would go
            out with the big gray enameled dipper and dip it up, full slightly
            yellowed water, maybe stained from the roof shingles or from the
            barrels, I don't know. I remember it always having a yellowish cast,
            and with a soft water smell. That was one of the smells I liked and
            cherish. The lake water smelled similarly. with the addition of the
            smell of rushes. So did the cistern water which we had down at the
            "shop" in the cistern. The water in the barrels often had wrigglers
            in it. Little patches of gray mosquito eggs appeared on the water,
            from time to time and no one thought to watch and destroy them
            before the wrigglers hatched--to soon become mosquitoes.</p>
          <p>Once I attempted to teach some kittens to swim in the rain barrels
            and I received a lecture from my father who forbad my ever trying
            that again. A few years later, I was truly horrified when an orphan
            boy who lived with us for awhile, tried the same stunt in the lake.
            He had taken my baby <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Peterson-6107">niece</a>
            along for an audience. She could not have been more than about three
            years of age. They had gone out in the boat and he had thrown the
            kittens into the water, from the boat. When the frightened creatures
            would try to reach the boat and scramble in, Walter would push them
            back with the oar. Whether Irma cried and attracted my father or
            what, I don't know, but he appeared on the scene, and doubtless,
            Walter got the same lecture I had gotten.</p>
          <p>The old picture of mother and me shows a grape basket hanging near
            the eaves at the back door. I can't say "on the porch" for we never
            gave the back entrance so fancy a name. It was the "stoop" and
            "stoop" it remained for many years. No one needs to tell me what was
            in that basket. I'm positive it was clothes pins, for she kept it
            hanging on the stoop where she would grab it on the way to or from
            the clothes line.</p>
          <p>The "stoop" was nothing of beauty, but it boasted one thing of
            which my mother was very proud. The little steps at the end were
            made by my brother <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hughey-1584">Edd</a>
            and my mother thought he showed much skill for a boy. I doubt if the
            steps which show in my picture are the ones that Edd made, for my
            memory tells me they were like stair steps which these in the
            picture are more like a slanting ladder with steps instead of rungs.</p>
          <p>We children lost a few treasures down the cracks between the floor
            boards of the old stoop. Marbles rolled through and evaded our
            reach. When the stoop was torn up and a small back porch was built
            in its place, I remember watching eagerly to see if I could spot any
            of our lost treasures, but I do not recall finding anything.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/wildflowers/common-knotgrass">Knot
              grass</a> covered the back yard, except where the wash water had
            been thrown and where the paths were worn. </p>
          <p>Our house had only four rooms until we built on the west bedroom.
            The kitchen was the most used room. Everyone came to its door.
            Family and company alike ate around the large table. Many a
            wonderful meal and much good fellowship comes to mind as one- thinks
            of that table. Many a time I hurried across the field, coming home
            from with a hungry eagerness to see what mother had been baking.
            "Riz biscuits," best of all, when flavored with cinnamon and sugar.
            They were the chief delight. Hot, covered with sweet fresh homemade
            butter. I can't tell you how good they tasted! I've often tried to
            make biscuits like them, but they never seem the same. Maybe the
            butter helped make a difference. Mother won the prize year after
            year at the county fair with her butter--butter that always took <u>first
              place</u> no matter how much competition she had. </p>
          <p>Mother and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Emner-3">her
              mother</a> before her were the greatest cooks in the world! No
            cooking school turns out better ones. Never will I forget the family
            occasions when we gathered at Grandmother's to enjoy such a variety
            and quality of food as would put any expensive meal I ever ate in a
            hotel to shame.</p>
          <p>There was a pantry off our kitchen. Sometimes we called it a
            "buttery." (I think Grandma Bixby always did.) There the food was
            kept and on the highest shelves the best dishes were stored, also,
            on one shelf the medicines for man and beast were kept.</p>
          <p><img src="CookieJar.png" alt="Drawing of cookies and cookie jar" style="width:20%;">The
            cookie jar was a large stone crock which was always within reach and
            never hidden. We children were never refused cookies for lunch, as
            long as the supply lasted. Neighbor children, too, knew how good
            mother's molasses cookies were. Nor were those cookies the dainty,
            tea table variety. They were big, round, thick, cookies, worthy of
            the name, sometimes iced with a boiled white icing, made by beating
            hot syrup into the beaten whites of eggs. </p>
          <p>Mother's recipe for the cookies called for:</p>

          <p>Many of those cookies topped the lunch we carried in our buckets to
            school, and sometimes Mother tucked in an extra one for us to give
            to the best chum, or to "swap" for a bit of Swedish or Norwegian
            cookery.</p>
          <p>About half of our community were Scandinavians: Swedish, Norwegian
            or Danish. My father called them all "Swedes" and despised their
            foreign ways. It irked him to hear them exchange their "j's" for
            "y's" and he blamed them for all the lack of progress our community
            might suffer. Local politics made semi-feuds of every school meeting
            when one faction, led by my father, voted for "nine months of school
            and higher taxes," while the others thriftily considered the value
            of a little extra help at planting and harvesting time, so voted
            stubbornly for eight months and a lower school tax.</p>

              style="width:25%;">Dad had some boon companions, among the Danes
            particularly, however. "Sam Hansen" and Dad would meet on the street
            corner every week in Brainerd and talk for hours until both families
            would wonder if they were ever coming home. They did not go into
            saloons or pool halls. They simply <u>met,</u> perhaps at O'Briens
            Grocery, and talked offer the township, state and nation. It never
            occurred to them to visit one another when in the country. "Going to
            town" seemed to provide the opportunity and an excuse to loaf.
            Saturday was usually was farmers' day in town. Horses were tied to
            hitching posts or, if the weather was bad and the stay long, "put
            up" in Purdy's Livery Stable. I believe it was Purdy's. At least I
            know it was Mr. Purdy who admired our matched team of grays and
            would willingly have bought them for his livery.</p>
          <p>My earliest memory is of the time when <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bixby-1158">Aunt
              Minnie</a> and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hepperly-1">Uncle
              George Hepperly</a> came to visit us. I remember the day. Aunt
            Minnie took my picture with her big plate camera.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
              href="#PlateCamera" id="PlateCamera"></a> Water lilies and other
            wildflowers made a background and I was posed in various ways.</p>
          <p> I took smallpox while they were there, as did Uncle George, and,
            when convalescing days might have dragged tediously, they were
            shortened and made more pleasant for me by Uncle George cuddling me
            in the old hammock out under the pines. There, somewhat shunned by
            others, we comforted and amused one another. I was about 1 1/2 years
            old, but I do have a few vivid recollections of some things, which
            though trivial, perhaps, for some reason impressed me and so have
            loomed large in my memory. I remember crying the day Aunt Minnie and
            Uncle George left us to go back to their home in Salt Lake City.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I remember the day I was vaccinated a few. months later, and it
            didn't "take" for I had <u>had</u> smallpox. I remember the doctor
            pinched my toe and remarked about my button shoes which had red
            stitching for trimming.</p>
          <p>I think I have one recollection, which antedates these, but I
            hesitate to tell it for my brothers would always whoop in scornful
            glee of my insistence that I <u>do</u> remember when I used the
            teacher's combination hot water bottle and enema bag for a sled and
            came dragging it out into the living room to the consternation of
            everyone present.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#TeacherRoomBoard"
              id="TeacherRoomBoard"></a> Also the quick, but horrified action of
            my mother, who bundled me back into the bedroom "in a hurry." I
            think the teacher was Lydia Neighnabour (or Neighnaubor) (<a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hughey-1582">Carrie</a>
            wrote this for my information) as we called her. I can't spell her
            name.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#Lydia" id="Lydia-ref"></a></p>
          <p>Mother made for me a beautiful little soft, bright, red cashmere
            dress when I was three. It had a lace yoke edged with gold braid and
            it had a big soft red satin sash. I wore it to Grandma Bixby's one
            day and stood too close to the big round heater. The pungent smell
            of scorched wool made someone whirl me around, but not soon enough
            to save my dress which was burned all across the back of the skirt.
            That dress is the one I wore when our family group picture was made.
            How I delayed things that day by not keeping my hand on father's
            knee, as was posed! The photographer would no sooner get under his
            black cape than down would come my hand. <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hughey-1587">Harry</a>
            had to stand on a box to be seen properly, but he stood very
            straight and obedient, with his shiny celluloid collar and knee
            pants. The photographer finally gave up and let me rest my hand on
            Mamma's knee, where it was more at home anyway.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
              href="#HugheyGroupPhoto" id="HugheyGroupPhoto-ref"></a> </p>
          <p>Father was always kind to me, but I never felt at ease with him
            when I was a little child. He liked to tease and was unpredictable.
            He thought it was good fun to rub his scratchy chin whiskers against
            my face and I hated it so, I avoided him. What a lot of fun and
            companionship we missed because I endeavored to keep a safe distance
            from him. He was a great reader and I soon learned that he did not
            like to be bothered when he read. I never really got acquainted with
            my father until my senior year in high school when he was in Montana
            with my brother Edd. That year and the ones following while he was
            on the claim, I cherished for the correspondence we carried on.
            Those letters revealed my father to me in ways which were a precious
            experience. </p>
          <p>There is one childhood remembrance of Dad, which I'd like to
            relate. The Christmas I turned was four, Santa Claus came to our
            house in a "big way." Papa (that's what he liked me to call him)
            took me in the kitchen Christmas Eve and turned down the lamp.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
              href="#KeroseneLamp" id="KeroseneLamp-ref"></a> Then he and I sat
            in the corner and he held me there in his arms while telling me to
            be just as quiet as I could be, so Santa wouldn't hear me. It wasn't
            long before we heard bells, sleigh bells, coming on the road! Nearer
            they came and louder, and soon we heard noises on the roof, that to
            my childish ears were nothing else than the traditional pawing of
            reindeer's hoofs. Voices in the living room were interpreted to me
            by my father to be Santa Claus and Mamma in conversation. In a
            little while, the bell went down the road again and Mamma opened the
            door between the kitchen and living room and said we could come in
            --that Santa had been there and was gone.</p>
          <p><img src="Lutz---Xmas-tree-outline.svg" alt="Drawing of a Chrstmas tree"
              style="width:15%">We went in and there was the most beautiful tree
            we ever had. But at first. I hardly saw the tree, for there on one
            of the lower branches, with outstretched arms toward me was Julia,
            beautiful Julia, with her thick brown curls of real hair and eyes
            that would go to sleep. Julia, in a brown wool suspender dress, a
            white blouse, full petticoat with embroidered flounce, under pants
            that buttoned around the waist, as did the petticoat, just like a
            real lady's, trimmed with rows of fine tucking on each leg. Also, an
            under-shirt or vest that buttoned down the back. Her clothes were as
            carefully made, and as stylish, as one could wish. Julia also had a
            beautiful wool cap or "tam o'shanter" crocheted of red woolen yarn.
            On the back of her neck was the name "Floradora,"<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
              href="#Floradora" id="Floradora-ref"></a> which I couldn't ignore,
            so I gave that to her as a second name, but Julia was her <u>first</u>
            name, after a city girl I admired; Julia Wilson<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
              href="#MaryJuliaWilson" id="MaryJuliaWilson-ref"></a>, my idol,
            the daughter of the County Superintendent of Schools for Crow Wing
            County. I kept Julia carefully until I was past 40, then I had
            mother's <a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#HairExtension"
              id="HairExtension-ref">switch</a> made into a wig for her and gave
            her to <a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#DonnaMae" id="DonnaMae-ref">Donna
              Mae</a>. Later, I got her back again to keep. At present, Julia is
            with the Museum in Port Townsend.</p>
          <p><a href="CampbellEliabeth1830.html">Grandmother Hughey</a> died
            Jan. 29, 1904. I remember the night. Mother held me in her arms and
            looked down at poor Grandma as her breathing became more difficult.
            Someone from time to time would moisten her lips. Grandma had been
            an invalid for about four years having had a stroke.</p>
          <p>My earliest recollection is of Grandmother sitting in an old
            fashioned high backed rocking chair, her white hair parted in the
            middle and drawn smoothly back to a "bun" in the back. I remember
            sharing apples with her.</p>
          <p>In season, we were never without a barrel of apples in the cellar.
            Relatives in Pennsylvania would ship them to father. Carefully
            packed, choice apples with raisins and nuts placed carefully in the
            center of the barrel. After years, when the relatives had moved to
            town or died and no longer sent the barrels, we would buy a barrel
            of apples and store it away in the cellar. Hardly a winter evening
            passed without Dad going "down cellar" to get a bowl of apples,
            which we ate while we were gathered around the old Royal Oak heater.<a
              aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#RoyalOakHeater" id="RoyalOakHeater-ref"></a>
            Perhaps Dad or Mother would read aloud. Many an interesting book was
            shared that way.</p>

            and "<a href="The_Winning_of_Barbara_Worth"> The Winning of Barbara
              Worth</a>" were Dad's favorites. The last named book fired Dad's
            enthusiasm for California--the land where he longed to live.</p>
          <p>After the great San Francisco earthquake <i><span class="Annotation">[1906]</span>,</i>
            Dad went to California and worked on R.R. Bixby's carpenter crew.
            R.R. Bixby (Russell Rock Bixby)<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#RussellRBixby"
              id="RussellRBixby-ref"></a> was mother's first cousin and was
            married to that wonderful woman, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Smith-280758">Annis</a>,
            whom we children never met, but she was definitely our favorite
            relative. After dad had worked in California for about a year,
            living with Rock and Annis at 2447 Webster St., Berkeley,
            California, Mother went out for a visit and to join him on the
            return trip to Minnesota. We never tired of hearing Mother tell
            about that trip. I am sure Annis exerted a wonderful influence on
            Mother, for she was always quoting her and in ways which showed she
            had grown and expanded in her companionship.</p>
          <p><img src="Books.svg" alt="Drawing of a pile of books" style="width:15%;">To
            go back to our family reading circle--we never failed to identify
            ourselves with the characters so that every sad scene brought on a
            shower of weeping. "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Shepherd_of_Kingdom_Come_%28novel%29">The
              Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come</a>" was almost more than Dad or
            Harry could stand as they blew their noses and wiped their eyes. </p>
          <p>Harry and I "fell in" with the current juvenile vice of reading <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Alger">Alger</a> books
            and exchanged gifts of them. For a time, we had a complete
            understanding that we would buy each other nothing but them, so we
            accumulated quite a library. We cared not that our choice of reading
            lacked literary merit. We dreamed of the day when we might strike
            riches or gain fame. Thinking back on them, they seem mild compared
            to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Tracy">Dick Tracy</a>.
            (I wish I had kept a few.)</p>
          <p>How fortunate we children were in many ways. Our farm of 140 acres
            had so many interesting and beautiful spots. Around the house was
            the grove of white pines--towering at least 60 ft. high--of which we
            were so proud. They were a landmark! <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hughey-1562">Grandfather
              Hughey --</a> had planted two rows of spruce trees on either side
            of the walk or road in he front yard. They too, were beautiful. </p>
          <p>Both pines and spruce yielded me an adequate supply of gum. I could
            nearly always find a piece of pitch or resin which had hardened
            enough to be good gum.</p>
          <p>Birds galore nested in our yard. The pines were the special haven
            of the purple grackles. Mother and Dad knew the birds and flowers,
            so we children grew up knowing and loving the beauties of nature.</p>
          <p> Besides the pines and the spruces. there were a red oak, a white
            oak, a basswood, a mountain ash, a box elder (Harry got the crooked
            little sapling from Rhodes, I believe, and by carefully tying it to
            stakes induced it to grow straight,) a Norway pine by the windmill,
            a red maple by the shop, several crab apple trees and one "big
            apple" tree. The "big apple" had big green apples, good for cooking.
            Down by the chicken coup was a plum orchard, with several varieties
            of plums. Below the chicken coup were several butternut trees that
            grandfather had planted. </p>
          <p>We had a lake--on the map it was named "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Lake_%28Minnesota%29">Russell
              Lake</a>" after the man who had homesteaded our farm and from whom
            Dad had bought the farm. More than half the shore line, I would say,
            was ours. At one end was the <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Petersen-2195">John
              Peterson</a> place. Across the lake were the Lang brothers, Walter
            and Elmer--two old Danish brothers who never married. Land of other
            owners touched the east shore. beautiful white birches, wild
            cherries, both red and choke, and a mixture of oak were on the side
            of our shore. The red cherries called "pin cherries" were large and
            tasty and made delicious jelly. </p>
          <p>A small tamarack swamp with its special treasures was at the west
            end of our shore line. A few wild blueberries could be found there
            and I counted them as my special find in season. </p>
          <p>Back of the barn, extending to our west line, was a wooded lot,
            liked a park. The sheep which Dad had pastured there had cleared out
            the underbrush. Graceful poplars, oaks, and a few other trees grew
            there and along the fence were luscious wild blackberries. </p>
          <p>Between our buildings and the road which marked our north boundary
            were fields and meadows. A wild meadow occupied quite a piece, next
            to the road. Bob o'links loved to haunt this spot and red winged
            blackbirds. Quite often a bittern would take his stand there,
            probably to watch for one of the green frogs who lived there in
            abundance. Where the tame meadow came to join the wild one, bear
            berries and wild strawberries grew. </p>
          <p>What a joy it was to go berrying there with Mother. There was
            always a strawberry shortcake with plenty of cream at the next meal
            and no shortcake ever tastes as good today. </p>
          <p>Mother made two kinds, one like baking powder biscuit dough,
            slightly sweetened, the other a richer, sweeter dough, almost like
            cake. We liked either, but perhaps the biscuit variety had the
            greater favor. </p>
          <p>How the good things on Mother's table come back to us, haunting our
            taste glands 'till we nearly want to turn time back again. No one
            makes "Minute Pudding" anymore--a smooth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blancmange">blanc
              mange</a> made with flour and little or no sweetening. Sugar was
            sprinkled on or put in the cream with nutmeg. Pity the pour souls
            who never sat down to a supper of milk toast - a heaping platter of
            it, covered with thickened, sweetened milk, or bowls of golden
            cornmeal mush, sprinkled with sugar and covered with rich country
            cream. </p>
          <p>When autumn crept in with chilly fingers, Mother would banish the
            chill with a big crock of home baked beans and her famous "steamed
            Boston Brown Bread" - recipe she loved to chant and she remembered
            when other memories failed. It went like this: </p>

          <p>Father had donated a plot of ground on which the district school
            house was built, so we children went to school on our own farm. Our
            wooded pasture, where the cows were kept, came right up to the fence
            which enclosed the school yard. </p>
          <p>Probably I know this wooded lot best of all since it was my job to
            go and get the cows. Sometimes I road horseback, but usually I
            walked and the walk was always made delightful for me by with the
            wealth of nature's beauties I discovered. </p>
          <p>Sometimes it was a little bed of Indian pipes, half hidden under a
            clump of brush. In the spring, it began with violets, Trillium, May
            flowers (sometimes called wind flowers) and blood roots. Later,
            around a little pond in the woods, we found the rare pink lady's
            slipper, Minnesota's official flower. My brother Harry, and I could
            gather huge bouquets of them, not knowing we were killing those
            beauties which take uncommonly long, and in so complicated a way to
            propagate, that to pick a flower means almost certain death to the
            plant it crowns. </p>
          <p>Along the lake shore were hundreds of blue iris, or "flags" and, on
            the lake water lilies of kinds, the small yellow ones sometimes
            called spatterdock, and the magnificent big white ones, as beautiful
            as any princess arrayed for her wedding. Cattails, arrowheads and
            rushed abounded. We liked to pull up the rushes and make flat boats
            with the white end of the rush pushed upward for a smoke stack.
            These tiny boats would go gloating bravely off to be lost in the
            lake grasses and rushes.</p>
          <p><img src="RowingBoat.svg" alt="Drawing of a rowboat" style="width:20%">We
            had a boat - Harry named it "Lovers' Tub," for he was very romantic
            about that time, and so in turn, Ellen, Helen, Claire, Dorothy and
            others were privileged to go boat riding in Russell Lake. </p>
          <p>Up on the flat at the end of our lake grew sweet smelling white
            violets. I'll never forget them. When little <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Peterson-10786">Johnnie</a>
            died, I went up there in desperation and wandered back and forth
            picking a bouquet for his tiny, baby hands to hold. Our hearts were
            so wrapped in this little fellow that it was a struggle to give him
            up. But surely heaven took on new meaning and nearness for us when
            Carrie's first baby, fourteen months old, John Edgar, left us for
            Paradise. </p>
          <p>Carrie had been married at Christmas time in 1906 and Edd had built
            an arch to fit into one corner of our living room. Over this he and
            Ethel Chase, our teacher that year, had fastened greens and holly.
            It was truly beautiful and Carrie has made a pretty bride. It was a
            lark for me and I think the family had a little difficulty keeping
            me still during the ceremony. I had heard Edd and Ethel tell Carrie
            they would make faces at her and John to make them confused, and I
            thought they meant it, so I remembered watching them to the the
            "faces," thinking I might join in and make a few myself. Then Carrie
            and John moved to Esdon, a rural community with its own post office,
            not far from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Lake_Township,_Crow_Wing_County,_Minnesota">Bay
              Lake</a>. I loved to visit Carrie in her home at Esdon, sixteen
            horse-drawn miles from us. </p>
          <p>I think it was in the summer after little John died (1909) that I
            took my little pug dog, Bingo, and my doll, Julia, and went to visit
            Carrie for two whole weeks. It was wonderful, but I had never been
            away from home before and I began to mope. My sister was kind and
            understanding and would suggest my taking walks and various things
            to arouse my interest. She said, "I know what's the matter with you,
            you are homesick." And so I was. There was a great, glad reunion
            when mother drove out with the horse and buggy to get me.
            Nevertheless, I look back on that visit as a very special and
            precious event. </p>
          <p>Now that I think harder about it, I believe it must have been the
            summer of 1910, for <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Peterson-6107">Irma</a>
            was toddling and calling her cat, "Teedle, Teedle, Teedle" whom no
            one else could ever coax up. Teedle would go to her and let her even
            use him for a pillow, but he would run from the rest of us. Maybe
            I'm mixed up about the dates, for no doubt I went back for
            subsequent visits.</p>
          <p>I remember going to some sort of a meeting at the Esdon house when
            Carrie has either Johnnie or Irma, a baby in arms. So did an Indian
            mother and Carrie and she compared their babies. It was my first
            experience in being that close to a real live Indian and I was
            really surprised and sort of proud of my brave, friendly sister.</p>
          <p>I must have been ten of maybe twelve years old when father built a
            "grist mill." He installed a large steam engine, dug a large
            cistern, and put in the machinery for a large mill. Farmers would
            come from miles around with loads of grain to be ground into feed
            for their livestock.</p>
          <p>In winter some would come, by way of our lake, driving over the
            ice. I would run over the frozen waters to meet them and ride back
            on their sleighs. (A sleigh ride is one of the most enjoyable means
            of transportation!)</p>
          <p><img src="contradance.svg" alt="Drawing of line dancing" style="width:20%;">The
            mill house was of considerable size. I'll just guess about twenty by
            forty feet. It was tw stories high. Father intended to have a
            workshop on its second floor and he laid a good floor in
            preparation. My brother, Edd, in his twenties, loved to dance And he
            persuaded our Father to let him invite the neighborhood young folks
            in for a dance. One neighbor, Knute Neshiem, was a good fiddler. His
            daughter, Bertha, could "call" the dances so a merry time was had.
            The girls would bring sandwiches and cake, so that the evening
            always ended with a feast. Mother always made plenty of coffee which
            was served with real cream. Such a good time was enjoyed that the
            "shop" never materialized. Hughey's Dance Hall was a favorite
            resort. Friday night was dance night. Saturday night would have been
            frowned upon as intruding into Sunday. </p>
          <p>In the summer time we quite often had a boy or two from town to
            come out for a few weeks to help n the farm and enjoy the country
            life. Then Mother would set up beds in the mill for the boys. My
            brothers liked to sleep up there. They coaxed our old dog. "Mac," to
            sleep with them. They thought that was fun until one rainy night
            when old Mac came in dripping wet and crawled into bed with them.
            After that poor old Mac was shut in the barn for his bedroom.</p>

              <p> It was customary for country teachers of that era to receive
                room and board as part of their meager compensation. Mary's
                father, Herbert Hughey, was an avid supporter of education and
                donated the land on which the was built. So it would have been
                convenient for the teacher to be housed there. And fortunate --
                from what Mary says about her mother's skill as a cook. But, it
                must have been very "cozy." Mary described the house as having
                four rooms, including a living room and the kitchen/dining room.
                So, in addition to the teacher, it would have housed Mary, her
                older brother and sister, plus her parents. It's easy to see why
                they added a "west bedroom."<a href="#Plate%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Camera-ref"

              <p>If you're curious about the real Julia, Mary Julia Wilson (1895
                - 1970) was a daughter of Superintendent James Alexander Wilson
                (1844 - 1927). This "city girl" was born in Brainerd and grew up
                in Brainerd, which by 1900 had a population of 7,524. She served
                as an Army nurse in WW1, later married William Earl McMahon and
                had 7 children. She died in St. Paul, MN. In spite of its size,
                Mary was correct in referring to Brainerd as a city, it was
                incorporated as one in 1881. Brainerd was larger than Moorehead,
                where she went to teachers college and may have been the largest
                community she had seen until later attending a teachers'
