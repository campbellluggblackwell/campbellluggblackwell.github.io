    <h1> Joseph DeForest Hoyt (1860 - 1903) </h1>
    <p class="western"> Joseph DeForest Hoyt was born Dec. 14, 1860, in
      Farmington Twp., Tioga Co., PA; d. Mar. 14, 1903 in Nelson Twp., Tioga Co.
      Married 1891 in Nelson to <a href="GoodrichFrances1871.html">Frances
        Viola "Frank" Goodrich</a>, b. Aug. 29, 1871, in Howard Co., IA; d. 1958
      in Binghamton, Broome Co., NY. Frank's parents were Rev. <span wc_id="I978">
        Henry David Goodrich</span>, born 1844 in Davenport, Delaware Co., NY,
      and <span wc_id="I979"> Elizabeth Batterham</span> (pronounced
      "BAT-trum"), born 1847 in Cass Twp., DuPage Co., IL. </p>
    <p class="western"> Joe was the elder of 2 children of <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">Phebe
        Campbell</a>, b. 1832 in Nelson, Tioga Co., PA, d. there in 1917; and <span
        wc_id="I1246"> William Hoyt</span>, born 1842 in CT, died 1888 in
      Nelson.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="western"> Joseph and Frances Goodrich Hoyt had three children, all
      born in Nelson: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> <span wc_id="I1250"> Jessica Phoebe Hoyt</span>, b. Aug. 14, 1892,
        m. <span wc_id="I1251"> Walter Frederick Thompson</span>; </li>
      <li> <span wc_id="I1276"> Elizabeth Hoyt</span>, b. Oct. 17, 1894, m. <span
          wc_id="I1277"> Lucian Roy Walker</span>; and </li>
      <li> <span wc_id="I1285"> Isabelle Merrill Hoyt</span>, b. Sep. 17, 1897,
        m. <span wc_id="I1286"> Thomas Lazelle Field</span>. </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="western"> Joe tried his hand at being a merchant, a R.R. agent,
      was the enumerator for the 1900 census of Nelson Twp., and was secretary
      of the school board --- but was primarily a farmer. He owned a hillside
      farm in Nelson Twp., bordering NYS, just west of his brother-in-law <span
        wc_id="I1292"> William Boller</span>'s farm. The latter straddled Strait
      Creek. </p>
    <p> He was president of the 1899 Campbell Reunion. He was hard working and
      ambitious. After his venture at being a merchant, he leased some river
      "bottom land" to grow tobacco --- cigar wrapper leaf -- the big cash crop
      in the area at the time. My impression is that the land he rented was from
      his 2nd cousin, once removed, <span wc_id="I2579"> Chas. B. Lugg</span>,
      and was part of the original farm of Joe's immigrant Great-grand-uncle, <a
        href="CampbellJohn1761.html">John Campbell</a>. Working two farms may
      have been too ambitions. His daughter Jessica said that Joe dropped dead
      of "apoplexy" (a term that was used for both heart attack and stroke)
      while working the tobacco field he'd rented, within sight of Lugg's
      tobacco shed -- but one of his obits said that he dies of heart failure
      (presumably a heart attack) by his barn. </p>
