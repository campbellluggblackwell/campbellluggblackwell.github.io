        Dear Campbell Cousins:-
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        Regardless of all my good intentions, I have waited longer than I
        intended before having this annual visit with you. So much has come
        into the lives of many of our circle since our last issue that I am
        waiting with much interest for the messages which will soon be ours to
        enjoy As <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin William</a> has asked
        us especially to mention the small as well as the greater experiences
        we have had during the year we certainly each must have a message.
        <span wc_id="I787">
        Lish</span> and myself returned from the Southland soon after my last
        letter - and we were a very busy pair for a time - adjusting ourselves
        to the very strenuous duties of house cleaning, gardening, etc. And
        after <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> -- enjoying
        our home and friends.
      </p>
<p>
        It was our privilege to attend the Campbell Reunion in August -
        motoring there with <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a> and
        <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">Frank</a>, who were at that time
        visiting friends in the North. To me it seemed one of the most
        enjoyable in many years, but we missed many faces that had greeted us
        in years past. Very soon after this we were called to Nelson to attend
        the funeral of Brother <span wc_id="I836">
        Will Ellison</span>, whose sudden going away was a great shock to all of
        us, and our sympathy went out to his family. The funeral was held in
        the Presbyterian Church, a place very sacred to us all, on account of
        early associations. I wandered back to the seat my <a href="CampbellWilliam1822.html">father</a> and <span wc_id="I767">
        mother</span> and us children occupied together, Oh, so long ago, and
        paused in reverence - my mind was so filled with past memories. We went
        home with sister <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">Mary Shipman</a> that
        night as she was not well and we were very anxious over her condition.
        Soon after she had a most serious operation, and how grateful we all
        are that she is quite well again and enjoying another winter with
        Tommie and Frank in Florida.
      </p>
<p>
        The next big event was the annual Cousins Dinner at the home of Cousins
        <span wc_id="I1470">
        Will</span> and <a href="TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie Clark</a>, in
        Osceola, Pa. It was a most joyous occasion - many Cousins coming a long
        distance to be present and others even closing up their business places
        to enjoy the occasion. Cousin <span wc_id="I1605">
        Doris Selph</span> who was so soon to change her name looked very happy
        and we enjoyed her so much, but we missed many faces whose presence
        would have gladdened our hearts. Brother<span class="Annotation">[s]</span> <a href="CampbellWilliam1864.html">Will</a> and
        Tommie and sister Mary, were all spoken of, as well as others who were
        missed.
      </p>
<p>
        I think most of you know that we were called here in November, 1925, on
        account of the serious illness of <span wc_id="I815">
        Nellie</span>,-making the journey in five days, with a change of trains
        once - which was in Chicago<sup>1</sup>. She was very ill for many
        weeks, but thanks to a kind Providence she was spared to us, and is now
        quite herself again. Since her recovery
      </p>

        1. At that time it was not possible to travel thru Chicago by train
        from West to East (or East to West) without changing trains.

        we have been having a most delightful time at <span wc_id="I828">
        Arthur</span>'s - <span wc_id="I790">
        Frank</span>'s and here with <span wc_id="I816">
        Clark</span> and Nellie. The climate in some respects is much like Florida
        - vegetation grows and flowers bloom all during the winter months.
        There has been no snow here this winter, but at all times we can see
        the snow capped peaks of many mountains, Mount Hood, Mt. Jefferson and
        others. The past week Clark, Nellie, Lish and I motored to Newport, a
        popular winter resort on the Pacific coast, near here where people were
        enjoying surf bathing and the sun was so hot we found a shady corner to
        watch the white caps on the Pacific Ocean. We spent several weeks at
        FrankY's home in Portland, which was a wonderful privilege, From there
        I had a most delightful trip to Tacoma and spent a week at the home of
        Cousins <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a> and <a href="VaughanEmma1854.html">Em Congdon</a>, a privilege I had long coveted.
        The trip was one never to be forgotten for the scenery. The broad
        Columbia River, the immense lumbering districts - covering acres of
        ground and the waters of Puget Sound, dotted with large sea-faring
        vessels, with Mount Ranier snow capped in the distance, -- made a
        picture long to be remembered. But the best was yet to come, - Cousin
        Ed and his son, <span wc_id="I947">
        Lee</span>, a fine Cousin whom you would lie to know, met us at the
        station and we drove to his home where Cousin Em stood ready to welcome
        us. Nothing which could add to the to the pleasure f my visit was left
        undone. One of the pleasant events was a one o'clock luncheon given by
        Cousin Em in honor of my birthday, February 25th. A large number of her
        friends were invited and her daughter, <span wc_id="I941">
        Georgia</span> and <span wc_id="I942">
        husband</span> came all the way from Harper, Washington, to be present. I
        returned to Portland for a time - then back here to Independence, to
        find that during my absence a darling little girl, <span wc_id="I830">
        Dora Grace</span> - had come to gladden the hearts and home of Arthur - a
        beautiful child - which we trust may be a great comfort to them.

<span wc_id="I820">
        Faith</span> is home from college for her Easter vacation, a most
        interesting girl - full of college life and enthusiastic over her
        work<sup>2</sup>. We have missed her in the home.
      </p>
<p>
        The sad news has just reached us of Cousin <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil Young</a>'s untimely death, and has cast a
        gloom over us. We remember him best when he and <span wc_id="I1493">
        Cousin Lou</span> - who was a favorite of us all - came often to <a href="CampbellJohn1836.html">Uncle John</a>'s with their children to enjoy
        family gatherings. Our deepest sympathy goes out to each member of his
        family. We will miss him from our circle.
      </p>
<p>
        We will leave here very soon, for Baker, 300 miles toward
        home<sup>3</sup> and spend several weeks at <span wc_id="I822">
        Harry</span>'s home. This will be another pleasure - then we must hike for
        home, and get busy after a delightful winter spent in the homes of our
        children, each one of whom joins us in sending love to all the Campbell
        Cousins.
