          <span wc_id="I95">
      Robert Campbell</span>, one of the oldest residents of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elkland,_Pennsylvania">this borough</a>,
      died at his home on West Main street yesterday morning at about 5
      o'clock, in the seventy-seventh year of his age. The cause of death was
      cancer of the stomach.<br/>
          Robert Campbell was the son of <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James Campbell</a>, a pioneer of Nelson borough,
      formerly known as <a href="BeechersIsland.html">Beecher [sic] Island</a>,
      and had resided there for more sixty years until his removal to Elkland,
      where he was residing at the time of his death. He was married to Miss
      <span wc_id="I1614">
      Emma Selling</span> of Reading, N. Y., about 1850, by whom he had three
      children who survive him, viz: <span wc_id="I1636">
      Charles Campbell</span>, now living in the west; <span wc_id="I1615">
      Mrs. Eaton</span>, living at Nelson, and <span wc_id="I1674">
      Mrs. Baldwin</span>, of Williamsport, who, with her husband were with him at
      the time of his death, Two of his brothers, <span wc_id="I100">
      E. B.</span> and <span wc_id="I103">
      J. C. Campbell</span>, live in Elkland, and his other brother, <span wc_id="I101">
      Joseph</span>, living in Arizona, while his one sister, <span wc_id="I97">
      Mrs. D. C. Kemp</span> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmington_Township,_Tioga_County,_Pennsylvania">
      Farmington</a>, survive. His first wife died in 1889 and he married
      <span wc_id="I448">
      Mrs. P. Crandall</span>, a sister of his first wife, who survives
      him. <br/>
          For more than forty years, Mr. Campbell had been a
      consistent and active member of the M. E. Church and when the final
      summons came it found him ready to obey and willing to depart. All his
      years he has an active, busy life and was well and favorably known in
      this and adjoining counties, where he will be missed but not
      forgotten.<br/>
          The funeral will be held at the house tomorrow
      (Friday) at 2 o'clock p. m., conducted by Rev. T. C. Easson, and burial
      at the Nelson cemetery.<br/>
