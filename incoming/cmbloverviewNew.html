<big><big><big><big style="font-weight: bold;">How Do Our Campbells,

      Interconnect?</big><br/></big></big></big>
</div><br/>
<big><big><big>There are many intermarriages throughout the generations,
    but here are the early connections. There's lots of overlap in the family
    trees. Below are selected parts of the trees: first from the CAMPBELLs'
    viewpoint; then from the LUGG perspective; BLACKWELLs' next; then from the
    HAZLETT perspective. For simplicity, only the children that "interconnect"
    are shown. "Sr." and "Jr." were not usually used as part of the names
    below, but are added to help distinguish father from son, where both have
    the same name.<br/>
<br/>
    [Note the longevity of many of these folks. Infant and child mortality was
    high, but for those who reached adulthood, a surprising percent lived to
    "ripe old age".]</big><br/>

<big>We haven't been able to trace our Campbells farther back than Joseph
    Campbell, born 1748 in Scotland, died 1822 in Nelson, Tioga Co., PA and his
    brother, <a href="CampbellJohn1761.html">John Campbell</a>, born Apr 3,
    1761 in Scotland, died Mar 20, 1855, in Nelson. We do not know where in
    Scotland they were born, nor where in Scotland Mary Harper was born.<br/>
<br/>
    John Campbell (b. 1761) was the apparently first of the family to come to
    America, probably in 1776. He worked as a tailor in Philadelphia and later
    as a land agent. Next to come were some of Joseph's older children. They
    initially settled in Lancaster Co., PA. We don't know exactly when they
    arrived, but Sam and Sally Campbell Hazlett's first child, <span wc_id="I38">
    Archibald</span>, was born in Lancaster Co. in 1803. Joseph Campbell, wife
    Mary Harper, and their younger children lived in N. Ireland for about 10
    years before sailing from Londonderry to Perth Amboy, NJ in 1810.<br/>
<br/>
    John Campbell married a widow, <a href="LuggSarah1778.html">Sarah
    LUGG</a> Clinch Blackwell in 1818. Sarah Lugg was born in Bisley,
    Gloucestershire, abt. 1777. Sarah first married <span wc_id="I20">
    Thomas Clinch</span> and had a daughter, <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann
    Clinch</a>, b. 1804 in Avening, Gloucestershire. In 1804 Sarah, Thomas and
    infant Ann sailed from Bristol to Philadelphia. On board was a widower,
    <a href="BlackwellEnoch1764ca.html">Enoch Blackwell</a> (also from Avening,
    born there about 1764) his children, and several of his siblings. In 1805,
    Thomas Clinch died in NYC of yellow fever. Soon after, Sarah and Enoch
    married. According to Ann's daughter <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Jane
    CAMPBELL Tubbs</a> (1834 - 1916), Ann was given to Enoch's brother <span wc_id="I2682">
    Peter Blackwell</span> and raised near New Hope, PA. But the late <span wc_id="I2956">
    Stella MAUGERI Blackwell</span>, a Blackwell family researcher, believed Ann
    was raised by brother <span wc_id="I2677">
    Joshua Blackwell</span>, not Peter.<br/>
<br/>
    Sarah and Enoch lived in Lycoming Co., PA, where their two children were
    born: <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary Blackwell</a> in 1806, and
    <a href="BlackwellEnoch1814.html">Enoch</a> in 1814. Enoch "Sr." died in
    1816. After Sarah married John Campbell in 1818 and John, Sarah, Mary, and
    Enoch "Jr." lived in Nelson. In 1821 Sarah decided two of John's nephews
    would make good husbands for her daughters. She wrote to Ann Clinch,
    inviting her to come to Nelson to marry <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph Campbell</a> "Jr." Daughter Mary Blackwell
    married <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James Campbell</a>. The two sets
    of siblings married a week apart in 1822.</big><br/>

<big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Both Sarah Lugg,
    mentioned above, and later her brother, Charles Byron Lugg, b. 1791 in
    Bisley, came to America. She was the eldest, and he the 6th, of Robert and
    Mary Ann Lugg's 7 children. Sarah Lugg's 3rd husband was John Campbell.
    Sarah's daughters (Ann Clinch and Mary Blackwell) married John's nephews
    Joseph and James Campbell. Sarah's son, Enoch Blackwell "Jr." married three
    times. His second wife was his first cousin, Caroline Lugg. Caroline was
    the mother of his only child, Enoch Charles Blackwell, b. 1867. Enoch
    Blackwell "Jr." was the heir of his step-father, John Campbell. We have
    several generations of Robert Lugg's ancestry.</big><br/>

<big>The elder Enoch Blackwell's tree is embedded in the LUGG tree above,
    except for his first marriage. Enoch Blackwell, b. abt. 1764 in Avening,
    Gloucestershire first married <span wc_id="I27">
    Hannah Perrine</span>, who died in Gloucestershire before he emigrated. They
    had 7 children, at least 5 of whom came to America with Enoch. Enoch was
    from a family of 10 children. At least 3 of his siblings came to America:
    <span wc_id="I2636">
    Thomas</span>, <span wc_id="I2677">
    Joshua</span>, and <span wc_id="I2682">
    Peter</span>. We have several generations of Enoch's ancestry. Enoch "Sr." was
    Sarah Lugg's 2nd husband, and had two children by her: Mary Blackwell (who
    married James Campbell) and Enoch Blackwell, who married 3 times.</big><br/>

    b. 1777, and Jane, b. 1792 married brothers Samuel, b. 1780, and John, b.
    abt. 1787, both in Scotland. We know their father's name, and two of their
    siblings, but do not know their birthplace. Mary Campbell, b. 1779, never
    came to Nelson. She too married a John Hazlett, but in Lancaster, PA. He
    was born 1783 in County Down, Ireland. As far as we know, he was not
    related to the other Hazletts. The children of John and Mary moved to
    Allegheny Co., PA to be with the families of Mary's brother, John Campbell,
    b. 1781. Sam Hazlett's <span wc_id="I14338">
    mother</span>, his sister <span wc_id="I3437">
    Mary</span>, and his brother, <span wc_id="I18">

    Hazletts he is.<br/>

    HISTORY'S MYSTERIES.<br/>
    The story of Sarah Lugg and Ann Clinch has always intrigued
    me.</big></big></big>
<ul>
<li>
<big><big><big>Why did Sarah Lugg give baby daughter Ann Clinch to one
        of Enoch Blackwell's brothers to raise?</big></big></big><br/>
</li>
<li>
<big><big><big>Did Ann and Sarah ever see each other from the time of
        Sarah's 2nd marriage?</big></big></big><br/>
</li>
<li>
<big><big><big>Did they correspond?</big></big></big><br/>
</li>
<li>
<big><big><big>Why did Sarah feel that Ann should marry her nephew,
        Joseph Campbell (the younger)?</big></big></big><br/>
</li>
<li>
<big><big><big>How did Ann feel about Sarah's matchmaking? Was she
        reluctant to leave the well established communities around New Hope,
        Bucks Co., PA, or adjacent Lambertville, Hunterdon Co., NJ, for
        Beecher's Island --- which was still the wild
        frontier?<br/></big></big></big>
</li>
<li>
<big><big><big>How did Ann's foster parents feel about her departure
        knowing they would probably never see her again?</big></big></big>
</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<big><big><big></big></big></big>
</li>
<li>
<big>How did Joseph feel about being sent to New Hope to court his

</ul>
