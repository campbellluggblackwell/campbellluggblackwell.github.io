        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        It is time for another letter from each one of us to all the rest of
        us. We have been reminded by the various officials of our
        organization<sup>1</sup> to be on time, so I can put it off no longer.
        I have been looking over the October letters thinking perchance I might
        get inspiration and as we look at a beautiful picture again and again,
        each time discovering some new beauty, I seemed to read in the letters
        an added value and many fine thoughts I had not noticed before; and the
        thought comes to me that we ought to write carefully and thoughtfully
        for these letters will be read long after we are gone. Think how
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we</span> would prize letters
        like these written by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">our</span> parents; they would have been
        invaluable to us.<br/>
</p>
<p>
        When we wrote our last letters, a long winter was before us. I think
        perhaps a few of us rather dreaded its approach; but the time has
        slipped away, just one day at a time, each day, I trust, filled with
        our best endeavors; and now before we hardly know it, spring is here.
        Of those who wrote last October, not one has been parted from us by
        death.
      </p>
<p>
        We will all miss <span wc_id="I1708">
        Emma Parks</span> from our gatherings and most sincerely sympathize with
        <span wc_id="I1707">
        Cousin Jim</span>; a few of us know by experience the bitterness of his
        sorrow.
      </p>
<p>
        With me the winter has passed uneventfully. Have had two or three colds
        and must confess I begin to feel some of the infirmities of age, but
        even so, I am coming along pretty well. One of the pleasures of the
        winter has been the frequent visits of <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Brother Charlie</a>. Would that I might see
        <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a> oftener.
      </p>
<p>
        Just after Thanksgiving, Charlie and I went to Mansfield<sup>2</sup>,
        then from there to Nelson, then to Elmira<sup>3</sup> and home to
        Watkins. I did not want to go. Said I did not feel able, but he just
        made me go with him; he said I he knew it would not hurt me at all.
        After we reached home, he did not ask me if I had enjoyed the trip, so
        I did not tell him; but if he had asked, I should have said, "Yes, I've
        had a splendid time everywhere."

        I think to many of us, there is no place quite like the old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowanesque_River">Cowanesque Valley</a>.
        As Cousin Jessie<sup>4</sup> said at one of the Re-unions, "Nelson, our
        meeting place, until we join those gone on before."
      </p>
<p>
        Charley has visited me three times since; we talk about everyone of
        you, maybe criticize you a little, but we love you all just the same.
      </p>
<p>
        Here in Watkins, I belong to two or three small organizations and in
        attending them, I get great pleasure and I trust some profit. I greatly
        enjoy the Church; and the Bible Class, which consists of women about my
        own age. I like what Mary Hughey says in regard to "conviction of
        sin."<sup>5</sup> A little thought along this line might be good for us
        all.
      </p>
<p>
        I have a high school girl who has been with me nearly two years. She is
        a fine young girl and I enjoy having her with me.
      </p>
<p>
        Suppose I will spend most of the summer in New Jersey with my children
        as I did last year.
      </p>
<p>
        Anticipating great pleasure in reading the next number of our letters
        and hoping to meet you at Marshall Falls this Fall<sup>6</sup>, I am

        4. It's hard to be certain which 'Jessie' Emma was quoting. It might
        possibly have been <span wc_id="I835">
        Jessie CAMPBELL</span> Ellison, but the Campbell Reunions didn't start
        until 1894, and she died in 1900. Emma may have been referring to my
        mother, <span wc_id="I1250">
        Jessica HOYT</span> Thompson who attended some of the more recent
        reunions.

        6. That year, the "Cousins Dinner" (which was originally only for the
        grandchildren of <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph</a> &amp;
        <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann Clinch</a> Campbell and invited guests
        had recently been expanded to include the next generation) was held
        that year in Marshall Falls (near Stroudsburg, PA), at the summer home
        of Cousin Charlie Congdon. That was the only time a Cousins Dinner was
        held so far away from Nelson. Cousin <span wc_id="I1057">
        Laura BOSARD</span> Mowrey held an alternate dinner, for those who
        couldn't, or didn't want to, travel to Charlie's. "Cousins Dinners"
        were held in the fall. "Campbell Reunions", which were for everyone,
        were held in the summer.
