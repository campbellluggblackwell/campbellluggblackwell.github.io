            <p><img src="PassengerTrain.svg" alt="Drawing of diesel engine pulling passenger train"

                style="width:20%;">After we retired, we bought a
              home at Jamestown Bay, about six miles from Sitka. There we lived
              until 1964. In the spring of that year, we went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Rupert,_British_Columbia">Prince
                Rupert</a>, where we boarded the train, starting what we
              supposed would be a long and interesting trip across southern
              Canada as far as Quebec, then heading south down the entire east
              cost of the United States, until we came to Florida. Then we
              planned to traverse across the southern boundary of the United
              States until we reached California. We would go north up the west
              coast until we reached Washington. Then, likely in Seattle, we
              planned to board a ship, taking us back to Sitka, Alaska. </p>
            <p>After we were on the train, leaving Prince Rupert, I noticed
              something was wrong with George. His speech became mumbled. I
              could hardly understand him. He also lost the power of his left
              arm and hand. He was having a stroke! We had to remain on the
              train until we reached <a hewf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithers,_British_Columbia">Smithers</a>
              in British Columbia. There I had to take him from the train and
              put him in Smithers Hospital where he stayed for two weeks. The
              doctor there was fine and George received wonderful care. We were
              able to contact our Sitka Dr. Spencer by telephone and we were
              able to make arrangements to return to Sitka. My niece, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/O%27Hare-303">
                Marie Taylor</a>, came from Portland. Oregon to help me and she
              traveled with us from Smithers, then to Prince Rupert and by ferry
              boat back to Sitka. George was an invalid for several weeks, but
              out relatives in Tacoma thought we should make every effort to
              come down there.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#TacomaRelatives"></a>
              So, we sold our home in Jamestown Bay, went to Tacoma and bought a
              nice little brick house in Tacoma. </p>
            <p>We were not city people and when we found we could buy a
              semi-country place seven miles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Townsend,_Washington">Port
                Townsend, Washington</a>, we made the move to that location, to
              a two acre place, partly wooded, having a comfortable house, a
              guest house in the back yard, a good garage, a green house, and a
              fine garden and the added advantage of being in what was known as
              the "banana belt," for it had far less rainfall than surrounding
              areas. It was so because the Washington Rain Forest lay directly
              west and much rain fell there and our area only had something like
              ten inches per year. </p>
            <p>There I lived for ten years in this area named <a href="https://www.ghosttowns.com/states/wa/irondale.html">Irondale</a>.
              George was with me six of those ten years. Then he went to be with
              the Lord. I lived on there four more years as a widow. </p>
            <p> A hurricane which came to a large part of Washington, took the
              Hood Canal Bridge, also did considerable damage in our area. It
              took my greenhouse, turned it upside down, and demolished it. </p>
            <p>I decided that as I was a widow, it would be best for me to to to
              a retirement home. I had been doing some thinking along that line.
              A dear friend of mine lived at Exeter House in Seattle and at her
              invitation, I visited her there. <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11189503/katherine-ethel-whitener">Katherine
                Whitener</a> and her husband had been missionaries in Japan.
              They had come to Albuquerque, bought a home on the outskirts of
              that city. George and I became good friends with Reverend and Mrs.
              Whitener. We did many things together. </p>
            <p><img src="ExeterHouse.png" alt="Photo of Exeter House" style="width:20%;">After
              Mr. Whetener died, Katherine had decided to live at Exeter House.
              I visited her there and so became interested in Exeter House as a
              retirement community. Finally, I made definite plans to go to
              Exeter. </p>
            <p>On December 6, 1978, I was put on the preferred waiting list and
              I paid $1,000. On July 26, 1979, my application was approved. On
              the last day of July and the first day of August, I moved from
              Irondale, helped by Clair Doig and by one of my Irondale
              neighbors. Guy Rudolph, so that I got settled in August 1979 in
              apartment #802. In July 1980 I paid the difference and moved from
              #802 to the double apartment, #212-214. Reverend <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8543436/henry-h-fawcett">Henry
                Fawcett</a> and Jeff Bullock helped me move. I lived in that
              apartment until the fall of 1985 when I moved to apartment #316. </p>
            <p>I have left out so much of my story. So many varied and
              interesting things have happened. During my days at Menaul School
              in Albuquerque, probably the most time consuming, so a bit of that
              later.</p>
            <p>Here my story ends, unless I recall some incidents which I may
              add. No, I can't end abruptly here. So to go back over some of the
              years. </p>
            <p>One of the most important parts of my life was likely while I was
              still in Albuquerque at Menaul School. For a large part of my life
              there were the years when the Board of National Missions used me
              for promotional work and I was sent all over the United States,
              usually in the spring of the year when Presbyterial Societies met.<a

                aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#Presbyteries"></a> So, I
              was used as a speaker in South Dakota, North Dakota, Michigan,
              Kentucky, Nebraska, Ohio, Kansas, Tennessee, California, Illinois,
              Minnesota and even Washington. I remember I spoke to Washington. I
              remember I spoke to Washington women in 1942 at their meeting of
              Presbyterial in First Presbyterian Church in Seattle. Those days
              of 1939, 1940, 1942, 1946, etc. were days of travel by train. I
              enjoyed train travel. (Now I don't even go to downtown Seattle
              unless I have a companion to accompany me.)</p>
            <p>I should have written about our days in the Indian village of <a

                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metlakatla,_Alaska">
                Metlakatha</a>, where for nine months George took care of the
              Presbyterian Church. Then our days in Sitka, Alaska were memorable
              when we were at Sheldon Jackson School.</p>
            <p>My life has been a busy and eventful one and I am sure I have
              left out much that I may want to add later.</p>

              area -- descendants of her brother Harry and descendants of Herb's
              1st cousin, Thomas Edgar "Ed" Congdon. The Congdons moved from
              Nelson, PA to Brainerd, and then to Tacoma. Ed Congdon's daughter,
              Georgia, was a business partner of Mary's brother, Edd Hughey. </li>
            <li id="Presbyteries">Since Presbyterianism came to the America in
              the 1630s there have been a number of schisms and mergers. There
              are now several denominations calling themselves 'Presbyterian'
              the largest being "The Presbyterian Church (USA)." All have
              similar organizational governance. At the lowest level are
              individual congregations, each governed by a "Session," made up of
              elected elders plus the minister. A bunch of congregations in a
              geographical area are grouped together in a "Presbytery" in which
              representatives of the member congregations meet annually to
              conduct business and to ordain ministers. </li>
