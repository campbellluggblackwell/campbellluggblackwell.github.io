            <p>In the fall of 1929 I made a real change. One day I said to the
              minister of our Presbyterian Church, "You know I have always
              wanted to be a missionary." Reverend Patterson said, "Why don't
              you be one?" I replied that I was sure I was too old, thinking I
              would have to take out some time for Bible study and training.
              Reverend Patterson replied that he felt confident I could apply to
              one of our mission schools and be accepted. He assured me that he
              realized I had been faithful in our church and had taken part in
              much Bible study. He encouraged me to apply to our Board of
              National Missions, saying he would also write to them and was
              given a chance to go to the Menaul School in Albuquerque, New
              Mexico. Menaul was a high school for Spanish speaking boys from
              the little Spanish towns or plazas in Northern New Mexico. </p>
            <p>I was assigned to what was called the sixth grade. It was the
              opportunity grade for boys who were not quite ready for high
              school. </p>
            <p>It was an experience for me, full of many new activities. I had
              never seen a mountain. Albuquerque was surrounded by mountains and
              was nearly a mile high in elevation. Not only was the landscape
              different, I soon learned many other new things. </p>
            <p>The food at Menual was mainly what I was used to, but I soon
              learned that "chili" was a common dish and enjoyed by all. It was
              made of beans and meat seasoned by hot chili peppers. The beans
              were very diff erent. My mother had always used the small white
              navy beans. The beans they used in New Mexico were small, mottled
              brown beans called pinto beans. I really learned to like and
              appreciate them. Not only were they delicious, but they were
              cooked easily - a slow cooking, perhaps overnight. </p>
            <p>Menaul had a large campus, about 300 acres. The school had a herd
              of Holstein cows. There was a large garden, fields of alfalfa, and
              to my delight, a fair sized peach orchard. </p>
            <p>The school was right on the edge of Albuequerque. Eighteen miles
              east were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandia_Mountains">
                Sandia Mountains</a>. One could see a group of extinct volcanoes
              on the west or one could see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Taylor_%28New_Mexico%29">Mt.
                Taylor</a>. Then, in contrast, the great American desert was
              beginning on the western horizon. </p>
            <p>I had studied Latin in Brainerd High School and I found that the
              Spanish language, which our school boys used, had many Latin
              derivatives.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#RomanceLanguages"></a>
              I began to "pick up" a few words. Of course, only English was used
              in our school. </p>
            <p>I was given a room in "Teachers Hall" where the single teachers
              lived. The married faculty members had their own homes on the
              campus. </p>
            <p>I soon found that the climate and altitude made a difference in
              my living. Bronchitis, a real trouble at times in Minnesota, left
              me.Then came the sand storms in New Mexico which affected my
              breathing a bit so sinusitis was a new trouble. On the whole,
              though, I really enjoyed the new and different climate. </p>
            <p>I was not the only new worker that fall at Menaul School. Among
              the new workers was a man from California who had been employed to
              be the new "shop teacher." He was to teach the boys in carpentry,
              learning how to handle all the tools of that trade. Other trades,
              also, were added.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#Asimilation">
              </a></p>
            <p>One thing that really developed was the study and care of
              automobiles. Friends of the school began to leave their cars for
              the boys to work on. Some became regular customers t our school
              auto shop. Welding became a new and popular trade to learn. The
              school had a forge to use in the machine shop, so that iron was
              heated and shaped on the big iron tables with sledge hammers. I
              got very well acquainted with the new shop teacher. He was a
              graduate of the <a href="https://pcad.lib.washington.edu/building/17832/">
                Bible Institute of Los Angeles</a>, an institute that I had been
              very interested in. </p>
            <p>To make an interesting part of my life story short, I must tell
              you that <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Prescott-1907">
                H. George Prescott</a> and I met in August. We became engaged in
              October. the next June we traveled to Minnesota to be married in
              the Presbyterian Church of Brainerd, Minnesota.</p>
            <p>The&nbsp; Reverend William J. Lowrie from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windom,_Minnesota">Windom,
                Minnesota</a>, came to officiate at the marriage ceremony. The
              Lowries had been friends of mine since my early teenage days.
              Reverend Alexander Patterson, the minister of the Brainerd
              Presbyterian Church, assisted. My niece. Irma Anderson was the
              maid of honor. Twelve year old Elizabeth Lowrie was my junior
              bridesmaid. My train bearer was the the tiny daughter of Mr. and
              Mrs. Alfred Dillon. The Dillons were dear old friends from high
              school days, that is Alfred was. Mrs. Dillon or Dorothy and I
              didn't become acquainted after she married Alfred. </p>
            <p>George and I headed west after our marriage. We visited my
              brother Edd and family in Lewiston, Montana. We also spent a night
              in Yellowstone National Park. We finally came to Fort Collins,
              Colorado, where George enrolled for the summer term at Colorado
              State College. He studied farm and shop mechanics there. </p>
            <p>Back in Albuquerque, George took several night courses in the
              University of New Mexico. By taking extension courses at the
              University of New Mexico and by returning for another summer term
              at Colorado State College, he received a Bachelor's Degree from
              both schools. </p>
            <p>We lived and worked at Menaul School in Albuquerque for twenty
              years. Then we left to go to Sitka, Alaska to work at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/places/sheldon-jackson-school.htm">Sheldon
                Jackson School</a>. </p>
            <p>George became a teacher of carpentry there from 1950 to 1960 when
              he reached retirement.</p>

            <li id="RomanceLanguages">Latin was spoken throughout all the
              Western Roman Empire prior to the fall of Rome. After the fall,
              regional dialects gradually evolved into distinct languages. Which
              is why Catalan, French, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, etc. are
              called "romance languages," i.e. evolved from Rome's Latin.&nbsp;

            <li id="Assimilation">Presbyterian minister Rev. James Menaul opened
              the "Albuquerque Indian School" in 1881, operating under a
              contract from the federal Indian Bureau. The goal of those schools
              was assimilation. That philosophy was often stated as "Kill the
              Indian; save the child." In 1886, the government took over
              operating the mission schools, and the Presbyterians opened their
              own Indian school on a 200 acre site on what is now Manaul Blvd.
              It closed in 1890, but in 1895 Rev. Manaul reopened the campus as
              a school for Spanish speaking boys, the first class recruited from
              Las Vegas, NM. </li>
