        <h4>NOTES:</h4>
        <i>
          <p> [As you can see in the Relationship Chart above, Jessica Thompson
            and E. C. Essex are related via John and Elizabeth Lucas Clinch. E.
            C. Essex was a 2nd cousin of Jessica's grandmother, Phebe CAMPBELL
            Hoyt -- so she and the canon were second cousins two times removed.
            Mabel SHIPMAN Shaw, Jos. W. Buck &amp; Eva HOOKER Hills were also
            his 2nd cousins two times removed. (And Jessica, Eva, Mabel &amp;
            Joe were all 2nd cousins to each other.) </p>
          <p>This was the first of several visits from Cousin Claude, continuing
            through the 1950s. In between visits, I corresponded with him. Two
            of her cousins, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Buck-5990">Joseph
              Wallace Buck</a> and <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel
              SHIPMAN</a> Shaw, made contact with him, and after the war, Joe
            Buck thew a large party, at the famous Brown's Hotel in London, for
            Claude, his siblings, their spouses and their children (and perhaps
            grandchildren). And Joe's daughter, Cornelia BUCK Key, met with
            members of the Essex family while she was living in England in the
            postwar years. </p>
          <p> I was a preteen on Cousin Claude's first visit and a teenager on
            his subsequent visits. We had many conversations and corresponded
            after he returned to England. For a while I engaged in an e-mail
            correspondence with Pamela BATES Essex, wife of a
            great-great-grandson of Peter Clinch Essex, but lost touch with her,
            and as of the moment (April 2022), to the best of my knowledge, the
            descendants of Peter Clinch Essex and the descendants of Ann CLINCH
            Campbell are not in contact. That's too bad. Peter Clinch Essex was
            always invited to our Campbell Reunions but was never able to come
            to Pennsylvania to attend. <b>I hope that contact can be
              re-established and some of Peter's descendants can join us via
              ZOOM, Aug 6, 2022 for this year's Campbell Reunion.</b></p>
          <p>And, of course, I knew Cousin Eva HOOKER Hills, who lived in the
            adjacent community of Johnson, City, NY. She, and her husband, Ed
            Hills, son "Junior" and his wife, Virginia were frequent visitors at
            out house. And, for a couple of years, I later lived just 2 blocks
            from Eva's house, so she was a familiar face and voice.</p>
          <p>When I visited England in 2000, I planed to visit Ely Cathedral.
            But while on the train to Ely, discovered that the train stations
            lockers, where I'd planned to store our luggage while touring the
            cathedral, were closed due to a bomb scare, and settled for just
            seeing the cathedral from the train. It rises high above the
            surrounding marshlands, so you can see it for miles. We proceeded to
            Cambridge, where we succeeded in seeing the church he'd been vicar
            of, and his college. And, I got to check off an item on my "bucket
            list."</p>
          <p>Growing up in Binghamton I had my own canoe. Poling was the most
            efficient way of ascending the Susquehanna's many, shallow riffles
            and I became good at poling, standing up in my canoe. So when I saw
            picture of "punting on the River Cam" (which is done using poles,
            not paddles or oars, I though "I bet I could do that," and hoped to
            someday have a chance. So, being in Cambridge on a nice day and with
            a free afternoon, I was determined to give it a try. I rented a punt
            and took it out solo. The punts are fairly long and heavy, and the
            poles were much longer and much heavier than I'd expected. It took a
            few minutes to get the hang of it (especially going under the low
            bridges), but I soon was doing well and had a great time seeing the
            university from the river -- much more scenic and serene than from
            the busy streets. And got a lot of satisfaction from telling myself
            "I did it."<i> - wbt]</i></p>
