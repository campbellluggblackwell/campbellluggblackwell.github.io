        Dear Parents, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        I know you are anxious to hear from me as soon a possible so I will
        write this morning. We<sup>1</sup> got here all right and sound. Got
        here yesterday about 2:00 P.M. Would have got here sooner but was
        delayed in Buffalo the same night we started. We arrived about 12:00
        midnight and had to stay there about four hours in consequence of a
        smash up near Rochester on the other road. As we were delayed in
        Buffalo we stayed here all night. I was not sorry for we was tired
        enough to rest. We got a good room at the Washington Hotel and left
        there at 10:10 Wednesday morning.
      </p>We have had a nice trip and seen a good deal of country and come
      through a pile of cities. I am happily disappointed in the country of
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainerd,_Minnesota">Brainerd</a>.
      It is quite level here.
      <p>
        This morning I have been through the RR Shops with <a href=
        "CongdonThomas1850.html">Tom Congdon</a>.<sup>2</sup> Stayed in the
        store last night with <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie</a>.
        Today I am going to get out to the river.<sup>3</sup> There seems to be
        a lot of business here. I probably won't get work this week. I won't
        try to write much this morning only I am well and have felt well
        throughout the trip with the exception of the night we got to Chicago.
        There I had a slight touch of the headache.

        1. "We" -- It's not known who else was traveling with Herb from Nelson,
        PA to Brainerd, MN.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Herb had grown up in Nelson with his older 1st cousins, Thomas
        Edward Congdon (later know as Edward T. Congdon or just Ed Congdon and
        Charles H. Congdon. Ed moved to Brainerd in 1872 and worked as a
        painter for the Northern Pacific RR and was later promoted to foreman.
        Several of Ed's Congdon cousins had also moved to Brainere before
        Herb's arrival. Charlie Congdon was only a year older than Herb, but
        waited till graduating from Mansfield Normal School in 1876 before
        moving to Brainerd to teach.
