        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        Very soon now we on the Pacific Coast will receive your interesting
        letters. To us, you know, they are letters "from home". Since the
        coming of the first Campbell book, I feel that I know you all much
        better. The letters take me back to the happy visits <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel</a> and I used to have at Uncle <a href="CampbellJoseph1839.html">Joe Campbell</a>'s and Uncle <a href="CampbellJohn1836.html">John Campbell</a>'s and with the Aunts. We
        would take our little bags and visit the length of the valley, with a
        generous stay at <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Uncle Tommie</a>'s
        and <span wc_id="I835">
        Aunt Jessie</span>'s. Those were very happy times which our memory now
        treasures.
      </p>
<p>
        Of course the great occasion of the past year with us was the visit of
        <span wc_id="I773">
        Llewellyn</span> and Mabel. Every day of their stay was a gala day and
        will be a happy memory until they come again. We celebrated their
        twenty-fifth and our twenty-seventh wedding anniversaries at our home
        with a dinner. <span wc_id="I790">
        Frank</span> and <span wc_id="I828">
        Arthur</span> and family were with us, so we really had a Cousins Reunion
        of our own. It had been many years since we had all been together and
        it was indeed a great pleasure.
      </p>
<p>
<span wc_id="I820">
        Faith Jean</span> has just returned to the University after spending the
        spring vacation here. She is well and enjoys her work there. We are
        fortunate to be living so near Eugene - we often drive down for the
        day. The State Editorial Conference was held there last month. We
        attended it and also visited Faith.
      </p>
<p>
        Spring here, and the valley<sup>1</sup> is a mass of bloom. Almond,
        cherry, peach and prune trees are loaded with blossoms, and next Sunday
        is Blossom Day. The highways will be crowded with cars driving from one
        large orchard to another to feast on their beauty.
      </p>
<p>
        I think <span wc_id="I787">
        Father</span> and <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Mother</a> will be going
        home soon. They have had the most delightful winter one could imagine.
        Uncle Tommie and <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">Aunt Frank</a> have
        certainly given worlds of pleasure to them, and we who are so far from
        them do appreciate it. Uncle Tommie's migration to Florida seems to
        have opened a road to pleasure for many of the Clan. Only the fact that
        we are at the farthermost corner has kept us from a visit, but we may
        yet charter an airship and go down for the week-end.
      </p>
<p>
        With greetings and best wishes to all the cousins,
      </p>
