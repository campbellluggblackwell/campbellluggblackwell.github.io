    <div class="Salutation">
      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> So very many things have transpired in the past twelve months that it
        is rather hard to know just where to begin and what to say that would be
        most interesting to you all. Perhaps the first thing that might be
        mentioned would be the genealogy chart - a copy of which was sent to
        each and every first and second cousin of the Campbell family early last
        summer. I sincerely trust that these charts were all received in good
        condition and have already been protected by suitable frames. hardly
        seems that another year has passed since we wrote our last letters. To
        some it has been a year which has brought sorrow and we wish to express
        our deep sympathy with those cousins who have lost loved ones. </p>
      <p> About the first of June each year we migrate to our cottage at Mt.
        Tabor, from which point we start on our vacation trips. Last summer, in
        company with a couple of friends from Maplewood, we drove out to Cape
        Cod and spent a very delightful ten days. We also had the pleasure of
        another ten day sojourn at Ocean Grove. These two vacation trips
        together with a few shorter ones and the time spend on the golf links on
        Saturdays during the golfing period, made the summer and fall slip away
        before we knew it. Then, about October first, we migrated back to our
        winter quarters at Maplewood, and the winter has likewise slipped by all
        too quickly.</p>
      <p>Another important event occurred on October fifteenth last when the
        Annual Cousins Dinner was held at <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie
          Congdon</a>'s place at Marshall's Falls, Pennsylvania. A total of
        twenty-two cousins sat down to dinner, and we all enjoyed a very
        pleasant time together. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1604">Edith</a>
        was suffering with an attack of bronchitis just at that time and could
        not attend the Dinner, but I had the pleasure of going up with <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">George</a>
        and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I927">Anna
          Buck</a> in their new <a href="http://www.conceptcarz.com/view/photo/767186,17246/1924-Packard-Single-Eight_photo.aspx#photo">Packard</a>,
        and as the day was perfectly gorgeous , we enjoyed the ride very much
        indeed. On the return trip that evening, my sister, <a href="SelphJennie1873.html">Jennie</a>,
        and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1608">her
          husband</a>, together with <a href="LoopStella1863.html">Stella
          Wilbur</a>, also came back with Cousin George and for the next few
        days we had a smaller reunion in Madison and Maplewood. Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I846">Edna
          Wright</a> joined us a little later, and we certainly did have one
        royal good time visiting, sight seeing, automobiling, etc. </p>
      <p> Three of the cousins whose names appear on our genealogy chart have
        been called Home during the past few months, and to each and every
        member of the families afflicted I am sure we all extend our heartfelt
        sympathy. The last one to be called to her reward was cousin <a href="CraneJennie1852.html">Jennie
          Bosard</a>, who died on February third. As you know, Cousin <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Ann
          Owlett</a> had been with </p>

      <p>Cousin Jennie from the middle of last November. Needless to say, Cousin
        Anna's help and cheer in the Washington home was very much appreciated
        and has gone a long way toward making the burden of <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1050">Cousin
          Mary</a> and <a href="BosardFlorence1887.html">Cousin Florence</a>
        very much lighter. I had been keeping in touch almost daily with Cousin
        Mary and was able to arrange my business affairs so that I could attend
        the funeral service.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> On March seventh it was our pleasure to have Cousins Ann Owlett and
        Mary Snavely come over from Washington and spend a week with us in New
        Jersey, and I feel sure it did Cousin Mary a world of good to have this
        diversion, and as Cousin Ann had never seen our city before, I feel that
        she will always carry with her many pleasant memories of things she did
        while she was here. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1604">Edith</a>
        and I have been very glad indeed to be favored with the visits of so
        many of the cousins since our last letters.</p>
      <p> Another item which I feel quite sure will be interesting but quite a
        surprise, is the fact that about ten days ago our daughter, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1605">Doris</a>,
        announced her engagement to <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1606">Philip
          W. Drake</a> of Morristown, N.J. Doris has now returned to college and
        will finish her second year in June. It is more than likely that before
        another exchange of letters she and Philip will be married and will make
        their home in Morristown. It might be said that we have known the family
        for years as they also spend their summers at Mt. Tabor. The young man
        is of high calibre, a worker in the church, a fine violinist and bass
        singer, and comes from a very substantial family of fine character. By
        profession he is the paying teller in one of the largest banks in his
        town. Edith and I, acting as a Board of Censor, gave our consent, and we
        all hope that the forth-coming union will prove to be a happy one. While
        we were just a bit disappointed that Doris should not complete her other
        two years of college, yet there are many compensating features to be
        considered and we feel that no mistake has been made. Morristown is only
        five miles from our Tabor cottage and fifteen miles from our Maplewood
        home, so that with good telephone and automotive service<sup>1</sup>, we
        shall see Doris and hear her voice as often as desired.</p>
      <p>Our plans for the coming summer are rather indefinite, and will depend
        a little upon Doris' plans, and providing, of course, that all of us,
        including Edith's <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I13671">mother</a>,
        are in good health, so that we can get away on a couple of trips in case
        they are planned. Personally, I want very much to again drive up to
        Tioga County and visit the cousins up there, and again travel over some
        of the old territory or my boyhood days, especially at Osceola and
        Nelson. The strenuosity of life in a big city like New York makes every
        business</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>1. It&nbsp; may seem stange to modern readers to see "telephone
        service" mentioned because we pretty much take it for granted. But in
        1925, many of the telephone companies were small, "mom &amp; pop"
        operations. Getting a phone installed after moving could take a long
        time. "Private lines" (one household per phone #), which we now take for
        granted, were very rare. Most phones were "party lines", i.e. 4, 6, or
        even a couple dozen houses might share the same phone #. So, you
        couldn't make a call --- or receive a call, if someone else was using
        their phone. But if you wanted to know when the line was available, you
        could just stay on the line and listen to their conversation! The
        operators used distinctive rings so that you could tell if an incoming
        call was for you or for someone else. In 1925 urban phone companies had
        a single button that could be pressed multiple times (e.g.to call '25'
        you would press the key twice, pause, then press it 5 times), or a dial,
        allowing local calls to be placed without operator assistance --- but
        all "long distance" calls required&nbsp; operator assistance. Therefore
        how many operators a phone company "manning" their switchboards had a
        big effect on the adequacy of their service.</p>

      <p>man wish at times that we could just fly away and be up on the old farm
        togged out with an old shirt and a pair of overalls, plugging around and
        getting his mind absolutely away from his business. Whether or not I can
        manage this during the coming summer remains to be seen, but I am going
        to try hard to do it. We also are going to try to reserve time so as to
        be present at the next Cousins Dinner to be held at <a href="TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie
          Clark</a>'s in Osceola, even if it is necessary to go and come by
        train. These family gatherings are certainly very fine and go a long way
        toward cementing the families together. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> I must not make this letter too long or <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">Cousin
          George</a> will scold, but I cannot resist the temptation to tell you
        how glad I am that he very kindly and unselfishly came to the rescue and
        will edit and compile our book of Cousins Letters this year inasmuch as
        the cousins in Washington could not assume this responsibility.<sup>2</sup>
        We are indeed to be congratulated on having the president of our
        organization - Cousin George - on the job. His business is that of
        publishing books and I know you are going to be delighted with the book
        this year. George and I have had many conferences regarding our book,
        the last one being late yesterday afternoon, when we spent another half
        hour together going over the matters. You will be glad to know that
        through George's efforts the cost of the binding, as well as the entire
        book, has been reduced considerably, which means a little saving for
        each of us. Cousin George will doubtless tell you more about the book
        itself in his own letter.</p>
      <p> Today is April eighth and about one-half of the letters are actually
        in. It is my earnest hope and desire that when the book is finally
        closed and ready for binding that at least seventy, or possibly
        seventy-five, letters will be contained therein. We do hope that from
        year to year more of the the cousins will interested themselves in our
        Correspondence Club and do all they can to make it a permanent success.</p>
      <p> I trust none of the cousins will be offended at being reminded three
        or four times to get their letters in, but the fact is, if we do not
        have the letters we cannot have the book. Let us all, therefore, keep
        sweet and cheerful, and do our little part, knowing that if each one
        does his or her part, the whole thing will come through in just the
        finest kind of shape.</p>
      <p> With love and best wishes to you all, believe me</p>
