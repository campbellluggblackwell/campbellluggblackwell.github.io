      <p> There is so much I should like to say that I scaree <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>
        know where to begin. Our two boys keep us quite busy mending both
        clothes and body during the very strenuous baseball season. Saturday the
        first "real" game was played; and of course "we" were victorious. The
        team is called "The Highlanders"--not out of respect to the Campbells,
        as I at first thought, but because we live adjacent to the highest spot
        in Madison. School work is an awful bore during "this season", and the
        homework is done in an indifferent sort of way. This morning I found <a

          href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I928">Donald</a>'s
        French book under his pillow. "His mind was on it", you see; but what he
        actually absorbed I do not know and dare not think. He is our fourteen
        year old and a regular fellow. </p>
      <p> Friday <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I929">Gordon</a>
        came home very jubilant because he had gotten one hundred percent on an
        arithmetic test--most unusual! So I began to inquire into his sudden
        precocity and found there was only one question asked, and it happened
        he had taken the extreme trouble to inform himself prior to the
        examination on one point, and happened to draw the lucky card. </p>

      <p> So, you see I am busy--not only at home, but also checking up ours as
        well as other people's children at school. How I do hope that some day
        before our grandchildren have children the human race of school teachers
        will have progressed enough to do away with examinations, and take the
        children for their real worth--educate instead of trying to make them
        imbibe a lot of information. </p>
      <p> Our Parent-Teacher Association is a really live youngster. It succeeds
        in doing something for the community once in a while and always gets a
        fine write-up in the daily and weekly papers. Publicity counts for more
        than we realize. We have been trying to bring the "midway" of our County
        Fair within the law, and it's been a huge job to get the Fair
        Association's sanction to abolish the games of chance and other things
        that have an immoral influence. This action brought about a lot of
        criticism against our local carnivals, so it again fell upon us as
        parents to ask our Borough Council to reconsider and weigh the matters
        carefully before granting permits. When a request was made by one of the
        local organizations for a permit last week the Council voted four to two
        against granting the permit in spite of the Mayor's plea for carnivals.
      </p>
      <p> Saturday, May second, we are to have a food sale and we hope to clear
        one hundred dollars. Thus Parent-Teacher Association(with a membership
        of two hundred) of which I am the President, with the Womans <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>
        Club (with a membership of three hundred thirty) of which I am Program
        Committee Chairman, besides several other things keep me too busy to be
        on time with my "Cousins Letter"; but not too busy to be happy to see
        any of you any time. </p>
      <p> We thoroughly enjoyed the short visits of several cousins during the
        year, and I hope that next year I may have the pleasure of meeting those
        whom I have nor met and meeting again those whom I have met before. </p>
