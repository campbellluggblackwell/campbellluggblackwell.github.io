    <div class="Salutation">
      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> So much has happened since I received your letters last fall that I
        hardly know what to write.<br>
      </p>
      <p> We are having severe March weather after so mild a winter.</p>
      <p> I am quite well again and am staying in my own home.</p>
      <p> We have a fine Presbyterian minister here now and I get out to church
        every Sunday.</p>
      <p> I wish all of my Cousins could come and see me.</p>
      <p> <em></em><em></em>I have twenty maple trees on my lot. My grandboy<sup>1</sup>
        and I are going to make sugar and if you were all here, I surely would
        treat you.</p>
      <p>I think we ought to congratulate <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will</a>,
        also ourselves, for our willing helpers who are going to continue our
        Correspondence Club. I enjoy the letters very much. Four of the first
        cousins live in Osceola. In Nelson, the old home town, very few of the
        cousins are left. </p>
      <p>Our next Campbell Re-union and Cousins Dinner are coming before our
        next Letters and I hope to be able to attend both gatherings this year
        and meet as many of you as can possibly attend.<br>
      </p>
