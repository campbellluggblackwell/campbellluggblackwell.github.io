    <div class="Salutation">
      <p>To the Campbell Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> I do not regard it as necessary that I introduce myself to your
        circle. It is more in the nature of an apology or regret that I am
        prompted to write for the immortal collection.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Many of you know that previous to last summer the house at Marshalls
        Falls<sup>1</sup> had been at the mercy of strangers for three years,
        and much that I would have done to right and restore therein was not
        possible between August and October twenty-second<sup>2</sup>.</p>
      <p> After the Cousins Dinner was over and all had departed for their
        homes, it was plainly revealed as my part to stay at Marshalls Falls and
        further the "bringing to order" of the chaotic state, and also prepare
        as much as possible for cold weather and the closing of the house until
        springtime.</p>
      <p> During those weeks there alone, I enjoyed what had not been my
        privilege in many years - the looking through and classifying of our
        books, some of which brought to mind memories sad, but sweet, of "those
        long loved and lost awhile". A number bore the name of grand- or great
        grand-parents.</p>
      <p>The book that especially called forth this "regret" was the New
        Testament of my husband's mother, in which were bits of her own writing
        and markings. Paramount and almost startling to me, were these lines:</p>
      <blockquote>Sarah Campbell's Book - 1851</blockquote>
      and
      <blockquote> "God give you Grace, herein to look,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That you may run the Blessed Race,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And never from The Truth depart,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, Heaven through Christ will be<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your rest."</blockquote>
      I opened and read where I saw a piece of cardboard with red wool
      ornamentation - it was the ninth chapter of Acts - wonderful revelation! </div>
    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>1. Anna's husband, <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie Congdon</a>,
        not only bought a summer home next to the falls, he also bought and
        operated, an adjoining resort hotel, Titania House all, of which is now
        being turned into a <a href="http://g41-prweb.newscyclecloud.com/article/20120712/NEWS/207120323">park</a>
        by the township.</p>
      <p>2. Oct. 22, 1924 was the date of the "Cousins Dinner", which that year
        was held at Charlie and Anna's summer home, in Marshalls Falls, PA, near
        Stroudsburg. It was the only time a Campbell Cousins Dinner was held
        that far away, prompting an alternate dinner hosted by Laura BOSARD
        Mowrey, for those who couldn't, or didn't wish to, travel that far.
        Their summer home had been rented out for 3 years because Anna &amp;
        Charlie's daughter, Louise, had been ill and Anna and her daughters,
        Louise and Bernice, stayed in CA and AZ for Louise to convalesce.</p>

          <p>Could I but have called you back for a glimpse into that Book, and
            each of us have received our vision of "that Blessed Race" and our
            "eternal resting place" where "they go no more out forever"! </p>
