    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>1. All the records I have seen state 1893 was the first. Such as <a href="ReunionMinutes1893.html">1893
          minutes</a>, <a href="ReunionMinutes1894.html">1894 minutes</a>, and
        <a href="ReunionProgram1894.html">1894 invitation</a>. I don't know why
        Laura BOSARD Mourey became convinced the first Campbell Reunion was in
        1892&nbsp; -wbt.</p>
      <p>2. Because they started in 1893, this was the 29th.</p>
      <p>3. Emma was confused. Mabel did have an Uncle Joseph D. Campbell. But
        Nina's father was Joseph G. Campbell, Mabel's 1st cousin twice removed</p>
