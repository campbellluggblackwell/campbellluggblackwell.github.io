      <p>
        Remembering my "Frosh" days in school here, it is with some trepidation
        that I venture to offer a few words to the Campbell Clan in which I am
        proud to have the privilege of enrollment. <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I815">
        Mother</a> has extolled the virtues of the clan--emphasizing not a
        little bit her own dear self--until I have formed an opinion that they
        must be supermen<sup>1</sup> and superwomen, and that these
        characteristics are inevitably handed down from generation to
        generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is my second year at the University. I am majoring in journalism,
        or rather, I am trying to get the fundamentals as a preparatory step
        for usefulness. I like it, but have reached the point where I am
        beginning to realize that it is some undertaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Registration in the University is two thousand seven hundred fifty with
        about the same number of boys and girls. While we are permitted to take
        part in some social functions, the faculty is apparently of the opinion
        that underclass students have well defined work laid out for them and
        that this is the main reason why they are here. And yet I am very much
        interested in my work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am living in Susan Campbell Hall, so you may see I am running true to
        color in this respect at least. In fact. the president of the
        University is a Campbell and, of course, he is Scotch like all of the
        rest of them, giving me a touch of the right atmosphere. We have very
        nice living quarters with accommodations for about one hundred girls,
        the quarters being divided into suites for four. All suites have
        sleeping porches, and these are used exclusively during all seasons,
        so, you see, we get plenty of fresh air.
      </p>
      <p>
        While my experience outside of Oregon has been very limited, I am a
        thorough webfooter<sup>2</sup>. I love the free and open spirit of
        Oregon folks, and the beautiful valley in which we live. Its green
        fields, myriads of fruit trees and blossoms at this season give me a
        thrill.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is my wish, and a very earnest one too, that the Campbell
        cousins--all of them, - be privileged to visit this bounteous land of
        sunshine and yes--rain, for it is the gentle mist during the dormant
        period which makes the country so prolific in its blessings.

        1. "Superman" didn't make his debut until 1933.

      <p>
        2. Oregon was once known as "the webfoot state", so the students at the
        U. of Oregon are "webfooters."
