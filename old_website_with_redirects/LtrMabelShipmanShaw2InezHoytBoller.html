      <p>Dear Inez,</p>

      <p class="Message">In February, I remember that <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">mamma</a>
        always wrote to your <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">mother</a>, then
        after she was gone to you. I know it is past Aunt Phebe's birthday but
        have thought of you and wondered what you are doing these cold days.
        Isn't this beautiful weather? Very cold today, but clear &amp; nice. </p>
      <p class="Message"><a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Shaw-15819">Llewellyn</a>
        is at the store as this is Saturday evening and I have been listening to
        the radio. It's always a great wonder to me and I think I shall never
        get over the mystery of it.<sup>1</sup></p>
      <p class="Message">Llewellyn &amp; I are all alone, for the first time
        nearly, since we have been married. It seems queer to have just the two
        of us. <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cox-26920">Genevieve</a><sup>2</sup>
        says she thinks we should have a chaperone.</p>
      <p class="Message">I came across some papers with mention of mamma's death
        in and am enclosing clippings which I thought you might like to have. I
        intended to send them to some of the cousins<sup>3</sup> but only got
        part way around. We miss her more and more &amp; how I long to talk over
        things with her. She was always so cheerful and had such a wonderful
        mind &amp; heart.</p>
      <p class="Message"><a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Shipman-1425">Helen</a>
        and the boys<sup>4</sup> are fine. <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Shipman-1553">Uncle
          John</a> died one year ago yesterday. <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Merritt-3025">Aunt
          Dell</a> keeps quite well. <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Aunt Kate</a>
        and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Horton-6706">Uncle Lish</a>
        are having a wonderful time in the sunny south.<sup>5</sup> About a
        dozen from here have gone this winter.</p>
      <p class="Message">We<sup>6</sup> are going to take our trip this summer.
        We sail June 22 from New York &amp; expect to spend two months away from
        home visiting France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Holland
        &amp; England. We may go to Scotland but are not sure whether we will
        want to stay another eight days. It will be interesting to visit Rome,
        Pompeii, the Catacombs, Venice, etc. We will be eight days in and around
        Paris - five in London. Wish you and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Boller-100">Will</a>
        could go along.</p>
