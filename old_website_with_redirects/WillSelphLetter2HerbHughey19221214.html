        Dear Cousin <a href="HugheyHerbert1857.html">Herb</a>;-
      </p>

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        For the first time in a number of years, I had the pleasure of
        attending the Cousin's Dinner at Nelson [PA]. It was held at the home
        of <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Ann Owlett</a> on October 5th, 1922.
        Fortunately, I put my camera in my travelling [sic] bag before leaving
        home, and I snapped half a dozen pictures of the folks and have had
        enough copies printed so that every family could have a set of these
        photographs. Although you were unable to be at the Dinner, yet I wanted
        you to have on of the sets and I am sending it to you under separate
        cover in today's mail. You will have no trouble in recognizing most of
        the people, especially the third picture in the group which takes in
        the thirteen Own Cousins who attended the Dinner. <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1171">
        Mark Owlett</a> took the picture and I think the camera jarred just a
        trifle as the faces seem a bit blurred. You will at once recognize
        <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie Campbell</a> on the one end
        and <a href="SeelyJud1851.html">Jud Seely</a> on the other. My own
        picture is in the center of the back row between my sister <a href=
        "SelphJennie1873.html">Jennie</a> and Cousin <a href=
        "HoytInez1871.html">Inez Hoyt</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Herb, I cannot remember you as you went West when I was a small boy and
        I have not the slightest recollection of you, in fact, your father and
        <a href="CampbellElizabeth1830.html">mother</a> died when I was so
        small that I can hardly remember them. If you have a photograph of
        yourself and <a href="BixbyHannah1863.html">wife</a> which you could
        spare, I wish you would send it to me as I would prize it most highly.
        I am today writing <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed Congdon</a> out
        in Tacoma to do the same thing, as he is another one who has been away
        from the family for so many years that only the oldest of the Cousins
        would remember him. You know my sister, Jennie, and I are the youngest
        of all the Cousins as <a href="CampbellJulia1845.html">our mother</a>
        was the youngest of all the older generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought you would be highly pleased with the pictures I am sending
        you and know you will be glad to have them.
      </p>
      <p>
        With very best wishes and complements of the season, believe me.
      </p>
