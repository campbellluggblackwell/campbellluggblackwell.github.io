        <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann Clinch</a> was born in 1804 in
        England, and came to this province, when one year old, with her
        parents. Her <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I20">
        father</a> soon died of yellow fever in New York City. Her <a href=
        "LuggSarah1778.html">mother</a> went to Jersey Shore,<sup>1</sup>
        married one <a href="BlackwellEnoch1764ca.html">Mr. Blackwell</a>. She
        was brought up on the Delaware River, Town of New Hope, by one <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2682">
        Peter Blackwell.</a><sup>2</sup> She stayed there until she was
        eighteen years of age. By the suggestion of her mother <a href=
        "CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph Campbell</a> went to her place and she
        came with him to <a href="BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's Island</a>,
        the home of her mother; stayed there until the spring of 1822. They
        married, went to housekeeping on the farm that <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I90">
        Joseph, Jr.</a> now owns and lived there until she died in 1872, aged
        sixty-eight years.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was very efficient in helping clear and pay for the farm; reared a
        family of eleven children. Our garments were all made by her
        industrious hands for both summer and winter wear. She spun flax and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tow">tow</a> and had the yarn
        wove into cloth for their first bedtick. Her mother gave her a pair of
        pillows. She raised geese and made a feather bed so they had one good
        bed at this time. She also made quilts and comfortables.<sup>3</sup>
        She would get her children in bed and go out with her husband and chunk
        up and burn the heaps<sup>4</sup> until midnight. The flats were
        covered with pine trees. They girdled them that they might die, then
        burned them down to get rid of them. The clearing was very heavy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ruin of the old house still remains to remind us of the many happy
        days spent there and the long winter evenings when we studied our
        lessons or played games; father reading the newspaper or Bible, while
        mother was always busy with the needle. The girls did the knitting. Six
        of us would be knitting at once. We would try stents<sup>5</sup> to see
        which was the fastest knitter. <a href=
        "CampbellEleanor1828.html">Eleanor</a> wore the belt. Our light was a
        pitch pine torch in the fire place. We had our time for play. I
        remember the grape vine swings that Uncle <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I49">
        Richard Ellison</a>'s children and ourselves would fix up on the
        butternut trees. If we didn't provide ourselves with strings we would
        tear our aprons into strings to tie the vines together. The grape vines
        grew along the river on the North side of the farm.

        1. Lycoming Co., PA. She had known widower Enoch Blackwell in Avening,
        in England, and they crossed on the same ship.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Jane remembered Ann's foster father as Enoch's brother, Peter. But
        as explained in Ann's mini-bio, the late <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2956">
        Stella MAUGERI</a> Blackwell and I believe Ann was more likely to have
        been raised by a different brother, Joshua. Sarah would have known both
        Joshua and Peter, probably in England, and certainly from the ship.
        Joshua lived for a while in Bucks Co., PA. But most of Ann's growing up
        seems likely to have been across the river, in or near Lambertville,
        NJ. Joshua was a farmer, so it may have been in what is now Hunterdon
        Co.'s Delaware Twp. or West Amwell Twp.

        5. Contests. From 'stint', as in a period of time.

        I remember brother <a href="CampbellJohn1836.html">John</a> and myself
        crossed the river, went down along Losy's pond to gather beech nuts. We
        got a nice lot of them but, on coming back found that the river had
        swollen. We were not cowardly for I got a pole and told John to go
        above me. The nuts were in a sack, and I put them over my shoulder and
        we went through alright. If mother had seen us she would have been down
        there too quick.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first school teacher I can remember was Ruie Bacon. Eight of us
        children went at once. One stayed to carry the dinner in a large pail.
        One dinner was composed of hocks and johnnycake. Willard Gibson taught
        that term and he ate with us; said he never ate so good a
        dinner.<sup>6</sup>

        Mother's children can rise up and call her blessed, her husband also,
        and he praiseth her.<sup>7</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        I can remember well going to prayer meeting with mother to old <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I211">
        Grandmother Bottom</a>'s and in the log school house over the creek. It
        can be said of her, she riseth also while it is yet night and giveth
        meat to her household and a portion to her maidens. Her husband is
        known in the gates when he sitteth with the elders of the land. She
        seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hand.<sup>8</sup>
      </p>

        It seems but a step to look back in memory when this country was a vast
        body of timber. I can remember when the road leading to Nelson was so
        thickly timbered what it was dark in the day time.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we go back to the home of our childhood how all the scenes and
        memories of those days crowd into our minds and hearts. <a href=
        "CampbellElizabeth1830.html">Sister Hughey</a> and myself enjoyed that
        privilege last summer. We visited our old playgrounds, went in the
        orchard, could point out our favorite trees where we got the best
        apples. I do not think the scenes of childhood can ever be obliterated
        from memory, from my earliest recollection to the present time. I have
        found joys and sorrows, losses and errors, but have learned to look on
        the bright side of life. Our chief end is to glorify God and enjoy Him
        forever, keeping eternity in view and all will be well.

        Since our last meeting a beloved sister has gone home.<sup>9</sup> One
        by one we go across the river, and He treads the winepress
        alone.<sup>10</sup> Why shrink to follow His example?
