        My dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Knowing by past experience that if my letter is not on time my <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a> will call me down, and since
        it's snowy and cold today - a real March day - and there is no going to
        church for country people<sup>1</sup>, I am taking this "Sabbath Day",
        as my mother would say, to write you. I feel that I am not capable of
        doing justice to either you or myself, just at present. I am not very
        strong and am very nervous.
      </p>
      <p>
        A letter from <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1505">
        Roswell Young</a> says, "Write the little things of family life". One
        of the big things of my life was when I could go to Elmira and visit my
        much loved <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1493">
        Cousin Lou</a>. On one of these visits Roswell went to a picnic, his
        mother packing his lunch basket and sending one of her best solid
        silver spoons. When he returned, the spoon was missing. She talked to
        him very seriously, and tried to impress the fact that it was one of
        her best. That night he found it in his trouser pocket, and bringing it
        to her he said, "There's your old best spoon!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Next day at lunch <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1501">
        Ethel</a> announced that she was going to <a href=
        "http://www.joycetice.com/postcard/roricks1.htm">Roricks</a> that
        afternoon, and not to school. Her mother said,"No, Ethel, not today".
        Whereupon she set up a big cry. Her <a href=
        "YoungPhilip1866.html">father</a> got up from the table and
        administered a spank that took all thought of Roricks out of Ethel's
        mind, I am sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my family a good many things have happened in the past year. In May
        it was necessary for me to go to the Arnot-Ogden Hospital at Elmira.

        daughter</a> brought me a box of candy at two different times. Cards
        and letters came from everyone of my cousins except one, I think, and
        from lots of the second cousins and friends. Cousin <a href=
        "CraneJennie1852.html">Jennie Bosard</a> wrote me several times.
        Flowers, four dozen beautiful roses, came from "the three
        Selphs<sup>3</sup>". When my nurse brought them to my room she said,
        "That fellow must be a millionaire."

        Dr. Loop</a><sup>4</sup> said to me one day, "<a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> must think a lot of you. He
        writes me every day asking me to tell him just how you are, and he says
        that you are one of his favorite cousins." I think the Campbell cousins
        ought to be thankful to have so wonderful a surgeon in the family as
        Dr. Ross G. Loop. A good many know him by experience. <a href=
        "CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie Congdon</a> spent an hour with me
        there.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I left the hospital I went down to <a href=

        David</a> is a lively boy of one year.
      </p>
      <p>
        In October I went to Binghamton where Jessie lives. While there we
        drove down the Lackawanna Trail to Great Bend. We were going to New
        Milford, but the day was cold, and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1251">
        Walter</a> had tire trouble, so we went back. From there we went on to
        Elizabeth, one hundred miles farther. Was there one week, then they
        took me for several nice rides. We went to Herkimer, eighty miles
        farther north, where William has a niece, and we spent a very pleasant
        day there. The roads are real roads in that country. I had the pleasure
        of riding on the "Million Dollar Highway"<sup>6</sup> while there, a
        few miles anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have seen "<a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_%281924_film%29">America</a>" and
        "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Covered_Wagon">The Covered
        Wagon</a>" this winter.
      </p>
      <p>
        In January William went to the Arnot-Ogden Hospital for an operation
        which was successful. He is feeling well now, only not strong enough to
        do much work. I went with him and spent the nights with <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1285">
        Isabelle</a>. She can cook like any of the Campbells, and is a good
        housekeeper although she is a teacher by profession. Her <a href=
        "GoodrichFrances1871.html">mother</a> was in Osceola at that
        time<sup>7</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have just bought a six cylinder up-to-date Reo truck<sup>8</sup>. It
        is very comfortable to ride in. I go quite a bit when our mud roads
        permit. William has a rather extensive milk route.

        4. Dr. Ross Loop was not a "blood relative" but he was considered part
        of the family because he was a half-brother of Cousin Stella LOOP
        Hooker Wilbur.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. After my mother's father died, she was raised by her aunt, Inez, and
        husband William Boller (my namesake). Because both my grandfathers had
        died before my parents married, Billy Boller served as a surrogate
        grandfather to my siblings and me, hence to us he was always "Grampa
        Bill".
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Countless stretches of highway all over the country, being paved for
        the first time, were locally called by that name. In this case, I
        suspect she was referring to NY5 thru the Mohawk Valley, which followed
        the route of the Erie Canal and in turn was followed by the NY Thruway.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Isabelle's monther, Frances (Goodrich) Hoyt, spent time in Osceola
        because <u>her</u> mother, Elizabeth (Batterham) Goodrich, was
        suffering from dementia. The Goodriches lived in a home built for them
        by their son-in-law, Lee Smith Tubbs. Lee built it for them just across
        the street from where he and Mary (Goodrich) Tubbs lived.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. I remember that truck, It was still running 20 years later. I have
        photos of it -- and of the pony with my eldest brother riding her.

        Cousin <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">Mary Shipman</a> wrote me
        February twelfth, as she always does on my mother's birthday. It's a
        thought I appreciate most sincerely. Cousin <a href=
        "CampbellKate1853.html">Kate</a> has sent cards this winter from the
        South, as have Cousin <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a> and

      <p>
        I called at <a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">Mark Seely</a>'s Thursday
        evening while William was at the barber shop. We all went to a warm
        sugar social<sup>10</sup> given in the hall by the "Presbyterian Ladies
        Aid". <a href="SeelyLena1873.html">Lena</a><sup>11</sup> and I are both
        very hard of hearing. We have good visits with pencil and
        tablet<sup>12</sup>. Most of the Campbells who are left in Nelson are
        working to keep the church our Grandfather helped to build alive. The
        congregation is small. We have a very fine minister. It seems to me it
        is a duty for each one of us to do our best to help. I believe we shall
        have it to answer for if we through carelessness, selfishness and
        don't-care-ness let the church go down. I am sure our grandparents and
        parents would think the same way.<sup>13</sup>

        <a href="LoopStella1863.html">Stella</a> is very thoughtful of other
        shut-ins. A letter, card, or magazine or book finds its way to our mail
        box very often. I try to do the same by her. <a href=

        Tom</a> came from Binghamton for the day. While their stay was very
        short, we enjoyed every minute of it. Tom went to the attic for
        butternuts, and to the cellar for apples; also a little bit of eats
        went in the bag. Taste better when they come from
        Granny's<sup>17</sup>.

        I think that I have done more than my duty this time. The day of the

        9. In the 1920s, as before, most farm wives baked their own bread. So,
        in buying bread with hard earned money, he was lightening the burden on
        her.
      </p>
      <p>
        10. At this time of year, Nelson-ites, and most country folks along the
        state line on both sides of the border, were boiling down sap to make
        maple syrup and maple sugar. What was this "warm sugar social" that
        apparently was held at the Odd Fellows Hall (as were Campbell reunions
        on rainy days)? Presumably it was similar to an ice cream social,
        strawberry shortcake event. Old newspapers explain: <span style=
        "font-style: italic;">They make "warm sugar" by boiling down sap to a
        syrup and beating it into a creamy sugar. It is eaten by the
        party-goers on buttered buns. Pickles and coffee whet the taste</span>.
        My mother, who was from Nelson, didn't do that with the new syrup.
        Instead of beating it, she served warm syrup in individual, small bowls
        -- along with fresh from the oven, baking powder biscuits.
      </p>
      <p>
        11. On their mother's sides, Lena and Inez were 1st cousins once
        removed. But in addition, Lena was the widow of David Goodrich, brother
        of Inez' sister-in-law, Frances GOODRICH Hoyt.
      </p>
      <p>
        12. Lena was profoundly deaf after having scarlet fever as a child. My
        sister told me about having many of these writing pad conversations
        with Lena. As a teenager, she resented being delegated as the one to
        "go visit Aunt Lena" when my parents and siblings would visit Nelson.
      </p>
      <p>
        13. It saddens me that the Beecher's Island Presbyterian church
        building was allowed to decay to the point it had to be torn down. Our
        early Campbells and sons-in-law Sam and John Hazlett put so much blood,
        sweat and tears into building it, and it meant so much to them. I'm
        sure Inez was right that her aunts and uncles, and grandparents, would
        have been disappointed if a crystal ball had shown them it's fate. But
        most of the decline of Nelson, and similar small communities, was an
        almost inevitable result of Henry Ford and the Model-T. And when most
        of Nelson's homes were demolished to make way for the lake and the
        residents scattered, maintaining two separate congregation ---
        Methodist and Presbyterian, became impractical. The Beecher's Island
        Presbyterian Church was the one my mother attended until she married
        and moved away. It meant a lot to her, which is why she made a painting
        of it.. But she was also linked to the Methodist church building, which
        was moved from the South Side to the "New Nelson" and is used by the
        merged, non-denominational congregation. Her maternal grandfather, Rev.
        Henry Goodrich was it's minister, and the building has a stained glass
        window in his memory. For more detail, see <a href=
        "http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Ecapane/BeechersIsland.html">
        Beecher's Island</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        14. Ann lost her husband and youngest son. Ada's house burned down (See
        her letter on page 2.)
      </p>
      <p>
        15. The 1924 "Cousins Dinner" was held at Charlie Congdon's summer
        home, near Stroudsburg, PA. That was the farthest from Nelson one was
        ever held, and further than some of the "First Cousins" (i.e.grand
        children of Joseph and Ann Clinch Campbell) were willing or able to
        travel, so Laura held an alternate one, at her farm in Farmington Twp..
      </p>
      <p>
        16. The Cousins Dinner was created by and for the 30 grandchildren of
        Joseph and Ann Clinch Campbell. Some were uncomfortable with the
        "anyone can come" Campbell Reunions, which sometimes had several
        hundred attendees. These 30 "First Cousins" all grew up in Nelson,
        knowing and playing with each other. The dinner's were intentionally
        exclusive. Only the First Cousins were welcome, but it was up to the
        hostess of a dinner as to who else would be invited. They waited until
