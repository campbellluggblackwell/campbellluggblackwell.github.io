      <p>Dear Cousins:-</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>I am rather late with my letter but have been ill and unable to write as I hoped. I have had La Grippe<sup>1</sup> 
      and also ear trouble but am very much better now and with my three boys and 
      <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I873">Betty</a> am kept busy every 
      minute, so letter writing is generally put aside.</p>
      <p>Most of you have no doubt heard of 
      <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I836">Papa</a>'s death which 
      occured last October while he was visiting at his boyhood home in Tioga, Pa. It came as a shock to us all as he had 
      seemed to be in good health for some time. It was very hard indeed to take up life again without him.<p>
<p><a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I848">Lynn</a> and 
<a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I855">Donald</a> are both working and 
doing splendidly and each has a car which we enjoy very much.<p>
<p><a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I864">Billy</a> is doing very nicely 
in school; he had quite a severe accident to his right hand last year just before school closed, while in his woodworking 
class. He nearly severed the index finger and when it healed there was a swelling on the knuckle which caused stiffness in 
the joint. During his Easter vacation we had an Xray taken which revealed a splinter of bone in the joint so he went back in 
the hospital and was operated on by a specialist and is just now recovering but we feel it is not much better. We are very 
anxious because it will be such a handicap to his athletics when he enters college.</p>
<p>Betty, my youngest, is getting along famously and just at present her time is very much occupied in school by an Operetta 
which is to take place the first of June. She has been taking Character and Interprative Dancing at Eastman School of Dramatic 
Art<sup>2</sup> this winter so she has been quite a busy girlie, and is very well.</p>
<p>We are very pleasantly situated here in Rochester and are very glad we located here as there are so many privileges for the children in school and wonderful opportunities for us all.</p>
<p>We have a radio from which we derive a lot of pleasure and are always hoping we may hear some of the Cousins broadcasting.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>The boys join us in sending love to you all,</p>
    </div>

<p>2. I'm not sure if that was affiliated with the Eastman School of Music.</p>
<p>3. Radio was a big thing, mentioned in many of the CCC letters. It's widespread use was fairly new. Just the previous year, 
Calvin Coolidge became the first president to broadcast his inagural address. And, listening for Cousins wasn't just a fantasy. 
Radio stations in several major cities carried performances by some, such as 
<a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1537">Edward Young</a> and 
<a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1478">Harry Campbell</a>.</p>
