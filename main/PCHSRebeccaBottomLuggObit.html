              Rebecca Lugg</a>, died at her home in Nelson on Saturday,
            the 16th instant, aged 54 years. Mrs. Lugg had been an
            invalid for some time, but her death was a shock to her
            relatives and friends, who had supposed that she was
            improving. Acute Bright's disease was the immediate cause of
            her death. She leaves four children to mourn her loss---<a

            on Monday in the Presbyterian church, she having long been a
            member of that society. Rev. Mr. Armstrong preached an
            excellent sermon. Beautiful flowers---roses, carnations and
            similax covered the casket as they laid her remains beside
            those of her husband, who died five years ago. Friends were
            present from Bradford, Wellsboro, Elkland, Corning and
            Elmira.<br>
