            <h4>1st Grade: "All I want is a bookcase.” </h4>
            <p>I think my first year of school is different enough from most of
              my readers' experience, to merit discussing in some detail.</p>
            <p>But first, I'd like to draw a distinction between the words <i><b>education</b></i>
              and <i><b>training</b></i>. There is some overlap between the
              two. Education always involves some degree of training and
              training always involves some degree of education, but the goals
              are different.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#EdTrain"></a>
            </p>
            <p>OK. Back to first grade. As you know, my mother was the teacher.
              Sometimes that was a problem because she had to bend over backward
              not to show any favoritism. But the big differences were in its
              country setting -- and in having multiple grades sharing the same
              room, same teacher, and the different grades activities occurring
              simultaneously. Which worked out much better than you might think.<a
                aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#Planning"></a></p>
            <p> The site faced the busy road [NY 7], but was set well back and
              had no fencing that I recall. It probably had been abandoned
              farmland. In front was a large, lawn, but to the sides and behind,
              farm fields had turned to meadows which were now acquiring patches
              of shrubs, such as staghorn sumac.<img src="StaghornSumac.png" alt="Photo of staghorn sumac shrub"
                style="width:20%;"> Sometimes pairs or small groups of
              kindergartners utilized those thickets to conduct their own
              independent studies of comparative anatomy. Behind the school, the
              land gently sloped down to a creek, which was on the other side of
              a high embankment, topped by raised railroad tracks -- the maim
              line of the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western RR. And an
              underpass that once let farm equipment or livestock get to the
              creek and beyond. In good weather on warm days, we had time on our
              lunch recess to go to the creek. The creek had minnows and
              crayfish &amp; salamanders -- a kid's treasure trove of wildlife.
              (And the fields and a hedgerow had red-winged blackbirds.) Who
              today can imagine letting little kids wander around like that
              unsupervised? My mother had a large handbell that she would ring
              loudly to let us know recess was ending.<img src="HandBell.png" alt="Drawing of a hand bell"
                style="width:20%; float:right;"> If you were still down by the
              creek when it rang, you had to run fast to get back in time. Or
              else. Or-elses were serious. The principal had a paddle -- and
              used it on occasion.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#CorpPun"></a>
              My mother had a stool in a rear corner of the room. If a student
              was disruptive, she would grab them by an ear, twist it, and march
              them to the stool where they would sit facing the corner for a
              duration she felt appropriate.</p>
            <p>As I mentioned in the "Before School" chapter, my mother taught K
              through 3rd grade in one room and it worked well. Usually, she
              would start the day -- after we pledged allegiance -- by quickly
              giving each grade an assignment they could do on their own, such
              as "Read pages x through z" of a school book, or copying sentences
              from the blackboard or whatever, and then work with one grade on
              their lesson. A common variation of that was to have an older
              grade help the next younger class with material that they had
              studied the previous year. That served two purposes. One, each of
              the younger kids had an individual tutor for that morning's (or
              afternoon's) lesson. And also, because teaching is one of the best
              ways of reinforcing what you have learned and forcing you to think
              about and hopefully better understand what you had learned the
              year before. It could get a little noisy -- especially when the
              kindergartners were playing their rhythm instruments. </p>
            <p> <u>December 1941</u>. On the first Sunday of that month, I was
              playing in our sideyard. Across the side street, some older boys
              were playing, a couple of houses away. Suddenly they began
              shouting excitedly "We're at war. We're at war." I went into our
              house and asked my mother, "What's a war?"</p>
            <p>As I told you in a previous chapter, I loved being read to and
              couldn’t wait until first grade to be able to read, so I persuaded
              my siblings into pointing to each word as they read it aloud as a
              way of circumventing my mother's forbidding them from teaching me
              to read. It didn't "spoil" first grade for me, I still had a lot
              to learn, such as how to “sound out" words,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
                href="#SoundingOut"></a> but I was reading pretty well. </p>
            <p>This brings us to the title of this segment. By now you know that
              I loved books -- and still do.</p>
            <p> For what turned out to be my last Christmas in Conklin, my
              parents asked what I wanted for Christmas. They now had money to
              spend, as for the previous year’s pedal-able airplane. But they
              were surprised when I answered “A bookcase.” They took that in
              stride pretty well, but were flummoxed [and I think disappointed]
              when they asked “What else” and I answered “Nothing else, just a
              bookcase."</p>
            <p>On Christmas morning, I unwrapped a large, “From Santa” package
              that was under the tree. And stood there in obvious
              disappointment. When they asked “What’s wrong?” I said, “But I
              wanted a bookcase!” Their assurances that it WAS a bookcase were
              to no avail. Eventually, they thought to ask “What was it you
              wanted to do with a bookcase?” And I explained, “I wanted to carry
              books around.” They were able to decipher my desire and find a
              sturdy, kid-sized, cardboard briefcase. It was perfect! I could
              put half a dozen books in it, carry them out under a shade tree,
              and read to my heart’s content!<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
                href="#Bookcase"></a></p>
            <h4>2nd Grade: "Orphans' Patches.”</h4>
            <p>Before starting second grade we moved back to Binghamton's south
              side. This time to a nice bungalow at 62 Tompkins St., between the
              river and Conklin St.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#TompkinsMove"></a>
              I attended a large elementary school, several blocks away, this
              time with two separate room for each grade (one for those starting
              a grade in Sept. and one for those starting it in Jan.) I believe
              it was Benjamin Franklin,<img src="BenFranklin.png" alt="Photo of Benjamin Franklin school, Binghamton, NY"
                style="width:35%; float:right;"> remember that it was near an
              orphanage, and that the orphans attended our school. They usually
              came to school in clothes that were clean, but had been mended or
              carefully patched. I was a very idealistic kid, convinced that the
              world should be fair. That was one of my big complaints about
              things -- "But it's not fair." Which is why I was horrified when
              our teacher would ridicule them in front of the whole class for
              their neatly mended and patched clothing. What kind of a person is
              so cruel as to do that to innocent children, for something they
              have no control of? Obviously someone with little or no
              empathy.&nbsp; And probably low self-esteem or they wouldn't need
              to put down others like that. Whatever the reason, such behavior
              is inexcusable for a teacher.</p>
            <h4>3rd Grade: "Aches &amp; Pains.”</h4>
            <p>Third grade<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#Ink"></a>
              started the next fall, fortunately with a different teacher (most
              of my teachers were excellent or at least adequate). But I only
              attended for 3 weeks. Then I started having fever, fatigue, and
              intense pain in my ankles and knees. Dr. Weiss made a house call<img
                src="DoctorsBlackBag.png" alt="Photo of a doctor's 'little black bag' for making house calls"
                style="width:20%;"> and diagnosed me as having rheumatic fever.<a
                aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#Rheumatic"></a> The main
              treatment in those days was to rub methyl salicylate (synthetic
              oil of wintergreen) on the inflamed joints for temporary relief.
              (I still find the smell of wintergreen comforting.) Because
              rheumatic fever can injure the heart valves, he said I wasn't to
              get out of bed for four months and wasn't to sit up unaided.
              Someone was to lift me to a sitting position and prop me up with
              pillows. By the time that was over, my muscles had atrophied and
              forgotten how to walk. I had to build them back up and relearn
              walking.</p>
            <p>I got to read a lot. And to have books read to me. In addition to
              those I've already mentioned, were <i>Peter Church Mouse</i>, <i>Gabriel
                Church Kitten</i> and Howard Pyle's <i>The Story of King Arthur
                and His Knights</i> and his <i> The Merry Adventure of Robin
                Hood</i>. If anyone sees me as a hopeless romantic, blame the
              latter two books. [It took me a long time to realize that jumping
              on a white charger to rescue a damsel in distress wasn't always
              wise or appropriate.] But even with all the reading, I often was
              bored and time hung heavy. So, my grandmother taught me to crochet
              and to do cross-stitch embroidery -- they helped dispel the
              tedium.</p>
            <p>Scholastically, I lucked out on two counts. One, Binghamton used
              a semester system, so public school grades started in both
              September and January and you could graduate in either June of
              January. Therefore I was only held back half a year instead of a
              whole year. And two, that my mother was certified to teach grades
              K through 12. I wasn't cleared by the doctor to resume school in
              January, but my mother taught me at home. And by April or so, I
              was able to join my new class -- This time at Henry W. Longfellow
              Elementary School. But with restrictions. The doctor didn't allow
              me to run or participate in any strenuous activities. The third
              and fourth grades (each starting in January) went smoothly. I was
              a good student, who usually knew the answers, but didn't put my
              hand up often -- I didn't want to be seen as a "show off." Some of
              my doctor's restrictions were eased. But in fifth grade, I
              encountered a strict teacher. Normally that was no problem, I was
              a quiet, well-behaved kid. However, my extra reading got me in
              trouble. One day the teacher was giving us a lesson from the
              textbook when I put up my hand. "Yes, Billy." To which I replied,
              "Excuse me Mrs. White, but the textbook is wrong. It says ..., but
              really ...." Wrong thing to say to her in front of the class. I
              was on thin ice the rest of that year.</p>
            <h4>6th Grade: "More Aches &amp; Pains.”</h4>
            <p>Sixth grade started out fine in January, under a well-liked
              teacher, Mrs. McCormick. But then a recurrence of the rheumatic
              fever, not as bad, but I was out for months. Not confined to bed
              very long. Now I was under the care of a cardiology practice. But
              a fairly long convalescence. This time instead of filling my time
              with crocheting and cross-stitching, I went for walks with the
              family dog, a pointer. A boy couldn't ask for a better companion.
              We did a lot of exploring. And a lot of communing with favorite
              trees. There was a grand white oak and soft, moss carpet below; a
              large, magnificent ash, plus my favorite, a tall, gnarled old
              hemlock that had a great spot to sit at its base, among the roots,
              leaning back looking up at its curved trunk and at a neighboring
              bee tree, with industrious workers constantly coming and going all
              day. I had been with my classmates for three-plus years now, so,
              even though my close friends were mostly neighbors, not
              classmates, I was sorry to be left behind.</p>
            <p>But my new sixth-grade class -- now starting in September, made
              up for that. We had a great teacher, Mr. Ulysses S. Avery. And a
              good set of classmates, some of whom were with me for the next
              eleven years -- all through college. I was a smart kid and a good
              student in most subjects (let's not talk about spelling and
              penmanship), but not chosen for the school's gifted program.
              Speaking of not being chosen, because of my years of restricted
              activities I wasn't very good at sports, and even though the
              tallest, I was invariably one of the last chosen when teams formed
              on the playground. I also was a skinny kid, which I guess made me
              look less formidable than I thought. One day I saw a short,
              stocky, tough guy classmate picking on a much younger kid. I
              bravely said "Stop that. Leave him alone." "Oh yeah, who's going
              to make me?" "I am." At which point he sucker punched me in the
              stomach, knocked my wind out, and walked off, leaving me on the
              ground, gasping for air. Being a knight in shining armor takes
              more than just good intentions. That summer, I bid a fond farewell
              to PS 13 and found myself in three years of hell in West Jr. H. S.
              Fortunately my three years of high school made up for that.</p>
            <h4>Junior High: "Nightmare.”</h4>
            <p>I literally had nightmares about it for years. For one thing, the
              junior high school seemed humongous.<img src="WestJr.png" alt="Photo of West Junior High, Binghamton, NY"
                style="width:20%;"> And very institutionalized. The decor was
              drab and felt more like what I imagined a prison was like than a
              school. The long, drab hallways were crowded when we changed
              classes -- noisy and sometimes rowdy. The boys' gym teachers were
              macho jocks - wanna-be drill sergeants. They had no use for sissy
              wimps who presented doctors' notes saying, "Please excuse William
              from ___ activity." Our class schedules seemed complex, differing
              from day to day as to where you were supposed to be when. Just
              figuring out WHERE everything was presented a big problem at
              first. Backpacks or book bags weren't common then and just
              juggling our big pile of books was a challenge. As sometimes
              getting from one corner on the top floor to an opposite corner on
              the bottom floor in the allotted time was difficult. For the most
              part, the teachers were OK, but the 7th and 8th-grade guidance
              counselor was great. For me, he was the school's saving grace. I
              made one lifelong friend there, Nelson Theodore "Ted" Sommers, now
              deceased.</p>
            <p>I dreaded the start of each semester. My three older siblings had
              all gone there and were well-regarded by the teachers, many of
              whom still remembered them, despite our age differences. On the
              first day of class, we would introduce ourselves, seat by seat. Or
              sometimes the teacher would call the roll. Of course, they had a
              list of the students' names.</p>
            <p>I'm not sure why it bothered me, but often, before I had a chance
              to say a word, the teacher would take one look at me and say "You
              must be a Thompson." Perhaps I wanted to stand on my own merits,
              rather than being "one of them" -- even if it was a favorable
              "them."</p>
            <p>The worst part of the day was riding to and from the junior high
              on the bus. We walked to the elementary school and took the bus
              from there. The school district didn't have its own fleet of
              school buses - they chartered buses from the local public transit
              company, with their regular drivers, but making one special run
              each morning and afternoon. The drivers didn't like having a
              busload of noisy kids, so they ignored us as much as possible. And
              thus the bullies had a field day. If a fight broke out the driver
              would stop and throw the offenders off the bus, but that was the
              extent of their involvement. </p>
            <p>One year, I think I was in 9th grade. I was in a sledding
              accident. I completely severed all the tendons in my left wrist
              and would have lost the use of them had I not gotten to surgery
              before the tendons retracted.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#Sledding"></a>
              They were stitched back together and in time were fine. But the
              severed nerves took a long time to heal and were very painful if
              someone squeezed that area. A situation I did my best to keep
              secret from the bullies, but somehow one figured it out, and I was
              their target for the rest of that term, fortunately, my last
              there.</p>
            <p>Everyone had pretty much the same classes in the 7th and 8th
              grades. Except that boys had wood shop in 7th and electric shop in
              8th. Wood shop was tolerable but rather boring, I already knew how
              to use the hand tools. Electric shop was better, I learned things
              I've found useful ever after, such as how to rewire lamps. Girls
              had home economics.</p>
            <p>But in 9th grade we had electives. I took Latin which I liked. So
              many of English's word roots are from Latin. And we all liked the
              teacher, Mr. Porter. Instead of the regular English class, I took
              journalism and it helped make me a better writer. "Who, what,
              where, when, and how." Being in the class automatically put you on
              the staff of the school newspaper. Ironically I found myself the
              Boys' Sports Editor. Somewhat ironic, because few knew less about
              sports than I did. I got the position by default -- I was the only
              boy. </p>
            <p> Finally, the ordeal was over. I graduated and bade a not-so-fond
              farewell to those long, drab, halls. </p>
            <h4>High School: Metamorphasis from the Chrysalis</h4>
            <p>Before our graduation, at some assembly in the waning days of
              ninth grade, we were addressed by the high school band's director,
              Bernard Shiffrin. He told us that the band needed new members.
              Experience wasn't required, they would teach us. And that we could
              stop by the HS band room the next week and borrow an instrument
              for the year. I did that and ended up with a Scotch Bass and its
              marching harness. I walked home the three miles or so, every so
              often giving it a whack in various places and with different
              degrees of force to see how the sound changed. When my father, who
              didn't like noise, got home he was not pleased. </p>
            <p>There were a few practice sessions in the band room that summer.
              The bass drum was considered easy to play, so after a few
              sessions, I agreed to let someone they apparently thought had even
              less aptitude than I did take it. I needed to exercise my left
              hand and fingers to fully regain their use after the tendons were
              severed and repaired. I watched the snare drummers do a warm-up
              exercise where they took one end of a drumstick in each hand and
              did a rapid twisting of their wrists, reversed it, rapidly
              twisting and reversing it. [Watch "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2_rBQGt4HE">Pretzel
                video</a>." It may have been teenage male folly, but we could do
              those, one after the other, so fast that our hands were a blur.]
              That looked like good therapy, so I decided to switch to the snare
              drum instead. My father was pleased because now the bass drum was
              gone and instead I had a rubber pad to practice on with my
              drumsticks. Much less noise. </p>
            <p>I thrived in high school. [Here's a 1920 photo of BCHS. The
              school was old, but somehow cozy.<img src="BCHS.png" alt="Photo of Binghamton Central High School, Binghamton, NY"
                style="width:20%;">] There was much more freedom and less
              regimentation. I still ran into the first day "You must be a
              Thompson" bit at the beginning of semesters, but by now it didn't
              bother me. And I had a number of excellent, nurturing teachers. I
              listened closely during classes and remembered pretty well, so I
              did little note-taking. Most homework assignments I could do
              quickly. I worked hard for teachers and subjects I liked, and did
              enough to "get by" for those that I didn't like.</p>
            <p>Everyone in the concert band or the marching band (I was in both)
              loved the band director, Bernie Schifrin. He gave me a few lessons
              on how to play the drum, but he didn't have time to give many
              lessons. Playing the drums seemed to be good therapy for
              recovering the use of my severed tendons, so my parents decided to
              pay for my taking weekly private lessons from Russ Black, the
              area's premier dance band drummer.</p>
            <p>One remarkable teacher that I co-existed OK with, but didn't
              relate to was my second-year Latin teacher. She was a strict
              disciplinarian and many of the students felt she was great because
              "she makes you learn." But I wasn't built that way. However, she
              was remarkable. Not because she only seemed to have three dresses,
              which she wore in rotation, one week at a time -- but because she
              had memorized the text. She would sit at her desk, with the
              textbook in front of her, but closed, and call on a student --
              "James, please translate for us, starting at page 24, the third
              paragraph." So the student would start reading the Latin to
              himself and telling us his English translation. If he made a
              mistake, she would interrupt (still with the book closed) and say
              "Please take another look at the third word in the fifth sentence
              (or whatever)." And when the student had finished, she would
              either say something like "Very good, thank you." Or, something
              like "You can do better than that. Please do your homework
              assignments!" That year we were using a textbook version of
              Caesar's <i>De Bello Gallico</i>, so usually when I hear or read
              the name Julius Caesar, I think of her in her favorite black dress
              with the pink flowers printed on it.</p>
            <p>The school was old, but felt comfortable for me. It adjoined
              "downtown Binghamton." It had no cafeteria or lunch room, so we
              had a longer lunch hour and were allowed to go to the lunch
              counters and restaurants for lunch. My favorite was to go to
              Woolworths and get a cup of tomato soup and a grilled cheese
              sandwich. Or a hot dog. Often I brought a "brown bag" lunch and
              ate it in one of the small stairwells leading to the auditorium's
              balcony.</p>
            <p>At that time Binghamton had two high schools, I went to the older
              one Binghamton Central, which served the city's South and West
              sides. The other high school, North High, served the city's North
              and East sides. But there was also a difference in orientation.
              BCHS was academically oriented, and many East-siders who were
              college-bound transferred there. Whereas North High had a
              technical orientation, and students inclined toward an engineering
              career, transferred to North. At that time German was considered
              "the language of science" so that was the foreign language of
              choice for those technically oriented. Students at BCHS were more
              likely to opt for French or Spanish. </p>
            <p>Central High also contained a vocational school program. The
              bottom floor (a semi-basement) housed auto mechanic courses for
              boys and beauty culture courses for girls. The kids in the
              academic program looked down on the "Voc-ies" as stupid. I suspect
              the kids steered into that program were disproportionately of
              Italian or Eastern European ancestry -- the latter stereotyped as
              "dumb Polacks." </p>
            <p>There were general requirements of so much math, so much
              "English," etc., but opportunities for electives. I was on a
              "self-improvement" kick, determined to overcome my shyness, so I
              took a public speaking class and a year of dramatics as part of my
              "English" requirements. I enjoyed math, especially plane geometry,
              so I took lots of those courses. I took biology in 9th grade, but
              I needed another year of science, so I took physics and loved it.
              We had a great teacher. But my favorite subject was history. By
              12th grade, my shyness had abated to the degree that I discovered
              girls. (In preparation for that, I took lessons in ballroom
              dancing at a dance school.) And that girls weren't just pains in
              the butt who made you drink imaginary tea out of toy cups. But
              that part of the story falls into my chapter titled "Romance." </p>
            <p>My favorite teacher of all was my 12th-grade history teacher,
              Helen O'Brien. But I became very angry with her. In New York state
              we had at that time a choice between getting a "Regents' diploma"
              or a "school diploma" when we graduated. To get the latter, you
              not only had to meet various course requirements (as mentioned
              above) but also to take statewide tests of your knowledge in those
              subjects -- tests approved by the NYS Board of Regents, which was
              in charge of education. After I took my history Regents' exam and
              she'd marked it, Miss O'Brien took me aside and explained "You had
              a perfect paper and scored 100. But I couldn't turn it in that
              way. They don't accept 100s in history tests. I marked you down to
              95, but that was doing you a favor. If I had turned it in as a
              100, they would have marked it down more, to a 93 or less." I
              still expected the world to be fair, so I was very upset by the
              injustice.</p>
            <p>Few moments in my life have exceeded the recognition I got at my
              high school graduation. I had a gold tassel on my cap, to signify
              an honor student. And I was on stage a lot. Playing drums as part
              of the school band and again as part of the orchestra.&nbsp; On
              stage again in a non-speaking part as "the ragpicker" in a scene
              from the school's production of <i>The Mad Woman of Chaillot</i>.
              And up at least 3 times to receive awards. One was for an
              undeserved one for having overcome the greatest physical handicap.
              I was called to the stage for a second reward, I don't recall what
              for. And, I'm sure thanks to Miss O'Brien, called to the stage
              again, to receive the DAR award for best history student, which
              included a book on the American Revolution. And, of course, I was
              called up once more to receive my diploma.</p>
            <h4>College: "Let each become all that he is capable of being.”<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
                href="#Meritocracy"></a></h4>
            <p>I had always assumed that I would go to college. As I suspect,
              did most of my teachers. But where and what to study?</p>
            <p>I had long abandoned my earliest aspirations -- becoming a
              cowboy, fireman or steam shovel operator. But what? </p>
            <p>As a teenager, my first answer would have been "archeologist." By
              thirteen I had read every book in our public library on archeology
              about the Mayas. And many on the archeology of other places and
              times.</p>
            <p>My mother had a lot of confidence in the wisdom of a somewhat
              frequent house guest, a distant cousin, the Rev. Canon <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Essex-404">Edward
                Claude Essex</a>, of Cambridge U. So she urged me to consult
              with him on career advice. He strongly encouraged me to forget the
              idea of a career in archeology -- "It's a rich man's game." I
              expect that was good advice -- for the England of his time and the
              Cambridge - Oxford milieu he lived in. But one of my college
              classmates and friend, Phil Hobler, went on to a successful career
              in it and became department chair at Simon Fraser U. in Vancouver.
              He didn't have an easy time getting established in that field but
              persisted. Arguably if I had had an equal passion for the field I
              wouldn't have let someone talk me out of it so easily.</p>
            <p>Another possibility was forestry. My brother Hank attended
              Syracuse U. for a couple of years. The State University of New
              York's College of Forestry is located on the Syracuse U. campus.
              So, he taught me their song (sung to the tune of "There's a Tavern
              in the Town"):</p>
            <blockquote> I said I'd go to Syracuse, Syracuse<br>
              And when they asked me what's the use, what's the use<br>
              I said "Just wait four years and you will see, when I have studied
              forestry, forestry.<br>
              <br>
              "I'll learn the name of fish and bugs, fish and bugs<br>
              "Of birds and butterflies and slugs, flies and slugs.<br>
              And the names of trees will never bother me<br>
              When I have studied forestry, forestry.<br>
              "Silviculture I will master, I will put out fires faster<br>
              "and learn to use the compass and the calipers.<br>
              Etc. </blockquote>
            <p>That had a lot of appeal for me. </p>
            <p>I got a good score on the SATs - not phenomenal, but good enough
              to earn me a "Regents' Scholarship. It was only $200/semester,
              which sounds paltry now, but at that time was the cost of the
              tuition at any S.U.N.Y campus. Soon after, I got letters from Le
              Moyne College, a well-regarded Catholic school near Syracuse, and
              one from Cornell U. in Ithaca, NY. They were offering an
              additional scholarship to winners of Regent Scholarships, making
              up the difference between their tuition and SUNY's. I now had full
              tuition to two more colleges. Le Moyne had a lot of rules I wasn't
              comfortable with -- e.g. I think at that time all students were
              expected to attend mass daily, which as a Protestant didn't appeal
              -- going to church once a week seemed often enough.</p>
            <p>Cornell was very tempting, a wonderful opportunity. And so was
              the state forestry college. But we had no college fund built up,
              and federal student grant or loan programs didn't yet exist, so
              the colleges' fees and room and board seemed unattainable, so I
              settled for the local SUNY campus, Harpur College. I could reach
              it via local buses. It turned out to be a good choice for me.</p>
            <p>The passage of the G.I. Bill at the end of WW2 created a big
              demand for increased capacity. Many colleges expanded and new ones
              sprang up. To meet the demand, Syracuse U. opened an extension
              branch, Triple Cities<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#TripleCities"></a>
              College, in Binghamton. My eldest brother, Tom, graduated from
              there. But SUNY wanted to expand, so they purchased Triple Cities
              College, renamed it Harpur, and moved it to a temporary campus in
              Endicott, NY while searching for a permanent site. One lovely old
              home was purchased and became "Colonial Hall" </p>
            <figure><img src="Harpur_ColonialHall.jpg" alt="Photo Harpur College's Colonial Hall, the admin building."
                style="width:20%; float: left;"><figcaption>Colonial Hall</figcaption></figure>
            the college's administration building. Plus across from Colonial
            Hall was a triangular block that was a village park. SUNY bought
            most of the homes facing the park. One, "Park House"
            <figure><img src="Harpur_ParkHouse.jpg" alt="Photo of 'Park House, the nice classroom building on the Harpur College campus."

            was for classrooms and the others became dorms. The rest of the
            classrooms were plywood pre-fabs, built on a corner of Endicott's
            landfill.

                style="width:20%; float: right;"><figcaption>West Hall</figcaption></figure>
            I well remember the prefabs. The windows didn't fit well, and in dry
            weather, dust from the landfill would filter through and get on your
            books and papers. Worse, when it was snowing, snowflakes came
            through the window frames and if you were taking a test using a "<a
              href="">bluebook</a>," some of the snowflakes would land on your
            essay answers, causing the ink from your fountain pens to run and
            make your answer hard to read. <a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"

            <p>Liberal Arts were ideal for me. The intent was to produce
              well-rounded<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#WellRounded"></a>
              people, with the basic knowledge of many areas, and, as mentioned
              previously, the skills in learning, research and communication to
              be able to specialize in a wide variety of fields. I didn't enter
              college with any clear cut-carer path in mind. But, as history
              seemed to be my best subject I expected to major in history.
              Ironically, however, as things turned out, I took many history
              courses -- art history, music history, the history of French
              literature, the history of philosophy, etc. Somehow I ended up
              never having taken a single course from the actual History
              Department. Not surprisingly in light of that, I was not a history
              major.</p>
            <p>On Freshman registration day, I tried to enroll in History 101.
              But the lines were long and the class sizes small, so by the time
              I presented my requests, every section of History 101 was filled.
              Nothing that was left seemed particularly appealing, so, almost
              randomly, I ended up taking Philosophy 101, Introduction to
              Philosophy, instead.</p>
            <p>The teacher, <a href="https://prabook.com/web/jack.kaminsky/313133">Jack
                Kaminsky</a>, was charismatic, a natural showman, but was not
              all sizzle -- there was plenty of steak. His specialty was
              symbolic logic, but he had a far-ranging mind. He asked questions
              that were far ahead of 1954. The first organ transplant was
              performed that year, but he had the class discuss "At what point
              would you stop being you?" We were asked to assume that someday
              organ transplants, joint replacements, etc. would be common. If
              each part was replaced, one by one, would you still be you? And
              what if someone's memories could someday be uploaded into a
              computer, would that still be them? All sorts of advanced ideas.
              It was then being discovered that important processing was done by
              nerve cells in our viscera. That having a "gut feel" might be more
              than just an expression. And possibly by other nerves, not in our
              brain. Where then was our "mind?" Was the mind just electrical
              activity in the brain, or were other parts of our nervous system
              incorporated into our mind? He brought up areas still not well
              understood about plant communication and plant behavior. I wished
              I had the requisite background to make serious studies of plant
              psychology.</p>
            <p>I had planned on taking History 101 the next semester. But it was
              a small school, with a small faculty, so it wouldn't be offered
              until the next fall. I don't remember the details, but my attempt
              to enroll in it then came to naught. Going two years without a
              course from that department, made majoring in history unlikely.
              But I enjoyed the courses I was taking in algebra and geometry, so
              becoming a math major seemed a good choice. And math was a good
              background for all sorts of stuff. In the meantime, I chugged away
              at meeting the requirements of getting so many credits in this
              department and that many credits in another department, and
              without consciously realizing it,&nbsp; was taking many, many
              "History of ..." courses from various departments.</p>
            <p>I made many lifelong friendships there. Unfortunately, only a few
              of those friends are still alive. But those were good years and I
              was very active in extracurricular activities. I became president
              of a service fraternity of ex boy scouts. We provided guides for
              families wanting to take campus tours, ushers for events, proctors
              for tests, etc. The school didn't have a real orchestra or band,
              but in my first year there I played in the pep band, making noise
              at basketball games. (But that wasn't very interesting or
              challenging.) I was an avid backpacker, canoeist, etc. but didn't
              have a car, so I organized the Harpur Outing Club to get the
              school to provide transportation and became its president. And I
              became editor of the college literary magazine. And participated
              in Math Club and French Club.</p>
            <p>Things kind of chugged along from semester to semester. Mostly
              meeting the school's demanding, but general requirements of x
              number of credits in a foreign language, y credits in science, z
              credits in math, etc. I selected courses guided by which
              professors I wanted to study under. And what courses sounded
              interesting. There wasn't a separate dining room for faculty, and
              I sometimes shared a snack bar table with one or more of the
              faculty. Or, I couldn't help but hear their conversations at an
              adjacent table. </p>
            <p>I found myself taking a philosophy course most of the time,
              especially from my favorite in the department, Richard Burgener,
              an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology">epistomologist</a>
              and all-around great guy. One of those courses was from Jack
              Kaminsky, this time in his field, symbolic logic.</p>
            <p>In our junior year, we were supposed to declare a major. I chose
              math. We had to write a senior paper in our major. I was studying
              Boolean algebra, under an algebraist, and planning to write my
              senior paper in that field. But, as my junior year ended he left.
              And he was the only algebraist on the faculty. All who were left
              were in the field of "analysis" -- calculus or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/about-pure-math/what-is-pure-math/what-is-topology#:%7E:text=Topology%20studies%20properties%20of%20spaces,but%20a%20figure%208%20cannot.">topology</a>.</p>
            <p>What to do? I didn't want to work under any of the other math
              professors<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#MathBully"></a>,
              none of them were really interested in algebra. But Boolean
              algebra and symbolic logic were closely related. So, counting up
              my philosophy credits and finding I had enough, I changed my major
              to philosophy. In talking with a dean in order to make the switch,
              I was surprised that the courses I took from the French department
              on "The Age of Voltaire", History of French Lit, etc. added up to
              a minor. So I was now a Philo major with minors in math and
              French.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#FrenchDreams"></a></p>
            <p>I worked hard at learning what I wanted to learn. I worked the
              hardest on a course we didn't get credit for. I signed up for a
              philosophy seminar on a topic that we didn't get credit for. Too
              few students signed up for it, so the school canceled it. Those of
              us who had signed up for it talked the prof into giving it anyway.
              It was a seminar, so the students did most of the work. He agreed
              to hold it, but only if we promised to keep up with our
              assignments. I worked the hardest ever on that course that "didn't
              count." But I was pursuing knowledge, not glory.</p>
            <p>I was also pursuing girls, which didn't help my grades, and which
              gradually declined in my sophomore and junior years, to the point
              where I got a notice from the dean that I was in danger of
              flunking out. I buckled down for my senior year and brought them
              up enough to graduate.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, I turned my senior thesis in late, and even though
              my eventual grade was fine, it came too late for me to participate
              in that June's commencement. They just mailed me my degree.&nbsp;

                Motion</a>?”</h5>
            <p>I graduated in the middle of a recession. I had achieved my goal
              of gaining a broad range of knowledge. But not surprisingly, there
              was no demand for people with a BA in "Humanities." And no job ads
              that read "Inexperienced philosopher wanted." I had always
              expected that my career prep would come in grad school, but I had
              no savings, little prospect of getting a large enough scholarship,
              and my father was almost retirement age. The best job offer I got
              was for $20/week, which even back then was a pittance.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
                href="#Providence"></a> When I interviewed with a company I'd
              had a summer job with, the interviewer said "You've got a lot of
              math courses, and, if you take a course in statistics, I think
              we'll have a place for you." So, that fall I took a statistics
              course at Harpur and took some part-time jobs, including
              substitute teaching. At the end of the semester, they hired me in
              a full-time job and sent me to a whole bunch of classes at a
              nearby IBM education center, and trained me in data processing,
              and managing it. It was good training and I enjoyed it. A couple
              of years later, they found themselves in financial trouble, so I
              reapplied with the guy who advised me to take statistics. They
              hired me and sent me to another bunch of IBM classes on
              programming and frequently sent me to conferences and seminars.
              They knew that was key to making me happy.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Harpur College had morphed into SUNY Binghamton (later
              Binghamton U.), and had opened some grad schools, one of them
              being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson">Thomas

                style="width:20%; float: left;"> I took a couple of math courses
              and a computer science class there at night. After a few years, I
              decided I was ready for more grad school, and applied to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehigh_University">Lehigh

                href="#LehighU"></a> My employer had a division near Lehigh U.,
              so I took a leave of absence from my Binghamton job and took a
              temporary transfer to that division. I attended Lehigh for two
              years and almost finished, but my Binghamton job needed to
              retrieve me or replace me. I had a wonderful boss, so I went back,
              hoping to finish my degree remotely. But the time demands of work
              prevented that. Nevertheless, I learned a lot and didn't feel the
              time and effort were wasted.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#AfterLehigh"></a>

            <p>Now that I'm retired, I have time to take courses and am enjoying
              the non-credit offerings of the <a href="https://www.lvilr.org/">Lehigh

              with <a href="https://www.cedarcrest.edu/">Cedar Crest College</a>
              in Allentown, PA. Currently, I'm enjoying a course on major ideas
              in biology.</p>
            <p>And my family history website and blog constantly involve me in
              learning more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, web page design, web
              design friendly to the visually challenged, etc. The web
              environment is continually changing and there are always new
              things to learn.</p>
            <p>By now you can see that I truly view education as a lifelong
              process and still love learning. </p>

            <li id="EdTrain">As I use the words, <b><i>training</i></b> tries
              to impart specific skills and provides "recipes" or "cookbooks" on
              how to perform those tasks. At one end of the spectrum you have
              apprenticeship programs trade schools, and certification programs
              to demonstrate competence in particular areas -- plumbing,
              welding, etc. At the other end, <b><i>education</i></b>, you have
              areas of generalized knowledge, learning how to learn, how to
              research topics, how to think logically, how to communicate
              effectively, etc. The epitome of this may be liberal arts, where
              you learn a little about a lot of things -- a kind of "jack of all
              trades, master of none," but theoretically have the skills to
              explore other areas as needed or desired. The waters may seem
              muddied by the existence of "professional degrees" such as MD, DO,
              DDS, JD for lawyers, DD for clergy, Doctor of Ed for school
              administrators, but I see those as high levels of training. That's
              not intended to disparage them in the slightest. <br>
              One difference is concrete mileposts. Training involves specific
              endpoints, which once achieved, you can "ply your trade."
              Refresher courses may me needed from time to time, but "big
              picture" it's somewhat&nbsp; binary. Obviously individuals differ
              as to skill level, but to some degree you either have the needed
              skills or you don't. Perhaps more importantly, the goals of the
              two are different. I see education as a never-ending process -
              somewhat like maturing. We never finish “growing up.” No matter
              how much personal growth one achieves, there are almost infinite
              opportunities for more growth. I see education as a never ending
              process and am still working at it. Both on my own and by taking
              classes. At the moment I'm taking a course titled "Big Ideas In
              Biology." </li>
            <li id="Planning">At least with careful planning.</li>
            <li id="CorpPun">I don't believe that corporal punishment is a good
              idea. Multiple studies show that positive reinforcement is more
              effective than negative reinforcement. Corporal punishment imparts
              the lessons that "Might is right" and that "Violence is the
              answer."</li>
            <li id="SoundingOut"> BTW, most people I encounter in the Allentown,
              PA area, don’t know how to sound out words. When people see my
              address, “Pericles Place,” they have no idea how to pronounce it.
              Or how to spell it if they hear the word. Which shows they either
              didn’t ever study Athenian history or if they did, didn’t pay
              attention. Or forgot. We studied it in Binghamton in my day.
              Moreover, many pharmacy staff and medical office personnel
              processing a list of what medications you take don't know how to
              pronounce medications they aren’t familiar with. It’s too bad they
              never were taught how to "sound out" words. I suspect that's the
              case in many areas, not just here.</li>
            <li id="Bookcase">As for the bookcase, I put that to good use,
              storing books I wasn’t carrying around. As an adult, it was good
              for putting on a table top and filling with paperbacks. I used it
              for 75 years until moving to a smaller place and having to give it
              away. Hopefully someone is still getting good use from it.</li>
            <li id="TompkinsMove">I assume that we moved back into the city so
              that the family would have bus service. My father had taken a job
              with the Martin Aircraft Company at the plant on Sparrows Point,
              MD, making B-26 bombers and, with several co-workers, had rented
              an apartment in Baltimore. My mother didn't like to drive and had
              surrendered her license years earlier. Tom was in the army, so
              Hank was the only driver in the household. and gasoline rationing
              had started. Getting on a bus route would have been a good reason
              for the move.</li>

                style="width:20%; float: right;">Third grade marked a major
              milestone -- writing with ink instead of pencil. That was a big
              deal, with lots of components and ritual. First were the inkwells.
              Every desk had a circular hole in the top that contained a glass
              inkwell. They had to be filled. Only the most responsible kids
              were given the awesome task of going from desk to desk with a
              large bottle of ink, filling their classmates' ink well. Splashing
              even a little could ruin someone's clothes. The pens came in two
              pieces. Small steel nibs (pen points). And long, wooden pen nib
              holders that you held in your hand to write. Accompanied by
              flannel pen wipes. After inserting a nib into a holder, you would
              dip the nib into the ink well, use the pen wipe to remove excess
              ink and start writing. one dip into the inkwell might fuel one or
              two sentences. And woe unto any girl with braids who sat in front
              of a boy. At least if her braids were long enough to be dipped
              into his ink well. Not all boys would do that -- but many did.
              Note that the nib has a "keyhole" shaped hole that would hold a
              large drop of ink. And that the end of the nib was split. That
              served two purposes. The main one was to deliver ink from the drop
              in the keyhole to the paper. And second, by applying more pressure
              to the point of the nib you could produce a wider line. And if
              there was a mishap, your trusty blotter hopefully would clean up
              the mess.</li>

            <li id="Meritocracy">Who can disagree with wanting to help people
              achieve their full potential? But there is a downside.
              "Meritocracy" sounds very fair. And efficient. Before Pres. Chi,
              China aspired to be a technocratic meritocracy. But there's a
              downside. See Michael J. Sandel's <i><a href="https://jmp.princeton.edu/events/tyranny-merit-whats-become-common-good">The
                  Tyranny of Merit: What's Become of the Common Good?</a></i></li>
            <li id="TripleCities">The three adjacent communities, Binghamton,
              Johnson City and Endicott, were collectively known as "The Triple
              Cities". Technically, Johnson City and Endicott, were villages,
              not cities, but they were big enough to be cities if they'd wanted
              to be.</li>
            <li id="CollegeDesign">More important than a campus' buildings are
              its faculty, its students, and its policies and attitudes. Harpur
              was designed to be a prestigious liberal arts college. Much of its
              faculty was recruited from the U. of Chicago and much of the
              curriculum was based on Chicago's Great Books approach. The
              students were selected by an elaborate quota policy. As I recall
              the male/female ration was designed to be 60% vs 40%. Something
              like 45% were to come from the counties immediately surrounding
              Binghamton; another 45% from the greater NYC metropolitan area,
              and the remainder from the rest of the state, other states and
              other countries -- each according to a fixed percent. It seemed
              very precise, very arbitrary, and of course meant that girls
              needed a higher GPA to get in than boys. And to make it
              prestigious, the first year was designed to eliminate 1/3 of each
              freshman class. I hadn't had to work hard in high school, but I
              was worried about the competition, so I worked my butt off that
              first year and made the Dean's List. (And then slacked off.) </li>
            <li id="WellRounded">These days I am too "well-rounded." :)</li>
            <li id="MathBully">Many of the math faculty were arrogant, proud of
              their status as "pure mathematicians." As opposed to "applied
              mathematicians" who concerned themselves with lowly tasks such as
              helping engineers and physicsts solve problems. One incident stuck
              in my memory. The most arrogant, very proud of his academic
              credentials, was a bully. He would pick on a weak student
              mercilessly. He also happened to have cerebral palsy, which had
              left him with a withered arm. One day he made the mistake of
              picking on a much bigger guy, who was a Korean War veteran. The
              vet stood up, gathered his books, and before storming out of the
              room declared "I don't care if you are a God damned cripple. If
              you ever talk to me like that again, I'll come up there and knock
              your teeth out." Those of us who had gone directly from high
              school to college were flabbergasted by the vet's courage.&nbsp;
              He did return to the class the next session, but was never picked
              on again. And passed the course.</li>
            <li id="FrenchDreams">I never became a fluent conversationalist in
              French. But I could read novels, literature from the time of
              Chaucer, newspapers and articles in technical journals published
              in French. I had 7 semesters of French and, at one point,
              sometimes even dreamed in French. But it did help in reading
              signs, menus, etc. on my visits to La Province de Québec -- even
              though the vocabulary of Québécois French had significant
              differences from what I'd studied.</li>
            <li id="Providence">I wasn't worried. My raised Catholic, turned
              Presbyterian father had a strong belief in divine providence --
              "The Lord will provide." I didn't share his confidence about that,
              but was nevertheless confident that with "Where there's a will
              there's a way" -- combined with flexibility and a willingness to "<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem">carpe diem</a>,"
              things would work out.</li>
            <li id="WatsonIrony"> Computers played a significant role in my
              careers. Harpur, which in my undergraduate day was in one of the
              communities that claim to be birthplaces of IBM. The campus was
              only a few blocks from IBM factories and Education Centers. IBM's
              founder and CEO, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson">Thomas
                J. Watson</a>, had offered to donate land for their new campus,
              an offer which was turned down. It seems ironic therefore, given
              that never in my 4 undergraduate years did I hear the word
              'computer' even mentioned [except for Jack Kaminsky's speculations
              about uploading someone's memories] that my education turned out
              to have provided the foundation for my careers. When I was an
              undergrad, Harpur's math department was proud of its orientation
              towards "pure mathematics" [i.e. the study of principles without
              much practical application] and scornful of "applied mathematics"
              [i.e. math used in practical applications in day-to-day life].
              They would never have considered in Newton's methods for numerical
              analysis. Even though that branch of math, invented by Sir Isaac
              Newton, was useless until computers were invented. So, sharing a
              campus with an engineering school (let alone one named after
              Watson) must have been a bitter pill to swallow.</li>
            <li id="LehighU">The field of Information Science was under way and
              that appealed to me. Interesting programs were offered by Drexel
              U. in Philadelphia, and Lehigh U. in Bethlehem, PA. At that time I
              was working in Binghamton, but providing scientific computing
              services to company divisions throughout the country. One division
              had a research facility near Bethlehem and I became friends with
              one of the scientists there and discussed my grad school hopes
              with him. He tried to talk me into going to his alma mater,
              Villanova, but I wanted to just take a temporary transfer to his
              location. That worked out, I applied to Lehigh and was accepted.
              My employer agreed to a temporary leave of absence from my current
              position, a transfer to the PA location at half time &amp;
              half-pay, retention of all my seniority etc., and they had a
              tuition reimbursement policy, and would pay for the moves, so I
              moved to PA. Unfortunately, they had a reimbursement policy, which
              only covered one course per semester. I took two courses a
              semester. So, with a family to support, rent for an apartment,
              etc. Lehigh's high tuition made for few frills. I like pretzels,
              which S.E. PA has many great producers thereof and was delighted
              to discover that a nearby bakery made large, stick pretzels. And
              that their outlet store would fill a large grocery bag with broken
              pretzels for 5¢.</li>
            <li id="AfterLehigh">Once back, I continued attending events like
              the <a href="https://www.acm.org/">ACM</a>'s annual conference,
              weekend seminars, and both taking short courses at work taught by
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_Institute_of_Technology">RIT</a>
              statistics faculty and teaching some courses at work on
              programming and statistics. And subscribed to many technical and
              professional journals and was active in societies in Applied
              Statistics, Computing, Quality Control, and Photographic Science.
              I also taught programming courses at a local community college
              nights. And took a number of courses from the American Management
              Association.
              <p>Along the way, I picked up some certifications: the Data
                Processing Management Association's "Certified Data Processor"
                and APICS (then the American Production and Inventory Control
                Society, now renamed the Association for Supply Chain
                Management)'s "Certified Practitioner of Inventory Management"
                and taught courses for their exams. </p>

            <li id="CareerChapter">More on all that in my chapter on "Careers".</li>
            <li id="Conferences"> Conferences were great because they allowed me
              to meet, and converse with many of the computer science greats.
              Such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace
                Hopper</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie">Dennis

                Presper Eckert</a>, and many others. Especially valuable was a
              chat several of us had with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_E._Iverson">Ken
                Iverson</a>, inventor of the APL programming language. It
              extended through a long luncheon conversation during which he
              covered the paper "table cloth" with illustrations of his ideas
              and insights -- e.g. that every computer program is a mathematical
              function (at lest for procedural programming languages.)</li>
