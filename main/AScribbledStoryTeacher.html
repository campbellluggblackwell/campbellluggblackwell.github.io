            <p>I applied to teach at a school north of Brainerd near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrifield,_Minnesota">Merrifield</a>.
              I was accepted, so my first year was spent there. I roomed and
              boarded with a rural family who had three sons. The two oldest
              went to my school. </p>
            <p>All was going well, until one night when I was taken with a
              severe pain in my right side. We telephoned for my mother and she
              came from my old home south of Brainerd to the home where I
              boarded, about six miles north of Brainerd, something like twelve
              miles or so between the two places. </p>
            <p>I was in such severe pain that we surmised I probably had
              appendicitis. We had no idea the appendix was ruptured. Mother
              heated a pan of water on top of Mrs. Jordan's stove, put some
              turpentine in it and wrung small towels or wash clothes out of
              this mixture and placed them on my sore side. When they would
              cool, I would beg my mother to wring out the cloth again and so we
              kept hot towels on my pain. We learned the next <span class="Annotation">[day]</span>
              after the doctor saw me that we were doing the wrong thing.</p>
            <p><img src="doctorsandsurgery.svg" alt="Drawing of doctors operating"

                style="width:20%;" <a="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu">Spanish
              influenza was raging all around our area, so the doctor we called
              had gone many miles to minister to flu patients. We could not get
              him in our area until about eleven o'clock in the morning. He took
              one look at me and said, "I should have had this girl yesterday.
              We will have to operate on her as fast as we can arrange it." The
              truth was that my appendix had burst and I was in serious
              condition. I was carried to Brainerd to the Northwestern Hospital
              and was operated on at two o'clock that afternoon. I was in really
              serious condition. Gangrene had set in and the doctor would give
              my family no real hopes for three days.</p>
            <p>It so happened that my time in the hospital coincided with two
              things -- one was the usual Christmas vacation and the other was
              that many schools were being closed because of the influenza.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"

                href="#SpanishFlu"></a> Well, God was good to me. I was healed
              and back at my job of teaching after a few weeks. </p>
            <p>The next school year (1920) I taught <span class="Annotation">[at]</span>
              my old home school, where I had gone to school myself for all
              eight grades. Today, over seventy years later, I hear from some of
              the pupils I taught that year.</p>
            <p>I think I will recount one incident which will show how
              experiences are linked together. One day (in 1920) a little girl,
              about ten years old, came to me and said, "Teacher, the big boys
              are teasing little Jerrold." I said "Don't tell me more. Let me go
              out and catch them." I went out and sure enough,the big boys
              (probably twelve or thirteen years of age) were tormenting six
              year old Jerrold. They had pulled at him, pulling at his clothing
              until a large button had been pulled off his trousers and lay on
              the ground nearby. I scolded the boys, told them to go into the
              schoolroom and sit in their school seats. I also picked up the
              button. "Now, boys," I said, "You should be ashamed of yourselves.
              What you have been doing is not good fun and certainly is not good
              clean sport. I want you to remain after school and think about
              what you have been doing. If you behave like this as boys, you
              will grow into manhood such that no one will really like you.
              Furthermore boys, I want you to sew this button back on Jerrold's
              trousers." I handed them needle and thread and the button. The
              boys sewed it back in place. I kept the boys after school for
              several nights. Then, on Friday night, after giving them another
              "talking to" I dismissed them. They came to the door and said
              "Goodnight Mary."</p>
            <p>I should have told you that because all of the children in this
              school had grown up with me, they knew me as "Mary." I refused to
              be called "Teacher" and I though<span class="Annotation">[t]</span>
              it foolish for me to insist they call me "Miss Hughey" since we
              had been friends and neighbors for many years. I said "Goodnight,
              boys." and so we parted as friends that afternoon. Today Jerrold
              and his wife Myrtle, are among my best friends. </p>
            <p>We had many wonderful times in our neighborhood that school year.
              At Christmas time we gave a really good program for the entire
              neighborhood. Later on that same year, we put on a play, getting
              older young people in the neighborhood to take part. The name of
              the play was "<a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24133217M/Hans_von_Smash">
                Hans Von Smash</a>." Maybe it is yet remembered by old timers. </p>
            <p>My next term of teaching was in a consolidated school in the town
              of Deerwood where my sister's home was. I taught intermediate
              grades, the third and fourth, in that school and I also taught
              penmanship in some of the other rooms. </p>
            <p>By that time I had "saved," with the idea of going on to further
              education. So, the next fall found me in Moorehead, Minnesota at
              Moorehead State Teacher's College. I graduated from that
              institution the spring of 1922. Before I left M.S.T.C. I had been
              accepted as a teacher in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickinson,_North_Dakota">Dickinson,
                North Dakota</a>. I had planned to teach in Minnesota, but the
              director of the training school at M.S.T.C. had insisted on my
              applying for the work at Dickinson. The superintendent in
              Dickinson had asked Moorehead Teacher's College to supply a
              teacher and i was urged to apply. I taught in Dickinson for two
              years.</p>
            <p>Next, I applied to teach in Minneapolis and to my surprise and
              satisfaction, I was chosen without a personal interview, contrary
              to the usual custom. I taught only one year in Minneapolis for
              circumstances seemed to indicate that I should stay for a year or
              so with my family in Brainerd. </p>
            <p>My brother Harry had broken his engagement with the girl we
              thought he would marry. It was an upsetting thing for him and for
              my mother. My father had died March 29, 1923 and Harry had been
              trying to carry on the work on our farm. Mother, of course,
              depended on Harry.</p>
            <p>That year I stayed home was a busy one for me. I organized the
              girl and the young women of our neighborhood into a club we named
              "The Daughters of the Soil ."<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#DaughtersSoil"></a>
              We tried to promote a varied program. Some of it was an attempt to
              learn more about things a farm wife should know, such as canning
              or preserving farm products. We learned about producing a good
              breed of chickens and their care. We gave a Mother and Daughters'
              Banquet. I remember that as being a great way to learn a number of
              things. We put on a play in the town hall that was enjoyed by the
              entire neighborhood. </p>
            <p>I decided to get back into the role of teaching, so I applied to
              the city of Brainerd and was hired. I taught in the Brained
              Schools for three years. </p>
