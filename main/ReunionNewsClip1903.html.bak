          <p>The annual reunion of the Campbell and Hazlett families was held in
            Nelson, Aug. 14th. The day was a perfect one. About 1 o'clock the
            people were seated. Rev. John Davies returned thanks and the dinner
            was served. There was an abundance of good things to eat, good
            music, good speaking and good will every where. Although the
            attendance was not as great as last year, every one agreed that it
            was a most enjoyable day. There were some new faces among them, and
            five of those who were with us last year have joined the great
            reunion on the other side. They are <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Knapp-4325">Mrs.
              Kate Hazlett</a>, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dunham-434">Mrs.

              G.<span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> Congdon</a> sang two
            numbers which were heartily applauded. "Blest be the tie that binds"
            was sung for the opening hymn and "The Campbell Reunion" composed<sup>2</sup>
            by Mrs. <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel Shipman</a> Shaw the
            closing number. Much credit is due the retiring officers, M. B.
            Seely, T. C. Campbell and E. C. Blackwell. The Officers for next
            year are: E. B. Campbell, President; J. D. Campbell, Secretary; M.
            B. Seely, Treasurer. It is sincerely hoped that many of those who
            were absent will meet with us next year. Layfayette Roundsville of
            West Bay City, Mich., an old friend of the Campbell family, is
            visiting friends in this vicinity. He made and received a hearty
            welcome from all. C. H. Congdon made a pleasant addition to our
            number this year. The venerable Dr. A. M. Loop<sup>3</sup> made a
            few remarks that touched the hearts of all who heard him.</p>
