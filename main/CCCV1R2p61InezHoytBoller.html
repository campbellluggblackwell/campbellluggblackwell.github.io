        appreciated and enjoyed their lovely home and hospitality. Those who

      <p> How nice that Cousins <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html"> Ed Congdon</a>'s

    <div class="Message">
      <p> Seems to me we should be getting ready now for our next meeting at <a
          href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie Congdon</a>'s home in East
        Stroudsburg in 1924. We can all go if only we get busy. My husband,
        William, offered to take our truck and take the whole tribe and could
        easily do so, except he might ask you to chip in on gas; aside from
        that, transportation is free. <span class="Annotation"> [In her June
          11, 1923 CCC letter, Inez mentions her husband having a truck made by
          the Reo Company. I've seen pictures of his truck, circa 1920. It
          appears to be the same truck I saw on visits to his farm in the 1940s.
          It was a flat bed with stake sides. He used it for his milk route,
          picking up milk cans at dairy farms near Nelson and taking them to a
          creamery in Elkland. It boggles my mind to think of 10 to 20
          "Cousins", who were then in their 60s and 70s, riding all day sitting
          in the back, on the floor bed or chairs sliding around --- exposed to
          sun, wind, and if had bad luck, rain. -wbt]</span></p>
      <p> It is so cold here today I am thinking of making a coal fire, although
        the autumn has been very nice and the trees gorgeous in their new fall
        clothes and very beautiful. </p>
      <p>I hope to go to Elmira this month as my birthday is October 12th- <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1276">
          Elizabeth</a>'s October 17th and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1278">Joseph</a>,
        Elizabeth's little son, is October 31st We met there last year on
        Elizabeth's birthday and had a sort of family birthday party and
        jollification.</p>

        and family were home in August. The little folks enjoyed the farm and
        were very busy all the time; her eldest is a kindergarten young man this
        year, but expects to come next summer and help in haying. Elizabeth has
        not been here for nearly a year. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1285">Isabelle</a>
        comes a little more frequently as she is nearer and can do so.</p>
      <p>I am looking forward anxiously for the letters and photos. I fully
        realize the work this makes Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will
