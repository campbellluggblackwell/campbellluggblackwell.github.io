        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        I received a letter from Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will
        Selph</a> asking me to write a letter for the Cousins Correspondence. I
        became interested in the Cousins Letters through reading the books
        which my mother has.
      </p>
<p>
        I am living on the farm where I was born, the <span wc_id="I722">
        O. A. Van Dusen</span> farm in Farmington <span class="Annotation">[Twp]</span>. I have three boys <span wc_id="I1414">
        Hugh</span>, eighteen years of age, who lives with my mother, <a href="TubbsAnn1855.html">Ann Van Dusen</a>, at Osceola, and attends school
        at Elkland, and <span wc_id="I1416">
        George</span> and <span wc_id="I1430">
        Wallace</span>, fourteen and twelve years respectively, who live at home.
      </p>
<p>
        Our family has been bereaved by the death of our brother, <span wc_id="I1448">
        Ross</span>, who left us on December 1, 1924, after he had been ill with
        meningitis for but a short time. It was he who sent the letter for our
        family last time. His <span wc_id="I1449">
        widow</span> and two daughters live in the home which they had just
        completed at Elkland.
      </p>
<p>
        I am glad that this generation is to be included in the Cousins
        Correspondence. It will help us to get better acquainted.
      </p>
