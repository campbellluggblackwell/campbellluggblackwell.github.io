      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Below is a transcription of what
          apparently was an insert for the Order of Service for the Nelson
          Community Church --- or possibly a transcription from the original.
          The copy I typed this from bore the inscription "Tho't maybe you'd
          like to know this!" I'm not sure who sent it to me, perhaps Cousin
          Ande RICE Tubbs. The reason it would have interested me that it
          mentions: my ggf, Rev. Henry Goodrich, who was pastor there when it
          was a Methodist Church before the building was moved from the South
          Side; my grandmother, Frances GOODRICH Hoyt; and my mother's 1st
          cousin, Ruth TUBBS Krise. It also mentions Campbell (also Lugg) Cousin
          Burton R. Rice, his wife, Clairbel BOYCE Rice, and their children:
          Eileen RICE Shepherd Harris, Dortha RICE Davenport, &amp; Robert W.
          Rice. Moreover, it also mentions a group of our Blackwell Cousins
          (that particular branch also being Luggs).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ---

        2. There were so many people named "Enoch Blackwell" that it makes it
        hard to be sure which ones are being referred to if no middle name is
        given.There also are many "Mary Blackwell"s and several "Caroline
        Blackwell"s. Where no middle name is given, I have guessed at which
        seemed most likely --- wbt.</span> </div>
