      <p>Dear Campbell Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> This spring finds the Young family particularly good health, enjoying
        unusually fine New England weather in a new home. Last November we moved
        to another part of Wellesley Hills where we had bought a house and are
        now experiencing a good deal of amusement watching flowers and shrubs,
        which were planted by some one else, coming through the ground. Being
        unable personally to tell a daffodil from a cauliflower, I shall have to
        wait for the finished article before I shall know what we have. The past
        two weeks have found me using all my spare time picking leaves out of
        the barberry hedge. For every leaf extracted I have acquired a painful
        pricker, and with great relief announce that the hedge is almost
        cleared. One daffodil is already through, the shrubs are all in leaf and
        two flowering quince trees look very promising. </p>
      <p> My older son, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1509">Phillip
          Pratt Young</a>, has just achieved a pen and the use of ink in school,
        a very important milestone with him. His younger brother, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1515">John
          Campbell Young</a>, has had his supper in bed the last two nights in
        the expectation that some of his runaway activities might be curtailed.

        adds to her household duties at least one afternoon a week bowling in a
        women's tournament and one or two afternoons at bridge. We both bowl in
        an evening mixed tournament and are both pretty punk. Her mother, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1508">Mrs.
          Daniel T. Pratt</a> of Elmira, has spent most of the winter with us. </p>
      <p> I made my usual trip to Europe this winter, spending some time in
        Paris, Berlin, Chemnitz and London. While in Paris I was disappointed to
        find that <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1478">Harry
          Campbell</a> and family had gone to Nice, where he was studying with
        the famous singer, Jean DeReske<sup>1</sup>, who recently died. Many
        people have asked me if Germany is coming back. My unhesitating answer
        is that Germany has come back. I saw there no signs of unemployment, all
        mills were running full time or overtime, the city shops and department
        stores were doing a big business, the theatres, and particularly grand
        opera, were patronized to their capacity at high prices, and it is said
        that some American movie stars find working in Germany better pay than
        Hollywood. I suppose their greatest want in Germany, and the only thing
        they really suffer from, is the lack of motor cars, largely due to the
        fact that Fords are excluded. Naturally, having no army or navy to pay
        for, their taxes are less than those of either England or France. Very
        few foreigners are travelling <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> in
        Germany, although conditions of</p>

      <p>I look forward to this issue of letters from my Campbell cousins, and
        hope that I may see some of you in Elmira this summer if not before then
        in Wellesley Hills.</p>
