            <p class="SecndP">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I685">Ed
                Hazlett</a>'s absentmindedness was a by-word. Cowanesque Valley
              People had many chuckles over it. There was a whole series of
              anecdotes about Ed's adventures with his new fangled horseless
              carriage.</p>
            <p class="SecndP">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first he had trouble
              remembering that he wasn't driving a horse. Once he hollered
              "Whoa", &amp; expecting it to stop got out. The car went right on,
              of course. He had to run after it.</p>
            <p class="SecndP">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A favorite story was
              about Ed taking his <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I686">wife</a>
              to Corning shopping. On his way home to Tompkins (downstream from
              Nelson), he stopped to visit with a neighboring farmer. "How's
              your wife, Ed?" he was asked. </p>
            <p class="SecndP">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed looked in surprise at
              her empty seat, "My God." he shouted. "I've left her in Corning.</p>
            <p class="SecndP">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed was head of the local
              political machine.<sup>1</sup> He'd arranged for a VIP to come to
              speak at an important meeting. Ed &amp; the boys were at the
              Station to meet the dignitary's train. Naturally he got into Ed's
              car. There was so much to discuss that Ed paid (even) less
              attention to driving than usual. It was so hair-raising that the
              Politico jumped out yelling, "I'll walk!" Then added, "I value my
              life".</p>
            <p class="SecndP">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1256">Tom</a><sup>2</sup>
              said, "Don't get the wrong idea about Ed. He was intelligent, a
              good businessman, a shrewd politician &amp; very articulate. The
              natives commented "Ed was quite a talker".</p>
            <p class="SecndP">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the clan were
              "talkers". After G. Grandfather <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I978">H.D.
                Goodrich</a>'s daughter, <a href="GoodrichFrances1871.html">Frank</a>
              married <a href="HoytJosephD1860.html">Joe Hoyt</a>, he was
              invited to the Campbell Gatherings. "I'd always supposed the Scots
              were silent people, but I've never heard anything like the
              Campbells when they get together", he remarked. </p>
            <p class="SecndP">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom commented on the
              noise level at the Campbell Cousin Reunions.<sup>3</sup> They
              weren't noisy or raucous, there was just a lot of talking going
              on.</p>
            <p class="SecndP">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1591">Ed
                Hills</a>, old Ed Hazlett's great great nephew.<sup>4.</sup> He
              remembered the story about the Corning trip &amp; added some more
              details. The Clan descendants have long memories.</p>
            <p>As told by <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1250">mother</a>.</p>

      <p>1. He was chairman of the Tioga County Republican Committee.</p>
      <p>2. Anne's older brother.</p>
      <p>3. Tom would have been talking about the Campbell Reunions of the
        1930s.</p>
      <p>4. I think Anne was ill when she wrote this, which may account for her
        error. Ed Hills was not related to Ed Hazlett. She probably meant to
        write "<a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I666">Jack
          Hazlett</a>." Jack was Ed Hills' brother-in-law and was a nephew of Ed
        Hazlett.</p>
