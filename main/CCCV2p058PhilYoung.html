      <p>Dear Campbell Cousins:</p>

      <p>The event since my last letter at 437 Maple Avenue is a <a href="http://www.radiolaguy.com/Showcase/Radiola/AeriolaSr.htm">Radiola</a>.
        We have had it just two weeks today. Last night we attended the
        Pittsburg [sic] church service from beginning to end, starting with the
        organ voluntary and a couple of old hymns and selections by the choir.
        There were also two solos, one "The Psalms," and the other Granier's
        "Hosanna." I have sung these numbers at least once a year for twenty
        years while I was in the choir, and it surely was a treat for me. The
        sermon by Rev. Percival H. Parker. and the text "The Kingdom of God is
        Within You," was a masterly effort. This lasted forty-five (45) minutes
        which is just twice too long. I feel like writing Parker that he should
        have better terminal facilities.</p>

        is preaching at Rockville Centre, Long Island and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1537">Edward</a>
        is teaching music in New York City and plays an organ at a church in
        Yonkers. I could not help thinking that perhaps sometime they may be
        together and furnish their Dad with church services which he can listen
        to through the Radio.</p>
      <p>Saturday night we had the Roes<sup>1</sup> down for dinner and to stay
        all night so that <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1502">Jay</a>
        could get all the Radio he needed. We turned on the dinner concert at
        6:15 o'clock and had a continuous performance until twelve o'clock and
        could have had more. The dinner concerts are always very good, but last
        only forty-five (45) minutes. The outstanding feature Saturday night was
        the Mozart Quartet of Holyoke, Mass. They sang in Springfield Saturday
        night and it was one of the most charming quartets I have ever heard
        outside of Grand Opera. All of this performance was just as plain, and
        some a little louder than if we had been in the Church in Pittsburg, or
        in the room where the performance was given, We have located twenty-five
        or thirty stations and by looking at the New York Paper each day we pick
        out the performance want to hear, either in Boston, Chicago, Pittsburg
        or Springfield. We set the machine on this station, take an easy chair
        and listen. I do not know why we did not have one before<sup>2</sup>.</p>

      <p>2. AM radio has certainly changed a lot since then. Obviously the
        programming has changed dramatically. (BTW, in the early days of FM
        radio, that programming was mostly classical music too.) Note also the
        distance of the stations he was listening too. In the early days of
        "commercial" radio (it wasn't very commercial back then), there were
        only a few stations, many built and owned by Westinghouse or GE, and
        because interference with local stations was not a problem then, they
        broadcast much stronger signals than is allowed these days. Daytime
        reception of far away stations was poor, but at night, if there were no
        thunderstorms or sun spots, reception from Chicago or Boston was great.
        It's noteworthy that the <span style="font-style: italic;">New York
          Times</span> (or perhaps the <span style="font-style: italic;">Herald
          Tribune</span>) carried listings for all those stations' programming.</p>

      <p>The last six months have been rather uneventful. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1497">Ida</a>
        and I had a beautiful trip to Miami, Florida, leaving the month of
        February to our friends in the North. It certainly was grand to get up
        in the morning at about daylight and listen to the birds sing, then take
        out the old golf bag and go down for breakfast looking at the flowers
        blooming along the way, -- then out to the golf course between eight and
        nine o'clock. I got back in town between twelve and one o'clock for
        lunch, or else had lunch at the Country Club, then hiked to the beach
        for a swim and came back for dinner and spent the evening sitting in the
        park under the coconut palms listening to Pryor's band, -- turned in
        about nine o'clock good and tired but feeling fine.</p>
      <p>It rained just one night while we were there, but it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rained</span>.
        The streets looked like rivers, so that night we went to the theater and
        saw "Irene". I went deep sea fishing one day in a small motor boat and
        saw many varieties of wonderful fish. The water was so very clear we
        could see down about fifty feet. I caught one fish, a grouper, weighing
        seven pounds. I would much rather fish in Lake Keuka with my wife in one
        end of the boat and a pail of minnows between us.</p>
      <p> In closing I can only say that things are well with us, last year
        being my largest business year<sup>3</sup>, and I played a good deal at
        that.</p>
