    <div class="Salutation">
      <p>My dear Aunts, Uncles and Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> The time has slipped by so quickly I can not believe my letter is
        behind the schedule. I suppose "busy" is a poor excuse. However, with
        over fifty people in the house, and all wanting some little attention,
        and in serving breakfast to about one hundred twenty-five people, we
        manage to keep busy. </p>
      <p> We serve no noon luncheon except to the family which consists of <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1681">Ford
          Pratt</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1682">wife</a>
        and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1690">son</a>
        besides ourselves. At five thirty P.M. we begin serving dinner which
        lasts until seven o'clock. </p>
      <p> Ford came here early in February with his family, and expects to make
        St. Petersburg his permanent home. He, with <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1693">Curt</a>
        and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1704">Merritt
          Mitchell</a>, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1704">Ruth</a>'s
        husband, has just built and started an open air motion picture theater
        for the colored people<sup>1</sup>. Ford has bought a piece of land on
        which he expects to build a number of small houses for sale and rent.
        These houses find a very ready market. </p>
      <p> Ford's daughter, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1685">Martha</a>,
        recently of Elmira College, has entered Stetson University at Deland.
        Out son, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1688">Tom</a>,
        is at University of Florida in Gainesville. Contrary to the general
        opinion, we have very good schools in Florida. In fact, I believe they
        are equal to any of the northern colleges.</p>
      <p>We have had a wonderful winter with the weather perfect. It doesn't
        seem possible that there has been snow banks and ice anywhere, or that
        any one has had to shovel coal, ashes and snow.</p>
      <p>Wouldn't it be fine to hold a cousins reunion in St. Petersburg? Now
        that <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Aunt Kate</a> and Uncle <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I787">Lish
          Horton</a> have a home here, Ruth and Merritt, my <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">mother</a>
        and <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">father</a>, the Pratts and
        ourselves are all housed, we could take care of you all. One day we
        called together twenty-six relatives for a picnic and swim at the beach
        on the Gulf of Mexico. What town up North could call a crowd of that
        number together upon an hour's notice?</p>

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>1. 1925 was within the heyday of "Jim Crow" laws in the South, so movie
        audiences had to be segregated. And, as Cousin Eva HOOKER Hills letter
        on pg, 5 illustrates, the KKK was alive and well in Pennsylvania (and
        Middle Atlantic states) then.</p>
