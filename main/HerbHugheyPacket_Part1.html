        each of these packets had a cover letter individually addressed to its
        recipient. I referred to them as a "packet" because this letter, Herb's
        obit, Will's letter to Herb, Herb's reply, and Will list of cousins were

      <p> Personally, I do not ever recall having seen Cousin Herb as he went
        West in 1879 and had never returned East even for a short visit. In
        fact, I have never had occasion to write Herb on any matter but last
        December when sending out copies of our little book of photographs <span
          class="Annotation">[several of us have copies. I'll scan mine and
          place a link to it here-wbt]</span> to the various first Cousins , I
        mailed a set to Cousin Herbert at the same time writing a nice long
        letter. In my letter, I requested that if possible he favor me with a
        copy of his photograph as I had not the slightest idea how he looked.
        Within a few days, I received from him a photograph of himself and also
        of his wife, both of which I prize most highly. There was considerable
        delay in answering my letter but I did receive a very nice letter from
        him, and inasmuch as his letter contains so much valuable history of
        himself and family, and inasmuch as he has passed away, I thought each
        of the remaining first Cousins should have a copy of his letter to me,
        which letter by the way may have been the last one he wrote to any of
        the first Cousins.</p>
      <p> You have undoubtedly received from Cousin Em Buck a copy of the
        Watkins paper containing the complete announcement of his death but in
        case you have not, I am sending along a copy of this report and would
        suggest that they be put away for safekeeping and to be referred to in
        years to come by others in your family.</p>
      <p> I might say that Herb's letter of February 15th was one of the nicest
        and sweetest letters in many respects than I have ever received. You
        will note that in many places the letter is filled with the finest of
        sentiments and ideals. It is to be regretted that in some way he and his
        wife could not have made a visit East to one of the Cousins Dinners and
        renewed his acquaintance with his own kind before having gone on. There
        must have been a great deal of satisfaction in his heart in his last
        days because of the knowledge that he had lived a correct life in every
        way and was the father of two fine boys and two fine girls who I am sure
        will prove a lasting monument to his memory.</p>
      <p> Please pardon my writing you in this personal way but as Herb's letter
        was so nice and contained so much information which most of us did not
        know, I thought you would appreciate my passing it on to you.</p>
      <p> With kind regards and best wishes and hoping to see you before many
        months, I am</p>
