        the twenty-first annual reunion.</p>

          Mrs. Will Monroe</a> proved her loyalty to the Clan by giving a talk
        in which she urged all members to be present at each and every Reunion.
        We wish the absent members might have heard it. Letters were read from a
        number of absent friends.</p>
      <p>About one-hundred were present. The meeting was adjourned earlier than
