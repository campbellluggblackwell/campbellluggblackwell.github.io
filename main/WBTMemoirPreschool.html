            <p>I was born in the middle of the Great Depression, in Binghamton
              General Hospital, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binghamton,_New_York">
                Binghamton, NY</a>. Which, according to journalists, makes me
              part of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Generation">The
                Silent Generation</a>,” a term which I have always disliked and
              felt was a misnomer.</p>
            <p>My parents were "citified", but grew up on farms. They were part
              of the “Late Victorian Period” (if you consider the era's
              architecture and furniture) or what&nbsp; some US historians see
              as the "Progressive Era" (1890 - 1920). My father, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-1681">Walter
                Frederick Thompson, Sr.</a> was born in 1893. And my mother, <a

                href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hoyt-211">Jessica Phoebe
                HOYT</a> Thompson (according to her) or Phoebe Jessica HOYT
              Thompson (according to him -- they had a running, for fun,
              squabble about it) was born in 1892. He addressed her sometimes as
              ‘Jess’ and sometimes as “Phebe.’ I was a mid-life surprise. I
              joined them and my three siblings at their home at 8 Bayless Ave.,
              where I lived for my first year in Binghamton’s 5th ward, near
              Ross Park. My siblings, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47215">Walter
                Jr.</a>, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47216">Anne
                Elizabeth</a> and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47217">Henry
                G.</a> were enough older that they often seemed more like uncles
              and aunt, than brothers and sisters. Walter, Jr. (nicknamed ‘Tom’
              even before he was born) was almost 18 and had already graduated
              from HS and was working; Anne Elizabeth was 16; and Henry G.
              (originally ‘Gray’ for unknown reasons, but he later had it
              legally changed to ‘Goodrich’) was almost 13.</p>

            <p>My 2nd year was spent just east of Binghamton, on Conklin Rd., NY
              Route 7, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conklin,_New_York">Town
                of Conklin</a>. One story that I was told many times, but don’t
              consciously remember, was of a day when my siblings took me for a
              canoe ride on the Susquehanna River that ran behind the house, got
              fooling around and tipped over. They had visions of my drowning,
              but were relieved to see me (according to Anne) “happily dog
              paddling.” But I wonder if subconscious memories account for why
              to this day I like being ON the water, but not IN it.</p>

            <p>I have no conscious memories of living in either place, but do
              remember our 3rd home, 14 Columbia Ave., Binghamton, a return to
              its 5th ward. I was almost three. Next door was a candy maker who
              had turned his whole basement into a candy production line that
              changed with the season, sometimes taffy, sometimes hard candies,
              and for Christmas season, candy canes and best of all, ribbon
              candy. Plus they had a 4 year old granddaughter who liked to play
              “doctor” and contributed to my early education. </p>
            <p> Looking back, I think the reason we moved so often was because
              during the depression, my father, a skilled tool and die maker,
              was out of work much of the time or underemployed such as working
              on a loading dock, so they probably had trouble paying the rent --
              altho my mother was working as an elementary school teacher. I had
              no idea what a “depression” was or that the family was struggling
              financially. Tom was working full time, but his job in the mail
              room of an insurance company only paid $10/week. I never went
              hungry, but remember many nights when supper was a bowl of potato
              soup and a square of fresh baked cornbread. Or fried cornmeal mush
              with maple syrup. Or, occasionally, milk toast. I suspect some of
              my bones developed slightly misshapen because of not getting
              enough milk.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;But they were good years. I have many happy memories of
              Columbia Ave. Running out to greet my father when he came home and
              hugging his knees so tightly that he couldn’t walk (which he
              didn’t care much for); or gathering pocket fulls of shiny horse
              chestnuts; and Tom putting me in one of his Adirondak pack baskets
              and taking me with him on his hikes -- often taking along a .22
              rifle he’d carved a stock for, and "plinking" (often successfully)
              at squirrels. (Fried squirrel is quite tasty.); of the first
              friend I remember, Johnny Tinklepaugh (whose name I found
              fascinating). And many other memories. The iceman delivering big
              blocks of ice he carried via large tongs. A hawker with a heavy
              Italian accent, who came down our street each day in season with
              his horse drawn wagon selling fresh produce and calling out what
              he had that day. He hadn’t grown it all himself, because I
              remember him selling bananas. One day a photographer and his pony
              came down the street and my mother paid his fee to take my photo,
              in cowboy attire, on the pony.<img src="Bill_on_pony.jpg" alt="Photo of Bill in cowboy outfit on pony"

                style="width:20%;"> And of course there was a milkman and the
              wintertime miracle of how the bottles of cream would partially
              freeze and push up their paper caps on a white, frozen column.<img

                src="PhotoFrozenMilkBottle.png" alt="Photo of frozen milk bottle"

                style="width:15%; float:center;"> And let's not forget Fuller
              Brush salesmen with their amazing, can do anything, line of
              products. Their brushes were very good. And, I also remember Tom
              building a kayak in the basement from a kit, then discovering he
              couldn't make the turn needed to get it out of the cellar door and
              having to remove the canvas and partially disassemble the frame to
              get it out. I also have vivid memories of a Pyrex percolator that
              was <img src="PyrexPercolator.png" alt="Phoro of pyrex percolator"

                style="width:20%; float: right;">on the gas range making coffee,
              but broke when I was near the stove, spilling boiling water on me
              that raised blisters that reminded me of half potatoes.This is
              where we lived when Hank got polio, and had to spend a very hot,
              pre-airconditioning summer in a body cast because of scoliosis. He
              got very creative as to what he could use for back scratchers.
              Yardsticks, coat hangers, most anything that was thin enough to
              insert under the cast was fair game. </p>
            <p>Writing about Hank's polio reminds me about doctors' house calls.
              In those days, if you were sick, the family doctor came to see
              you. Accompanied of course by his (almost all doctors were male)
              omnipresent "little black bag. It didn't contain much -- a
              stethoscope, thermometer, stopwatch. tongue depressors, several
              large bottles of pills, a few ointments and tonics, bandage
              materials, and probably supplies and equipment for stitches. The
              pills were only for routine stuff: diarrhea, nausea, constipation,
              fever, pain and that was about it. Sulfa drugs and antibiotics
              hadn't been invented yet.</p>
            <p>Most employers didn't offer health insurance -- that came in the
              WW2 days of labor shortage. Paying doctors was rather informal.
              During the Depression, my parents, like most people, often didn't
              have any money to pay the doctor. Our family doctor, Martin Weis,
              (who delivered me) was an angel. When my parents, embarrassed,
              would say "We can't pay you today," he would reply "Don't worry
              about it, I know you'll pay me when you can." Country doctors
              often were paid with a bushel of potatoes or a couple of chickens.
            </p>
            <p>At this house (and subsequent ones when I was a kid), a big event
              was coal deliveries.&nbsp; They would back a dump truck up to the
              house's cellar window to the coal bin, extend shiny, steel chutes
              into the opened window, and the coal would slide down with a
              glorious roar. Toward the end of the delivery, which usually
              involved increasing the angle of the cargo portion of the truck,
              one or two workers would get in the compartment to shovel the last
              of the load down the chutes. The pets would hide. It's excitement
              broke up the daily monotony.</p>
            <p>I would be remiss, if I neglected to tell you this about living
              in that house. Frequently, men (some of them hobos), would come to
              the door asking to do chores in exchange for food. Dad was pretty
              handy with tools, and with two teen age sons, we seldom needed
              their assistance, but out of respect for their sense of dignity
              mom would often accept a chore in exchange for a meal. Sometimes
              we didn't have enough food for that, but she would never send them
              away with nothing. She'd at least give them an apple or a peanut
              butter sandwich, even without a chore.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Next we moved back to Conklin Rd. a mile or two east of where
              we’d lived before. It was farther from the river, but Tom built a
              conveyance, consisting of a pair of bicycle wheels on an axle,
              such that the width of the canoe would fit between the wheels, and
              a strap would secure it, that enabled you to easily tow the canoe
              down to the river -- which wasn’t as close as the earlier house
              had been. Between the house and the river were waterholes --
              depressions several feet deep where spring flood water was trapped
              and you could fish for bullheads. I had pretty good luck and
              learned, the hard way, how to remove them from the hook without
              getting “stung.” Employment was picking up as US factories turned
              out <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/lend-lease-act">Lend
                Lease</a> weapons and equipment for Britain. So I don’t think
              that moving this time was because paying the rent was the problem,
              I think it was for more room. By this time, my mother’s mother, <a

                href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Goodrich-6301">Frances Viola
                GOODRICH</a> Hoyt, had joined us, replacing the housekeepers my
              mother had previously employed when possible. She needed a home.
              She’d been living with her youngest daughter, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hoyt-3419">Isabelle
                HOYT</a> Field in Elmira, who suddenly died of meningitis.
              Apparently a mother-in-law was no longer welcome, and gram had to
              find another home and she stayed with us for the rest of her life.
            </p>
            <p>One story about her I want to be sure to tell you relates to
              cigarettes. Gram babysat me while my mother taught school. Like
              most folks those days, gram smoked, which I thought was pretty
              cool. So one day when she lit up after lunch, I asked if I could
              try one. So she removed one from the pack, lit it and handed it to
              me. Followed by a second when I asked. I was on my third when I
              suddenly “turned green,” began barfing, and was as sick as a dog
              for the rest of the afternoon. Mom was furious when she got home,
              but I never wanted another cigarette. </p>
            <p>An incident happened then that I will never forget. I had a
              cocker spaniel puppy, my first dog. One day when we were playing
              in the side yard, the puppy ran out into the side road and was run
              over by a passing neighbor’s truck. The neighbor felt terrible
              about it, but he had no chance of stopping when the dog darted out
              in the street so suddenly. But being run over caused the dog’s
              eyes to pop out or his head -- a sight that haunted my nightmares
              for years. </p>
            <p>The kitchen door that I entered that day intrigued me. It was a
              Dutch door and the top half was always open in the summer -- air
              conditioning was still in the future. I couldn’t see out over it,
              and one of my ambitions was to grow enough to look out over it,
              but I think we moved before that was accomplished. </p>
            <p>We might have had to move sooner than we did, thanks to my
              excavating the next door neighbor’s front yard. I had a perfectly
              justifiable reason. I saw a rainbow that ended in the middle of
              his front yard and wasted no time trying to discover the
              leprechaun’s treasure. Unfortunately, the neighbor came home
              before I succeeded and was very uninterested in letting me
              complete the task. Dad managed to mollify him and make amends. For
              months I itched to complete the task, but knew I’d be in big
              trouble if I tried. </p>
            <p>I didn’t play in the front yard much -- Conklin Rd had heavy
              traffic. There was no sidewalk beside the road and no paved
              driveway, but there was a sidewalk from the rarely used front door
              to the road. It was maybe 30 feet long, so that sidewalk was where
              I flew/peddled my airplane and that made a perfect runway for me.
              It had t<em></em>he same chassis as a four wheeled, peddle it
              yourself, kids’ car, but with an airplane chassis and very short
              wings . I loved peddling that -- being careful not to get too
              close to Conklin’s main road. </p>
            <p>On the other side of that road was Lawrence Brothers’ large farm.
              Later on they had a dairy and ice cream shop. But back then they
              just had many acres on the Susquehanna flood plain’s rich soil and
              ample aquifer planted with a wide variety of vegetables that they
              shipped by the truck loads. And, out of sight, farther down the
              road - a produce stand. My strongest memories of that farm were in
              the spring, when they spread cow manure on the fields as
              fertilizer. I never minded the smell. It was just one of the
              “signs of spring.” </p>
            <p>My mother taught K through 3rd grade in one room. It wasn’t a 1
              room country school, it had two floors and 3 rooms. K - 3 had the
              entire first floor and the 2nd floor had a room for the combined
              4th and 5th grades, while the sixth graders had a room all their
              own -- taught by the principal. Having multiple grades in the same
              room worked out amazingly well -- more on that in the Education
              Chapter. </p>
            <p>Kindergarten wasn’t compulsory. Having your child as one of your
              pupils presents problems. My mother knew she’d be my first grade
              teacher, so I didn’t attend kindergarten. Just stayed home,
              played, and smoked cigarettes (but very briefly). :) </p>
            <p>I loved being read to and couldn’t wait to be able to read
              whatever book I wanted, whenever I wanted. However my mother was
              afraid that it would “spoil” first grade for me if I learned to
              read before getting there. So, she forbade my siblings from
              teaching me. But, as they read the newspaper comic strips to me, I
              talked them into pointing to each word as they read it aloud. I
              still had a lot to learn when I got to first grade, such as how to
              “sound out words,” but I was reading pretty well. (BTW, most
              people I encounter in the Allentown, PA area, don’t know how to
              sound out words. When people see my address, “Pericles Place” they
              have no idea how to pronounce it. Or spell it if they hear it, how
              to spell it. Which shows they either didn’t ever study Athenian
              history or if they did, didn’t pay attention. We studied it in
              Binghamton in my day. Moreover, many pharmacy staff and medical
              office personnel processing a list of what medications you take or
              how to pronounce medications they aren’t familiar with. It’s too
              bad they never were taught how to "sound out" words.) </p>
            <p>Watching my siblings read comic strips such as<i> Little Lulu</i>,
              <i>Dick Tracy</i>, <i>Popeye</i>, <i>Little Orphan Annie</i>, <i>The
                Phantom</i> and <i>The Katzenjammer Kids</i> to me, plus
              listening to anyone I could find read <i>Uncle Remus</i>, <i>Peter
                Rabbit</i>, <i>Winnie The Pooh</i>, and <i>Uncle Wiggily</i>
              to me, set the stage for our next chapter. Every Uncle Wiggily
              story ended with a teaser, written by the author's wife, such as </p>
            <blockquote> "Now next I’m going to tell you about the Kinkytails
              and the doll’s house—that is, if the alarm clock will stop making
              figures all over my paper so I can write the story, and if the
              coffee pot doesn’t step on the rolling pin’s toes."</blockquote>
            <p>So -- in that spirit, "Next I'm going to tell <b>you</b> what
              happened after I learned to read."</p>
