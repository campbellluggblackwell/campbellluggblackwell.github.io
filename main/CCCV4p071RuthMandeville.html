      <p>Dear Cousins:-</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> A hospital doesn't seem a very cheering place from which to send
        greetings - however, it is simply that the Mandeville's <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>
        have lost another pair of tonsils; <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1563">Billy</a>'s
        this time. He is getting along splendidly, particularly with the sign
        language. In a few days everyone will hear all the gory details. His
        mind seems to work that way. Sometime in the future, yellow journalism
        will have a first class reporter. When <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1560">Bill</a>
        and I returned from a trip recently, his first question was, "Did you
        see any nice accidents?" - on answering "No", he said, "Gee, didn't you
        even see a train wreck?" The trip apparently was a failure as far as he
        was concerned - but not for us. Bill had Grippe and a few days in
        Atlantic City did him worlds of good.<sup>1</sup></p>
      <p>Our interests haven't changed much since last year, centering in the
        boys of course. Billy is in the second grade and admits that he is one
        of the star pupils only the teacher doesn't know it. It happens that way
        sometimes.</p>
      <p> <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1564">David</a>
        is an angelic looking boy (if you don't look too long). Those who
        remember <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1565">Jerome</a>
        in his hectic infancy may have some idea of David. Suffice it to say,
        ours is not a quiet household.</p>
      <p>Bill is, as always, busy with business and public affairs. I think
        everyone knows that <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1551">Joe</a>
        and he are in the same law office.</p>
      <p>When I hear of how active Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I927">Anna
          Buck</a> is in her community, I feel how very useless I am in mine
        Some day I hope to do something worth mentioning.</p>
      <p>We are all very thankful that <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1549">Henry</a>,
        <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1545">Pearl</a>'s
        son, pulled through a very critical illness.</p>
      <p><a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1544">Mother</a>,
        aside from colds, has been well this winter. At present her house is
        torn up from top to bottom being redecorated. If she doesn't write you
        will know the cause.</p>
