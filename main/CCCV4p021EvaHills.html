      <p> <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1591">Ed</a>
        is in the Boston office every Wednesday<sup>1</sup> so on the two nights
        each week while he is away I try to accomplish some extra work such as
        letter writing (It's getting quite an effort with me.)<sup>2</sup> So
        tonight, March 17th, as I am listening to the good Irish music over the
        Radio I will commence my yearly contributions to the book in which I am
        very proud to have my signature.</p>
      <p>During the past year much has happened to us in the way of pleasure.
        Our vacation trip in July, 1925, included Albany and Troy, (where we
        stopped a night with Clare Baxter Smith).<sup>3</sup> For Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1478">Harry
          Campbell</a>'s benefit I want to say she is just as pretty as he
        remembers her in Nelson as a girl<sup>4</sup>. She has two daughters,
        one a perfect picture of herself<sup>5</sup>. </p>
      <p>Over the <a href="http://www.mohawktrail.com/driving-tours.html">Mohawk
          Trail</a> to Concord and Lexington where we stayed in the Mansion
        House of Revolutionary Fame. The reason we missed seeing Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I981">Emily
          Blanchard</a> was that I had understood she would be in Nelson at that
        time.</p>
      <p>In Boston we tried to see the most important things. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1592">Junior</a>
        wanted to see where Paul Revere hung the lanterns<sup>6</sup> so he and
        Ed climbed the stairs in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_North_Church">Old
          North Church</a>. I stayed on the ground and read tomb stones.<br>
      </p>
      <p>One night we visited friends in Swampscott near President Coolidge's
        summer home. I think I enjoyed the Vermont and New Hampshire scenery
        most of all. The trip along Lake Champlain was beautiful. We stopped at
        the Thousand Islands on our way home.</p>
      <p>During the summer Cousins <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommy</a>
        and <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">Frank Campbell</a>, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I773">Llewellyn</a>
        and <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel Shaw</a>, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I931">Billy</a>
        and <a href="BuckMyra1884.html">Myra Sieders</a> and children with
        Cousin <a href="CongdonEmma1848.html">Em Buck</a> visited us.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>1. Ed (who was a very nice man) was leather buyer for the
        Endicott-Johnson Shoe Co. In the 1920s Boston had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather_District">Leather
          District</a>, where many leather goods factories were located. So
        there presumably were leather sellers there that Ed may have purchased
        from - wbt.</p>
      <p>2. I'm not sure what the difficulty was. She was only 40 at the time.
        And from the time I knew her (from 1940 to her death), she was not
        infirm. I suspect she was finding herself busy as the mother of a 7 yr.
        old - wbt.</p>
      <p>3. Clarissa Madge Baxter, called "Clara" or "Claire", was born in 1883
        in Carbon Co., PA, but her father as from Nelson and Claire grew up in
        Nelson. She was a friend of my mother and the many photos I have of her
        prove that she was a beautiful young woman. When more photo albums are
        added to this website, I will try to remember to provide a link some of
        Claire's photos. Claire was a niece of <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I686">Eva
          BAXTER</a> Foster Hazlett and a granddaughter of the Hon. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I687">Geo.
          Baxter</a>, whose 1st wife was <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I93">Sarah
          Clarissa Campbell</a>.</p>
      <p>4.Eva is referring to Harry's mention of Clair in a <a href="CCCV3p087HarryCampbell.html">previous
          letter</a>.</p>
      <p>5. Does anyone know which of Claire's daughters Eva was referring to?</p>
      <p>6. Almost everyone then had read Henry W. Longfellow's poem, <span style="font-style: italic;">The
          Midnight Ride of Paul Revere</span>. and remembered bits and pieces
        of, such as the lantern signal, "one if by land and two if by
        sea."&nbsp; But the next line was "And I on the opposite shore will be."
        In Longfellow's version of history, the lantern(s) were supposed to be
        hung as signals <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for</span>
        Paul Revere waiting across the Charles River in Cambridge, not signals <span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">from</span> him. If interested,
        you can read <a href="http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/paul-reveres-ride.html">a
          more accurate account of the ride</a>.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;Just Christmas I drove to New York with Ed on business. We did a
        little Christmas shopping and took in a show. Next to <a href="http://www.ovrtur.com/production/2879949">Blossom
          Time</a> I think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Miller">Marilyn
          Miller</a> in "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny_%28musical%29">Sunny</a>"
        the best musical I've seen. Returning we had a short time with Cousins <a
          href="BuckGeorge1877.html">George</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I927">Anna
          Buck</a> at Madison, New Jersey, found Cousin Em there and just missed
        Cousins <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> and <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Ann
          Owlett</a>, who were driving over that afternoon.</p>
      <p>We had a very nice visit with <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1276">Betty</a>
        and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1277">Roy
          Walker</a> in North Brookfield one night on a trip to Utica last fall.
      </p>
      <p>Christmas we spent with <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1595">Treva</a>
        and <a href="LoopStella1863.html">Mama</a>. I suppose Treva and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I666">Jack</a>
        are enjoying themselves in Florida, We do hope Jack's health is better
        when he returns.</p>
      <p>Junior and I spent two weeks in Nelson in August and enjoyed the
        Campbell Reunion again. Mama is expecting us Easter so I hope the roads
        will be opened up<sup>7</sup> after the long snowy winter we've had.</p>
      <p>Johnson City had an epidemic of "Flu" in February but it is nearly over
        now. Aside from that, we've all been very well and enjoyed ourselves.</p>
      <p>Heard so many good things over the Radio during the winter that we have
        always been well entertained.</p>
      <p>During the coming summer we hope to see more of the relatives stopping
        on their way thru town.</p>

      <p>7. It was difficult to drive the cars of the day on dirt roads (which
        almost all were) if either: a) they were icy; or b) a quagmire from
        spring rains. Driving cars had to be kept to a minimum until the Spring
        rains ended and the mud dried --- and the deep ruts could be filled in
        and the high spots scraped down --- thus "opening the roads." .</p>
