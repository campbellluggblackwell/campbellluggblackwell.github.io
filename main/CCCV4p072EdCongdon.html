        Dear Cousins All:-
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        I have just been looking over volume three of Campbell Cousins
        Correspondence Book, and was especially interested in Cousin <span wc_id="I1551">
        Joe Buck</span>'s <a href="CCCV3p072JosWBuck.html">
        letter</a>, going way back to 1810, when the Campbells sailed for
        America<sup>1</sup>, giving an account of their trip and their
        privations in establishing their homes in the new country. I cam
        remember hearing Aunt <a href="CampbellEleanor1828.html">Eleanor
        Bosard</a> tell some thrilling stories of their history when they were
        children; then, the country was nearly all woods; or their encounter
        with wild beasts, and the hardships that they had to meet; settling in
        the beautiful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowanesque_River">Cowanesque Valley</a>
        at <a href="BeechersIsland.html">
        Beechers Island</a>, now called Nelson. They lived their lives and
        raised large families, and are now sleeping in the old burying
        ground<sup>2</sup>. They are our Scotch forefathers. Their generation
        lived their lives, and passed on, leaving us a heritage of which we are
        proud.
      </p>
<p>
        We are now living in a different age. In our forefathers' day when men
        reached the point that they were worth ten thousand dollars they were
        rich. They had none of the luxuries of today, and but very few of the
        conveniences. Is the world advancing? We have only to to glance to our
        father's day and compare the changes. First, the machinery to save
        labor and all the wonderful improvements. How would we get along
        without electricity, radios, autos, etc.? We are living in the world's
        greatest age. The churches and religion are greatly advanced. No, I
        don't think we would be happy to go back to those old days. I am
        satisfied that the world is growing better every day. I am trying to
        see the bright side of life.
      </p>
<p>
        The past year has been rather uneventful. Since we came from the East
        and Florida we have had weather very much like Florida, - a beautiful
        summer, and the fall and winter have been grand, - no snow, not much
        rain, but just fine weather. I would go to Florida, as the winter that
        we spent there was ideal.
      </p>
<p>
<a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a> and <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">Frank</a> knew what they were doing when they
        chose Florida. Since returning from our Eastern trip last June, we have
        been living in an apartment house, #1205 North Yakima Avenue, Tacoma,
        Washington, having rented our house in South Tacoma. We expect to move
        on 24th Street North, in about a month. We will be glad then to receive
        any of the dear Cousins that gave us such a warm reception when we were
        with them.

<div class="Footnote">
<p>
        1. <a href="CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph Campbell</a>, his wife
        <a href="HarperMary1749.html">Mary Harper</a>, and their youngest
        children, probably including <a href="CampbellJane1792.html">Jane</a>,
        <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph</a> and <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James</a> came together in 1810. Their older
        children came earlier, settling in Lancaster Co., PA, where the eldest
        grandchild, <span wc_id="I38">
        Archibald Hazlett</span>, was born in 1803. And the elder Joseph's
        brother, <a href="CampbellJohn1761.html">John</a>, may have settled in
        Philadelphia as early as 1776.
      </p>
<p>
        2. The earliest of our pioneer ancestors were buried in a family burial
        ground on what had originally been Daniel Strait's property, which was
        <a href="HazlettSamuel1780.html">Sam Hazlett</a>'s initial Tioga Co.
        property; later passed on to his brother <a href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John</a> (and wife Jane Campbell); then John
        and Jane's daughter <span wc_id="I78">
        Eliza HAZLETT</span> Merritt got it; and the farm stayed in the Merritt
        family for generations until sold to a Mr. Paul Bennett. <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Jane CAMPBELL</a> Tubbs gave a scathing report
        to a Campbell Reunion about its lack of care and some problems were
        corrected. But as part of the Cowanesque Lake Project, these old family
        plots were dug up, and remains and the surviving tombstones moved to
        the NW corner of the Nelson Cem. But because most of those tombstone
        pieces were laid flat, grass tends to grow over them, hiding their
        presence.

        Dear Cousin <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Kate Horton</a> made us a
        short visit in March, and we enjoyed it so much, - could not bear to
        see her go. She was so nice to us when we were in Florida. Both she and
        <span wc_id="I787">
        Lish</span> came to Oregon when <span wc_id="I815">
        Nellie</span> had her operation, but Lish did not come to see us. He
        thought the trip too far for him.
      </p>
<p>
        We understand Nellie is getting along nicely. We hope to go down there
        this summer and visit them.
      </p>
<p>
        Since returning home we have spent much time with <span wc_id="I941">
        Georgie</span> and <span wc_id="I942">
        Oscar</span> on their flower farm. It is beautiful over there. Oscar quit
        the office<sup>3</sup> and is working home with Georgie. <span wc_id="I947">
        Lee</span> has changed partners and is working hard in the real estate
        business. <span wc_id="I951">
        Elizabeth</span> is in high school. <span wc_id="I949">
        Edgar</span> is studying music, and is working for Sherman &amp; Clay's, a
        large music house. <span wc_id="I948">
        Helen</span> has a studio  and forty five scholars. So all are
        working hard.
      </p>
<p>
        Em and I will spend part of the summer with Georgie and part of the
        time in Tacoma. We must be doing something. Now if the Cousins will
        tell us how the world has used them in the past year and what they are
        all doing, it will draw us all nearer together.
      </p>
<p>
        I want to speak of that <a href="CCCV4p048b.html">wonderful photo</a>
        taken at the last Cousins' Dinner, at Cousin <a href="TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie Clark</a>'s. I think it is a wonderful
        photo. Fourteen Cousins, and their faces taken so clear that is seems
        they can speak to me. and we are indebted to Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> for them. I appreciate them more
        than I can tell. Would like very much to be with you all to attend the
        Cousins Dinner in 1927. We hear from sister <a href="CongdonEmma1848.html">Em</a> often. Brother <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie</a>'s family is scattered. <span wc_id="I966">
        Lousie</span> is still in Southern Pines, North Carolina. <span wc_id="I962">
        Bernice</span> is married and lives in Prescott, Arizona, - <span wc_id="I961">
        her mother</span> is with her. Brother Charlie is in New York City.
      </p>
<p>
        With love to all the dear Cousins,
      </p>
