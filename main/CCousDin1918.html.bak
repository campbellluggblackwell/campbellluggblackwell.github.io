      <p>1. "Our most gracious ... hostess" was a sister of the secretary's
        husband.</p>
      <p>2. Sister of the secretary elect.</p>
      <p>3. Emma lived in Schuyler Co., NY, but she's been visiting her
        daughter, who was living in Quakertown at the time.</p>
      <p>4. Pearl wasn't Kate's niece; Pearl was the daughter of Kate's 1st
        cousin, Grace CAMPBELL Mowrey Buck Carey.</p>
      <p>5. Fordyce "Ford" Owlett wasn't Kate's nephew; he was a son of Kate's
        1st cousin, Anna BOSARD Owlett.</p>
      <p>6. Nor was Effie SEYMORE Horton (1854 - 1920) a niece. She was the wife
        of John Colvin Horton (1843 - 1924), who also attended, and was a
        brother of the host.</p>
      <p>7. Outside of cities, paved roads were almost non-existent. And cars
        were rare. So almost all travel except for what a horse could cover in
        an hour or two was by train. Trains were almost everywhere. They could
        exceed 40 mph, but made so many stops that most probably averaged no
        more than 25 mph. (But better than a 1 horsepower buggy could do.)</p>
      <p>8. Presumably Williamsport lawyer, Clarence Loomis Peaslee (1871 -
        1935), who probably was&nbsp; somehow related to Kate's mother, Helen
        PEASLEY Campbell (1826- 1876).</p>
