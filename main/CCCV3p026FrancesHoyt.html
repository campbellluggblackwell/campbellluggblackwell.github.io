        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        March, that month so much dreaded by many of us, is nearly over, and
        what a wonderful month it has been - so much sunshine and so little
        shadow for blustery old March! The leaves here are so green, the robins
        so numerous and such large fellows, that for the last few weeks I have
        forgotten to envy my many friends who are spending the winter in the
        South.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early in December I was called to Osceola by the serious illness of my
        <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I979">
        mother</a>, and I am still here, although Mother is much improved in
        health, and I hope to go home for <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1285">
        Isabelle</a>'s Easter vacation. We are planning to spend most of that
        time in Binghamton with <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1250">
        Jess</a> and family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cousin <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I660">
        Mary Seely</a> and <a href="TubbsAnn1855.html">Anne Van Dusen</a> have
        been my near neighbors since I have been at <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I978">
        Father</a>'s, and I have enjoyed them both, and feel that their
        friendship has meant a great deal to me during this somewhat strenuous
        winter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am expecting to spend Wednesday of this week with Cousin <a href=
        "LoopStella1863.html">Stella Wilbur</a> at Nelson. I have not seen her
        since the Cousins Dinner at Mansfield, but as I have five grandchildren
        and she only three, I expect to do most of the talking myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        My family are all well and happy, but I suppose each of my daughters is
        a member of this club, I will not say much about them for fear of
        "stealing their thunder". It is rather hard not to write about the
        babies, as a grandmother can see so many things that a mere mother
        never notices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hoping that each and every one of the cousins is in the best of health
        and enjoying his or her share of this world's good things, I remain
