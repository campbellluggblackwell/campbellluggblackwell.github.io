      <p><a href="HoytInez1871.html">Inez Hoyt</a> was born Oct. 12, 1871, in
        Nelson, Tioga Co., PA; d. there Sep. 25, 1934. Married Aug. 19, 1896 in
        Nelson to <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Boller-100">William
          Boller</a>, b. Jun. 29, 1867, in Wyoming Co., NY; d. Feb. 10, 1949 in
        Nelson. William's parents were <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Boller-1037">Rudolph
          Louis Boller</a>, born 1824 in Germany, and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Ernest-192">Katrine
          Ernest</a>, born 1832 in Germany.</p>
      <p>Inez was the younger of 2 children of <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">Phebe
          Campbell</a>, b. 1832 in Nelson, Tioga Co., PA, d. there in 1917; and
        <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hoyt-3416">William Hoyt</a>, born
        1842 in CT, died 1888 in Nelson.<br>
      </p>
      <p>William and Inez Hoyt Boller had two children: </p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Boller-101">unnamed Boller</a>,
          born and died Dec. 25, 1900 in Nelson; and</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Boller-102">William Hoyt
            Boller</a>, called "Hoyt", b. Apr. 8, 1907 in Nelson, d. there Jan.
          10, 1908.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>William and Inez Hoyt Boller's farm, abt. 96 acres, bordered NYS.
        Strait Creek ran through it, on its way to the Cowanesque River. The
        farm had a couple of small "flats" along the creek, but most of it was
        hillside. The working part of the farm was primarily on the west side of
        the creek. Much of the east side of the creek was a slope covered with
        hemlocks, with lady slippers and a wide variety of forest wild flowers.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <blockquote><i>[When I stayed there in the 1940s on holidays or summer
          vacations, some of the flats were used for a plot of garden vegetables
          and the rest for a potato crop. The hillsides were used for raising
          hay for the Percheron horses that worked the farm and for pasture for
          the sheep that Billy Boller raised for wool and for sale.<br>
          <br>
          In Inez' day, it was very attractive and called "Rose Lawn Farm". When
          I knew it, the roses had been neglected for years, and the house
          unpainted as long. The plumbing was a well in the yard near the
          kitchen door and a small outhouse around the back. The latter was
          equipped with an old Sears catalog for double duty. Reading the
          interesting pages "during", and selecting uninteresting pages to tear
          out for "after". Lighting was by kerosene lamps. The heating was by a
          pot bellied coal stove in the kitchen. There was also a two burner
          kerosene counter top stove for cooking. The nearest telephone was at
          the neighboring farm of Inez's 2nd cousin twice removed, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-681">George
            G. Hazlett</a> (grandfather of Bruce Rupar, Judy HAZLETT Abel &amp;
          Linda HAZLETT Gardner).<br>
          <br>
          In the 1940, most people in Nelson and Farmington Townships had party
          lines. It was before dial phones --- phones had separate pieces for
          speaking and listening. The central exchange was a small plug board in
          the home of Campbell Cousin <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Owlett-57">John</a>
          and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Mattison-417">Eva Mattison</a>
          Owlett, near the train station. Eva was the switchboard operator. As a
          boy, it was fascinating to watch her answer incoming calls and plug a
          wire to connect the caller to the person they were calling.<br>
          <br>
          It may sound primitive to those who've grown up with dial phones,
          private lines, and unaccustomed to dealing with operators, but it had
          advantages. My mother (<a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hoyt-211">Jessica
            HOYT</a> Thompson) could call Billy Boller even though he had no
          phone. When she wanted to speak to him, she would place a
          person-to-person call via the Binghamton, NY operator. You would hear
          a couple of rings before the Elmira, NY, operator answered. Then the
          Binghamton operator would say "Elmira, this is Binghamton, I have a
          person-to-person call for William Boller in Nelson, Pa." Then a couple
          of rings and Eva MATTISON Owlett would answer in her distinctive,
          somewhat nasal voice. The Elmira operator would say "Nelson, this is
          Elmira, I have a person-to-person call from Binghamton for William
          Boller." Eva would then say "Jessie, is that you Jessie?" and the two
          of them would talk. One of two scenarios would result. <br>
          <br>
          One would go as follows: "Jessie, Billy's not home now, I saw him
          drive to town about half an hour ago. I'll watch for him and flag him
          down when he comes back". Or, "I think he's home, I'll call George
          [Hazlett] to let Billy know you're calling." Then George would send <a
            href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-282">Ralph</a>, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-682">Donald</a>,
          <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-683">Maynard</a>, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-684">Cyril</a>,
          <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-685">Royce</a>, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-686">Georgianna</a>,
          "<a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-686">Mert</a>," <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazett-688">York</a>,
          or "<a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazett-690">Syke</a>" to
          Rose Lawn farm to let Billy know. Because the call was
          person-to-person, he could just go to any neighbor's or Eva's and
          return the call at no expense to them.<br>
          <br>
          The Bollers also had a second home, a house in Nelson, on the south
          side of the main street, a little west of the Presbyterian Church.
          Behind, and below it were flats along the Cowanesque, that were used
          for cow pasture. (I remember being told that one time the cows got
          drunk because a moonshiner dumped mash there --- spoiled the milk for
          a while.) That house was purchased as a mother-in-law house for Phebe
          CAMPBELL Hoyt, who had been living on Rose Lawn Farm with them. She
          only lived there a short time before breaking a hip and returning to
          the farm. Both houses had parlors filled with things fascinating to a
          boy - conch shells, cards covered with arrowheads, stone axes,
          skinning knives, pestles, antlers, uncut semi-precious stones, and
          civil war kit.<br>
          <br>
          Inez must have been a caring person. in addition to caring for her
          mother, after the death of brother <a href="HoytJosephD1860.html">Joseph
            Hoyt</a>, she took in and raised niece Jessica Phoebe Hoyt (my
          mother). The two younger girls (Betty, Isabelle and their mother)
          stayed with their Goodrich grandparents. My mother always referred to
          Inez as "Auntie".<br>
          <br>
          In a addition to doing a little farming, Billy Boller also had a milk
          route. He had a large, stake body truck. He drove two routes, in
          Nelson and Farmington, starting while it was still dark, picking up
          the 50 gallon milk cans the farmers had put out on roadside platforms.
          He managed to do that almost until he died, in spite of the weight of
          a full can. The milk was taken to the Pet Co. plant in Elkland, PA,
          where they made condensed milk (run by Campbell cousin <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Van_Dusen-516">Ross
            Van Dusen</a>. <br>
          <br>
          Billy's truck was an old, stake body, flatbed, red <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REO_Motor_Car_Company">Reo</a>,
          which many of the older residents still remember well. [Once similar
          to this <a href="PhotoReo1920sStakeBodyTruck.jpg">photo</a>.] I never
          saw it him do this, but my mother says that in his first few years of
          having it, when it wouldn't start on a cold morning, he would get a
          horse whip from the barn; then thoroughly whip the truck while
          swearing at it. I don't know how effective that was, but the truck
          stuck with him for a long time. <br>
          <br>
          He was also the leader of the Nelson band. I was told he played a
          tuba, but some of the pictures look like it may have been a baritone
          horn. I remember him "playing" Sousa marches in his sleep. Instead of
          talking in his sleep, you would hear a melodic "Pu-pu-pu-PA-pa-pum".
          He was my namesake. My siblings and I called him "Grampa Bill". - wbt]</i></blockquote>
