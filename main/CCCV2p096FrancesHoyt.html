      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> Am very sure that Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a>
        has never been grandmother to three babies<sup>1</sup> with measles or
        he would not have asked me to write a letter even as important as the
        Cousins Correspondence letter.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We have not only had measles but measles plus. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1266">Baby
          Henry</a> has had bronchitis and an abscess in both ears and a sixteen
        month old baby with all that trouble is considerable care. However, we
        hope they are all on the road to complete recovery.</p>
      <p> As <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1285">Isabelle</a>
        has written the family letter since I have been here<sup>2</sup> you
        will have to pardon me if we tell the same story.</p>
      <p> Talked with <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1276">Betty</a>
        last evening. They have a dandy <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1282">baby
          boy</a> but think <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Walker-36164">Joseph</a>
        will always come first with his "Gram."<sup>3</sup> He has just had his
        half term examinations and passed all his subjects above ninety, which I
        think pretty good for an eight year old boy.</p>
      <p>Am afraid <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1256">Tom</a>,
        Jess' boy, will not be able to go back to school this year. He has a
        slight valvular heart trouble and measles have left him far from strong.</p>
      <p>Isabelle wrote yesterday from Atlantic City that she was enjoying her
        Easter vacation<sup>4</sup> very much She expects to visit Philadelphia
        and Harrisburg on her way home.</p>
      <p>Anticipating much pleasure from the Cousins letters, I extend greetings
        to you all from <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/hoyt-211">Jessica</a>
        and myself.</p>

      <p>2. Frances lived most of the year with her youngest daughter, Isabelle,
        prioor to Isabelle's death, but my mother [Jessica] was a teacher, so
        she needed childcare when my siblings were sick. I was not yet part of
        the scene in 1924 (nor for quite a while after) - wbt</p>
      <p>3. Joe was her first grandchild. - wbt</p>
      <p>4. Isabelle was a P.E. teacher. - wbt</p>
