      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> Greetings to everyone! It is with pleasure that I again make my little
        contribution to the Cousins Book. It is not much, and I am always at a
        loss to know what to say. However, here we are! </p>
      <p> There have been some changes since the last exchange of letters,
        thought I think most of us are about as usual. I, myself, have been
        having a vacation--have not been working since February seventh.
        February eighteenth, the day after my birthday, I underwent an operation
        for goitre at the Arnot-Ogden Hospital in Elmira. Dr. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1577">Ross
          Loop</a>, whom most of you know well, did the job. I am getting along
        just splendidly, and hope to be able to go back to work soon. You all
        know, I think, of <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1102">Father</a>'s
        death. The rest of the family are all well. </p>
      <p> Today the wind is blowing quite a gale and occasionally there are a
        few snowflakes. I have my garden plowed and hope to get some seeds in
        soon. A few of the neighbors have already beaten me to it. </p>
      <p> Wishing you all a pleasant and prosperous year, I am, </p>

      <p> Cordially yours,</p>
