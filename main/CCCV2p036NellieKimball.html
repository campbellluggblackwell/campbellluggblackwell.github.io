      <p>Dear Cousins: </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>Again we are to hear from each other and to feel that we are not so
        widely separated. It will indeed be a pleasure to us to receive the
        package of letters from home, and I am sure the most important work at
        that time will be the reading of them. Perhaps we will hear from some
        who have not written before. Every new member adds to the interest.</p>
      <p>We have glorious news, Cousin <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel</a>
        has written to us that she and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I773">Llewellyn</a>
        are coming for a visit, -- in fact they will spend their twenty-fifth
        wedding anniversary with us, the 12th of July. What a wonderful trip
        they will have motoring from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast, and what
        a joy in store for us!</p>
      <p> We wish more of the Cousins would plan such a holiday. Better have the
        Cousins' Dinner here, July 12th. </p>
      <p>We have been unusually well during the winter, always looking forward
        to <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I820">Faith</a>'s<sup>1</sup>
        occasional visits home. She brought one of her room mates for the spring
        vacation and we had a happy time. </p>
      <p>Will close now with best wishes to all.</p>
