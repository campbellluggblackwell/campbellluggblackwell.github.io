        <p> [This 1937 letter is from Joseph Wallace Buck to his 2nd cousin,
          Mabel SHIPMAN Shaw. Mabel previously had written to Joe Buck, telling
          him about their distant cousin in England, the Rev. Cannon <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Essex-404">Edward
            Claude Essex</a>. In his reply, Joe Buck describes to Mabel a 1867

            Clinch Essex</a> to <a href="CampbellJoseph1839.html">Joseph D.

              C. Essex</a> to my <a href="CampbellJoseph1839.html">grandfather</a>.

              Essex</a>, had written to <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann Clinch</a>

            that they had gotten the address from a letter written in 1818.<sup>2</sup>
            In this letter [the 1867 one - wbt], Peter Clinch Essex, gave the
            following information concerning the children of his (Peter Essex)

          <p> Our Ann Clinch was born January 27, 1804. Her father was Thomas,
            who was born November 12, 1778. I do not know whether or not you
            know it, but I have a silhouette of Thomas Clinch.<sup>3</sup>
            According to my information, he came over on the same ship as the
            Campbells.<sup>4</sup> He settled somewhere in New Jersey, and while
            on a business trip to Philadelphia. he died in one of the yellow
            fever epidemics and was buried there in a common grave.<sup>5</sup>
          </p>
          <p> Ann Clinch, his daughter, then lived with her stepmother<sup>6</sup>
            at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hope,_Pennsylvania">New
              Hope</a>, New Jersey,<sup>7</sup> and it was there that Joseph,
            having met her on the boat and having kept in correspondence with
            her, married her,<sup>8</sup> bringing her home by <a href="https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/couple-riding-a-horse-pillion-17th-century-gm686367054-126114185">pillion</a>.
          </p>
          <p> In this letter of March 30, 1867, Peter told my grandfather that
            at his request, he had secured a birth certificate of Ann Clinch.
            However, I have never been able to find that among the papers.<sup>9</sup>

      <p> 1. I have lots of correspondence from E.. C. Essex, news clips about
        him, and memories of him. I plan to make a new web page for info about
        him. E. C. Essex was a 2nd cousin twice removed of Joe &amp; Mabel. I.e.
        he was a 2nd cousin of their grandfathers. (And a 2nd cousin 3 times
        removed from me.) He liked to be addressed as "Cousin Claude," but when
        talking about him, we often referred to him as "the Cannon."</p>
      <p> 2. Joe Buck doesn't say who the 1818 letter was written to, nor by
        whom, nor who's address it contained. Presumably it was written to Mary
        CLINCH Essex. But who did Mary write to in 1867? In Peter Clinch's 1867
        don't make sense if as Peter says, Mary wrote to Ann CLINCH Campbell
        just before her death. But they do make sense is the person Mary wrote
        to was her former sister-in-law, Sarah LUGG Clinch Blackwell Campbell.
        Here's the chronology:<br>
        <b>1818</b> -- 14 year old Ann Clinch is living in NJ with her foster
        parents, Joshua and Amelia Blackwell. Ann's mother, Sarah, moves to
        Nelson, PA and marries John Campbell; <br>
        <b>1/21/1867</b> -- Sarah LUGG Clinch Blackwell Campbell dies.<br>
        <b>3/301867</b> -- Peter Clinch Essex allegedly wrote to Jos. D.
        Campbell:<br>
        <b>9/12/1867</b> -- Peter's mother, Mary CLINCH Essex, died 9/12/1867,
        almost 6 months after Peter wrote the 3/30 letter;<br>
        <b>2/22/1872</b> -- Ann CLINCH Campbell died.5 years later.<br>
        If the address from the 1818 letter that Mary wrote to in 1867 had been
        Ann's NJ address. Jos. D. Campbell in Nelson, PA would never have
        received it -- it had to have been a Nelson address. But the only one
        living in Nelson in 1818 with a Clinch connection was Sarah. So, the
        1818 letter to Mary must have either been from Sarah or from someone
        telling Mary about Sarah marrying and moving to Nelson. The dates only
        make sense if in 1867 Mary wrote to Mrs. Sarah Campbell, Nelson, PA (or
        to "Mrs. John Campbell"). There's no way to know for sure who the Nelson
        postmaster gave the letter from Mary Essex to, but most likely is was to
        one of Sarah's children living in Nelson, Mary BLACKWELL Campbell or
        Enoch Blackwell, Jr. Either one of them replied to Mary and suggested
        Jos. D. Campbell as the Clinch descendant most likely be interested --
        or they gave Mary's letter to Jos. D. Campbell and he replied- wbt </p>
      <p> 3. Joe's daughter, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Buck-5997">Cornelia
          Buck</a> Key sent me a copy of that silhouette. After the war,
        Cornelia lived for a while in England and met E. C. Essex &amp; a number
        of his siblings, nieces &amp; nephews. Cornelia told me that when Joe
        came to visit her in London, he hosted a dinner party at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown%27s_Hotel">Brown's
          Hotel</a> (then as now, one of London's finest) for about 30 of our
        Essex cousins.-wbt. </p>
      <p> 4. Thomas, <a href="LuggSarah1778.html">Sarah</a> &amp; Ann came over
        in 1805, when Ann was one year old, on the same ship from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol">Bristol</a>
        to Philadelphia that <a href="BlackwellEnoch1764ca.html">Enoch
          Blackwell</a> and his children &amp; siblings sailed on.Ann's future
        husband, Jos. Campbell came over in 1810, sailing from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry">Londonderry,
          N. Ireland</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Amboy,_New_Jersey">Perth
          Amboy, NJ</a>.</p>
      <p> 5. Another account has Thomas' death and burial as being in NYC, but
        Joe may very well be right about it being Philadelphia. </p>
      <p> 6. Ann never had a stepmother. She was raised by foster parents -- one
        of the brothers of her step-father, Enoch Blackwell -- and that
        brother's wife. The late <span wc_id="I2956"> <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Maugeri-7">Stella
            MAUGERI</a></span> Blackwell and I concluded that Ann was raised by
        foster parents <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-2952">Joshua</a>
        and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hey-182">Amelia Hey</a>
        Blackwell. There is no indication that she ever lived with Enoch. </p>
      <p> 7. Some of the time Ann lived in New Hope, Bucks Co., PA. And some of
        the time across the river, in or near, Lambertville, Hunterdon Co., NJ.
      </p>
      <p> 8. The part about riding pillion may be correct. But we know they were
        married in Nelson, PA. The part about meeting on the boat and
        corresponded thereafter is incorrect. As explained in footnote 3 above,
        Ann was one year old at the time of her crossing, which occurred in
        1805. And according to a diary excerpt that Joe quoted in his <a href="CCCV3p072JosWBuck.html">CCC
          letter of 1925</a>, Joseph Campbell made his voyage from Londonderry
        to Perth Amboy, NJ in 1810. </p>
      <p> 9. England didn't begin issuing birth certificates until 1837 -- long
        after Ann had left. Perhaps Peter Essex was referring to a baptismal
        certificate or a christening record. </p>
