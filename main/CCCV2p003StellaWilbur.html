    <div class="Salutation">
      <p>Dear Cousins One and All:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> We have been notified by our very efficient officers that it is time
        for the annual Cousins letter. It is a beautiful morning, -- the sun is
        shining, birds singing, sap running, and we have every evidence that
        spring is here. We have lived through another winter without any serious
        trouble and are looking forward to the garden, flowers, and most
        important, our children and our friends can get to visit us more often.
        Shall look for <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1595">Treva</a>
        and her family at Easter time and <a href="HookerEva1885.html">Eva</a>
        will come about May 1st.<br>
      </p>
      <p> Just at present the roads are almost impassable<sup>1</sup>. Nelson
        has been moving, -- a Springtime pleasure,-- but with very good results.
        Where we used to have seven Campbell families on this side<sup>2</sup>
        of the river, we have that many good Farmington <span class="Annotation">[Township
          - wbt]</span> families now, who are a great help to the Church and
        town, and several more across the river, -- while there is just one left
        who can claim the name of Campbell and that is <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1615">Ida
          Campbell</a> Eaton.</p>
      <p> I want to say that <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1532">Clifford
          Young</a> need not think that the pleasure was all on his side, while
        he was preaching to us that summer, for we enjoyed having him with us,
        especially in the pulpit of the Church<sup>3</sup>, -- that is sacred in
        the eyes of the Campbell family. We have a very efficient man here at
        present, -- the Rev. F. B. McFeely.</p>
      <p> As usual, Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a>
        picked the right ones to be the officers of this Correspondence Club and
        we are very fortunate to have so many able ones among out numbers.</p>
      <p> <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie Congdon</a> made me a visit
        recently, -- we always enjoy his visits.</p>
      <p>You will all be glad that Mr. and Mrs. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I986">O.
          B. Blanchard</a> are living in <a href="CampbellJoseph1839.html">Uncle
          Joe</a>'s house. It was so dismal up there while the house was vacant.</p>
      <p>Will just say in closing that I am quite likely to be "At home" all
        summer and hope that none of you will forget where I live for I shall be
        very glad to see you.</p>
