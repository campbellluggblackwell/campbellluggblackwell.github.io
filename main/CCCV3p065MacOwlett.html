        Dear Cousins:

      <p>
        Well, I shall write a few lines. Have just got settled and things are
        going fine so far, and I hope they will continue for the season. I work
        on a farm of about eighty-five acres with about twenty acres of fruit,
        which consists of apples, peaches, pears, prunes and cherries. We have
        just been spraying the trees for the first time in the season. Last
        year we had a lot of fruit on this place, but most of the folks in this
        country think there will not be so much this year. I have been working
        on a farm here all winter.

        Father</a>'s sudden death in September. While I was out there this
        spring we made a little maple syrup and a little sugar. I guess they
        were all glad to see me out in that country.
      </p>
      <p>
        The land in this part of the country is almost all level ground. The
        soil is mostly sand. We have not done any farm work yet as a little
        snow flurry we had the other day made the ground too wet to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hoping you all enjoy this letter, I am,
      </p>
