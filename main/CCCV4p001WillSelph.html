      <p>Dear Cousins:-</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> Our book of letters for this year must be closed this morning and this
        particular letter should really be the last in the book rather than the
        first, - but I wanted to say a word to you all at the very beginning of
        the book.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In our endeavor to make our book this year as interesting and dignified
        as possible, you will note that we have been favored with letters from a
        very few very close friends of the Campbell family. These letters I am
        sure will be very much appreciated by us all.</p>
      <p> At the Cousins Dinner last fall we were fortunate in having three
        photographs taken, and these have been&nbsp; reproduced in this year's
        book.</p>
      <p> Through the suggestion and kindness of Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1244">Mary
          Hughey</a> of Brainerd, Minn., we have been able to include two very
        valuable historical papers written by Aunt <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Jane
          Tubbs</a>, -- "<a href="MemoriumClinchAnn1804.html">Mother's Memoir</a>"
        probably written in the late 90's and a "<a href="CCCV4p088HistoryCampbells.html">History
          of the Campbells</a>", read at the Campbell Reunion in August, 1901 -
        twenty-five years ago. As a matter of permanent record for us all I
        could think of nothing better than to have these valuable papers
        reproduced in our book of this year. The hardships and privations of
        those early days are most vividly portrayed in these papers.</p>
      <p>We were also fortunate to have at hand, just in time, a complete
        account of the Golden Wedding Anniversary of <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a>
        and <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">Frank Campbell</a> down in St.
        Petersburg, Fla., and this has been reproduced in our book.</p>
      <p>Although we have been somewhat disappointed at not hearing from many of
        the Cousins, yet we have a most interesting book and I sincerely hope
        all of the Cousins and friends will thoroughly enjoy reading same.</p>
