                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has not much happened in the
                family since my last letter, so I am going to tell you
                about our trip last winter to New Orleans and St.
                Petersburg.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

                and I left New York about the middle of March on one of
                the coldest days of the winter on the steamer "Momus"
                for New Orleans. Our Insurance Company has an annual
                convention for their officers and agents in different
                places, and two years ago we went to Palm Beach. I wish
                to say that if you ever have an opportunity to go to
                Florida, do not turn it down for it is a wonderful
                experience. It was about zero when we left New York, and
                the second day out we were off the coast of Florida with
                the mercury about 75 degrees. Of course, we sat out on
                deck all day and part of the night, and thereafter for
                four days. The boat did not make any stops until we
                reached the mouth of the Mississippi River where we were
                obliged to wait for a river pilot. New Orleans is about
                one hundred miles up the river.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The climate was about like June up
                here. New Orleans is a wonderful old city, it being the
                second largest port in the United States, and I was much
                surprised to see about as many ships at anchor as you
                see in New York Harbor. The city is several feet below
                the river, and as a consequence all of the sewage has to
                be pumped out, and all of the dead are buried above
                ground. There is one cemetery where the say one cannot
                be buried for leas than $10,000. (ten thousand.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is certainly very beautiful to
                view the marble vaults and mausoleums. The poorer class
                of the city have to be buried in vaults with some
                chemical to eat up the remains, and then the ashes are
                removed to make room for some other body.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We took a "rubbernecks&#8221; trip through
                the old French Quarters and saw some buildings over two
                hundred years old. We also saw the "Orleans Hotel" which
                was built in 1799 and the "Absinthe House" built in
                1798. We went into a Catholic Church where they were
                holding services, that had been standing for one hundred
                twenty eight years; this was in perfectly good repair.
                The main street (Canal Street) of the city is very wide
                with four street car tracks and room for four
                automobiles abreast on each side. This was originally a
                canal and has been filled in, making a beautiful street.
                The principal hotel is "The Grunewald" where the
                Convention&#8209;headquarters were. In the basement of this
                hotel is a mammoth cave built to represent rocks. There
                were five or six hundred of us seated in this cave and
                served to a very delicious luncheon. </font></p>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; March 2nd was my birthday, so Mrs.
                Young and I went to the Country Club in the morning;&#8209; I
                played eighteen holes of golf and then came in and
                inspected the Country Club, which was the finest one I
                have ever seen;&#8209; and then we enjoyed a delicious
                luncheon served under the largest oak tree I have seen.
                We enjoyed two or three hours under this tree winding up
                with a dinner at the hotel, Which ended "A Perfect Day".<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We sailed from New Orleans for St.
                Petersburg &#8209; a two days' sail over the Gulf of Mexico.
                The mercury was about 75 degrees all the way. I never
                tire of watching the water with flying dish and quite
                often a school of porpoises, and one lady was sure she
                saw a whale.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wired to Cousin <a
                  href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommy Campbell</a> to
                engage a room in his hotel, but he had rented the hotel
                and was living in a beautiful private home, and instead
                of getting us a room somewhere he took us home with him.
                We had a delightful time while there. I played golf on
                the two courses there, and he took us for a fine motor
                trip to Tampa, Bellaire, etc. <a

                were there and they all gave us a fine time. Tommy is
                getting rich along with the rest of the people down
                there dealing in real estate. Real estate values are so
                multiplied down there I will not attempt to quote them.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, I repeat, if you can go South
                to spend a winter, or, if you can go for only a week, do
                so,&#8209; you never will regret it, but go way down as far as
                St. Petersburg or Florida.<br>
