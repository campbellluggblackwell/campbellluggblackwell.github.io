      <p>Dear Campbell Cousins:-</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>I am very much pleased to have the opportunity to write to the Campbell
        Cousins. I have often read my <a href="TubbsLeah1884.html">Mother</a>'s
        letters from the Cousins and she has told me who they all are and where
        they live but I know very few of them.</p>
      <p>We have had a very long, cold winter. Coal has been scarce but we were
        fortunate to have ours in the bin<sup>1</sup>. Today has been lots
        warmer and it makes you feel good to even think of Spring.</p>
      <p><a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1347">Cassius</a>,
        my husband, works in the Condensery<sup>2</sup>, but work is not very
        plentiful.</p>
      <p>We have a little boy whose name is <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1350">Keith</a>.
        He is three years old the first of April. The thing he likes to do best
        is to "go to Grandma's house".</p>
      <p>Well now I have written really more than I intended to when I sat down
        and hope to have a chance to write again sometime.</p>
      <p>Will close with greetings and best wishes to all the Cousins.<br>

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>1.&nbsp; After the advent of furnaces and central heat, house in the
        wintry regions usually had coal bins in the basement, often as the first
        room in the front. Coal delivery companies would send truck to deliver
        anywhere from a half ton to several tons, depending on the size of the
        coal bin and the amount of cash on hand. People with coal stoves often
        bought coal by the bag (40, 50 or 100 lbs/bag). Coal delivery day was an
        exciting time or a kid. The truck would back up next to the house (snow
        permitting), they would open a cellar window, insert steel chutes, and
        then shovel the coal onto the chute. It would make a glorious whooshing
        sound as it slid down the chute, and a different noise as it cascaded
        off the end of the chute and fell to the floor. Often one of the
        delivery men would have to be in the coal bin shoveling the coal off to
        a side to make room for the falling coal. Or sometimes they could change
        the angle or length of the chute to make the coal fall in a different
        direction. It was an exciting event for a preschooler to watch.</p>
      <p>2. It was in Elkland. Milk route drivers would bring in flat bed trucks
        of milk cans from the dairy farms. They would load the cans onto a
        conveyor, load the empty cans on the truck when they came down, and
        return the empty cans to the milk route trucks, and the drivers would
        return them to the farms The condensery turned the raw milk into
        consumer sized cans of Pet brand condensed milk. Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1448">Ross
          Van Dusen</a> managed the plant until his untimely death.</p>
