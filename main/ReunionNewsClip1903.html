      <p>The tenth annual reunion of the Campbell family was held at Nelson,
        Pa., August 20. 1903. The weather being perfect, in spite of the
        threatening aspect of the skies of the morning, the meeting took place
        on the school grounds, as heretofore; at an early hour the gathering of
        the clan commenced.</p>
      <p>Refreshments were served at 1 o'clock, and as soon as the meal was over
        the family was called to order by <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I100">E.
          B. Campbell</a>, the President, and the musical and literary program
        was taken up.</p>
      <p>This was heralded by a beautifully rendered instrumental and vocal
        selection by Prof. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1636">C.
          B. Campbell</a>, of Hedgesville, N. Y., who led with the violin, and
        was accompanied by <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1673">Mrs.
          Campbell</a> with the cornet, and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1616">Mr.
          Eaton</a> on the organ.</p>
      <p><a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I925">G.
          W. Buck</a>, Esq., of Elmira, N. Y., at this time gave the address of
        welcome. He spoke of the power of character, and of the value of
        endurance, and showed how these qualities had enabled the founders of
        this family to endure the hardships and labor so heroically in the days
        gone by. He pointed to the lessons of the year just past, and to the
        possibilities of the year to come. He emphasized the value of good
        citizenship, and the power of the individual; and declared that the
        "Welcome" was through the gateway of honest endeavor.</p>
      <p>At this time came the election of officers for the ensuing year, and
        the following were elected:<br>
        <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">T. C. Campbell</a>, Knoxville,
        President.<br>
        <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I103">J.
          C. Campbell</a>, Elkland, Vice Pres.<br>
        <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2369">E.
          C. Blackwell</a>, Nelson, Secretary.<br>
        <a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">M. B. Seely</a>, Nelson, Treasurer.</p>
      <p> Letters of regret were presented and read by the Secretary, the
        following persons having so written:<br>
        "The Bucks,"<sup>1</sup> Stroudsburg, Pa.<br>
        L. Roundsville,<sup>2</sup> Bay City, Mich.<br>
        <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">E. T. Congdon</a>, Tacoma, Wash.<br>
        L. C. Smart and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2144">wife</a>,
        Wellsboro, Pa.</p>
      <p>Also a letter received from <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1846">Ed.
          C. Green</a>, who wrote from 300 miles north of Resurrection Bay in
        Alaska.</p>
      <p> The company was then charmed with a vocal duet my Misses <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I780">Helen
          Shipman</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I846">Edna
          Ellison</a>. They sang "If I Only Could Bring Back the Past." Being
        encored they sang "Old Fashioned Roses." </p>
      <p>Under the general topic "Genealogy and Reminiscences," President E. B.
        Campbell in a few well chosen ... [section missing from clipping]</p>
      <p>Prof. C. B. Campbell and wife then gave a coronet duet, which delighted
        everybody.</p>
      <p>An original poem was then read my Miss <a href="SeelyLena1873.html">Lena
          Seely</a>,<sup>3</sup> which was so apt and witty and telling, and
        altogether appropose <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> that it was
        unanimously voted to give it a place in the minutes and have it
        published. It was as follows:<br>
        In the quiet town of Nelson,<br>
        Where Cowanesque's waters sound,<br>
        Neath the stately trees of maple,<br>
        On the old school ground;<br>
        Comes a goodly band of pilgrims,<br>
        From the city and the town,<br>
        From the hills and from the valleys,<br>
        From all the country round.<br>
        <br>
        They're not followers of Mohammed,<br>
        Come to worship at a shrine;<br>
        But a band of jolly Campbells<br>
        Whom love and friendship bind<br>
        Every year in month of August,<br>
        Into one great family,<br>
        Who forget their cares and sorrows<br>
        In hours of pleasantry. <br>
        Some come with baskets laden,<br>
        And some with freezers chill,<br>
        Some some with pails to fill;<br>
        Each face is brightly lighted,<br>
        This is not a day to frown,<br>
        And a face that isn't smiling,<br>
        Is a thing that can't be found.<br>
        <br>
        No one is old in this company, <br>
        All are young today;<br>
        And though the years are many<br>
        And the hair has long been gray;<br>
        Their hearts are young and joyous,<br>
        And cares they all forget,<br>
        Though they soon will cross the river,<br>
        And the sun for them will set.<br>
        <br>
        There are faces that are missing,<br>
        And ones not seen before;<br>
        They smile to greet the new ones,<br>
        Sigh for those seen no more.<br>
        But there's one thought to remember,<br>
        As we think of friends so dear,<br>
        That in spirit they are with us,<br>
        Are ever hovering near.<br>
        <br>
        They talk of the days of their childhood,<br>
        And the stories whispered oe'r,<br>
        Of the time when the war was raging,<br>
        Of the loved ones gone before;<br>
        Of their hopes for the unseen future,<br>
        Of how they worked and saved,<br>
        To do the best for their children,<br>
        Of the nation's problems grave.<br>
        <br>
        And the air is filled with the music<br>
        Of children's voices gay,<br>
        And a livelier lot could not be found,<br>
        If one searched for many a day;<br>
        And their hearts are content and happy,<br>
        When they come to the old school ground,<br>
        If over the fence, they spy the face,<br>
        Of the man with the merry-go-round.<br>
        <br>
        Now comes the best of all the day,<br>
        For they are hungry, no mistake,<br>
        And the tables groan with the weight they bear,<br>
        Of chicken, and salad, and cake;<br>
        They talk, and laugh, and eat and drink<br>
        Nothing stronger than iced tea,<br>
        And of goodies brought from home that morn,<br>
        There is not much left to see.<br>
        <br>
        And then they gather, one and all,<br>
        Beneath the cooling shade,<br>
        There are officers to be elected,<br>
        Speeches to be made;<br>
        Recitations, songs to be sung,<br>
        History read which tells,<br>
        Of the origin of this sturdy race,<br>
        The clan of the Campbells.<br>
        <br>
        Now suddenly the sun is sinking,<br>
        There is hurrying to and fro,<br>
        With regrets and good-byes are now being said,<br>
        For it is time to go;<br>
        When we meet in August, nineteen four,<br>
        Let us hope and pray,<br>
        That not a visage will be missed,<br>
        Of those gathered here today.</p>
      <p>Interesting remarks were made by Dr. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I212">Chas.

      <p><a href="CampbellWilliam1864.html">W. C. Campbell</a>, of Marinette,
        Wis., was then called to the front and gave a most neat and witty
        speech, so replete with personal facts that it <del>was heard to strike
          several individuals present with the thud of a shot which has found
          its target.</del> was most entertaining <span class="Annotation">[written

        happily.</p>

          H. Lugg</a>, of Coudersport, Pa., being introduced, gave one of the
        best addresses of the day. It was an inspiration to all who desire to
        make the most of life in this day when "To be living is sublime."</p>
      <p><a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">W. E. Selph</a>, of Brooklyn,
        accompanied by <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1692">Mrs.
          Mary Shewman</a>, gave a grand rendition of the beautiful solo,
        "Asleep in the Deep." He was called on for a speech and spoke five
        minutes upon the Nobler Aims in Life, and made an impassioned appeal to
        the youth of the audience, to live for high ideals. All were the better
        for having listened to his stirring words, and were in a mood to
        appreciate the song which followed. "Grant We May Meet Again."</p>
      <p>A collection was taken to defray the necessary expenses $9.06 being
        asked for and $11.00 received.</p>
      <p>There were 142 relatives present.</p>
      <p>All joined in singing "God Be With You Till We Meet Again," and the
        meeting was adjourned.</p>
