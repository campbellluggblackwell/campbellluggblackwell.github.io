      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> I did not think that I had much to say so was not going to send a
        letter this time and along came a note from <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin
          Will</a> saying "Don't disappoint us," so I guess it's up to me to sit
        right down in the midst of my housecleaning epidemic, with a
        paper-hanger upstairs and a painter in the kitchen, and write this
        letter.<br>
      </p>
      <p> All housekeepers know what confusion I am in, especially in a bungalow
        where all the rooms open up together. But I ought to be clean enough
        when settled so that when the Cousins start out on their vacations, they
        can hit Johnson City at meal time or night and stop with us.</p>
      <p> Last November 11th being our anniversary, also <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I14492">Mother</a>
        and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I14491">Father
          Hill</a>'s, we all drove home and spent the Sunday with <a href="LoopStella1863.html">Mamma</a>
        in Nelson. The men folks helped bank up the house<sup>1</sup> and fix
        the farm for winter.</p>
      <p> Christmas we all ate turkey with <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1595">Treva</a>
        and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I666">Jack</a>.
        Mamma was able to eat dinner there too and we did enjoy it so much.</p>
      <p> February 15th being Mamma's birthday, we drove home and helped her
        celebrate; but the roads were so bad<sup>2</sup>, we have not tried to
        go home since.</p>
      <p>Treva and Jack drove up here March 30th for dinner to celebrate <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1596">Anne
          Taylor</a>'s seventh birthday with a pink cake and candles.</p>
      <p>I can remember a few things about our Aunts and Uncles; -- Once when we
        lived in Elmira, <a href="CampbellSarah1824.html">Aunt Sally</a> and <a
          href="CampbellMaryAnn1826.html">Aunt Mary Ann</a> came to visit us but
        could not sleep because of the noise of the trains. We lived miles from
        the railroads too.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Footnote">1. Many houses, with or without cellars, sat on "dry"
      stone foundations, i.e. no mortar or cement binding them, so the cold wind
      blew threw them. And there usually was no insulation under the floor. So,
      people piled up leaves or straw against the foundations, and usually
      covered that with dirt to hold it in place.&nbsp; - wbt]<br>
      <br>
      2. If the "bad road" problem persisted this late into April, she was
      probably referring to the deep ruts that occurred in dirt roads every
      Spring --- and most roads were unpaved then. It was difficult to drive a
      car on the roads then without getting stuck or risk breaking an axle.<br>

      <p>I can see Aunt Sally baking a pie by the kitchen table while <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I917">Uncle
          Ben</a> took a nap on the lounge behind the door, with his bandana
        over his face. Later when he visited us alone, he made me a wonderful
        "fiddle" our of a cigar box. He could play good music on it too.</p>
      <p> <a href="CampbellEleanor1828.html">Aunt Eleanor</a> always reminds me
        of beautifully pieced bed quilts. <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">Aunt
          Phebe</a> lived long enough so we all can remember lots of nice things
        she did for us.</p>
      <p><a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1591">Ed</a>
        was in Boston, New York and Philadelphia on business<sup>3</sup> last
        week during the "April snow and thunderstorms."</p>

        has been very well since his second attack of pneumonia last November.</p>
      <p>We hope that during the summer we may see some of the Cousins either at
        our home or on some of the trips we anticipate taking.</p>
