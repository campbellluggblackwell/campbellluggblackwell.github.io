    <h1>Campbells of Nelson, PA</h1>
    <h2>WHO CAME WHEN?<br>
      (Our Best Guess)</h2>
    <h2> APPROXIMATE TIMELINE</h2>
    <p><span id="ParaHead">ca 1776.</span> Teenager <a href="CampbellJohn1761.html">John
        Campbell</a> arrives in Philadelphia from Scotland, perhaps as a boy
      apprentice tailor. He later opens a tailor shop, and by 1800&nbsp; becomes
      a land agent there. </p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">ca 1800 -1802.</span> Newlyweds <a href="HazlettSamuel1780.html">Samuel
        Hazlett</a> and <a href="CampbellSarah1778.html">Sarah "Sally" Campbell</a>,
      John's niece, arrive in the US and settle in Lancaster Co., PA., perhaps
      accompanied by younger brother <a href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John
        Hazlett</a>. Sam was born in Scotland. Sally and John were either born
      in Scotland or N. Ireland. Sam and Sally lived in N. Ireland before coming
      to America.</p>
    <p> At he same time, or perhaps a couple of years later, Sally's siblings, <a
        href="CampbellJohn1781.html">John</a>, <a href="CampbellMary1779.html">Mary</a>,
      and <a href="CampbellElizabeth1789.html">Elizabeth Campbell</a> (who
      later became nephews and nieces of the above mentioned John Campbell) come
      from N. Ireland to Lancaster Co. and settle there. </p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1803.</span> <span wc_id="I38"><a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-623">Archibald
          Hazlett</a></span> is born in Lancaster Co. to Sam and Sally.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1804.</span> In Glouchestershire, the Rev. <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hey-333">John
        Hey</a> [the infamous one, not the famous one] forms "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Township,_Lycoming_County,_Pennsylvania">The
        English Company</a>" to invest in wilderness lands in Pennsylvania. The
      Blackwells, who own textile mills, invest. <a href="BlackwellEnoch1764ca.html">Enoch
        Blackwell</a>'s 28 yr. old brother, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-2952">Joshua
        Blackwell</a>, accompanied by Enoch's son, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-2566">Wm.
        Perrin Blackwell</a> (then 10 yrs. old) are sent to accompany Rev. Hey
      to assist him (or to keep an eye on him).</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">ca 1804.</span> Sally's brother John Campbell
      marries Pennsylvanian Elizabeth Bell and moves near Pittsburgh, PA. (It
      gets confusing with all the different John Campbells, Joseph Campbells,
      John &amp; Sam Hazletts, etc.)</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1805.</span> The "English Company" buys 110,000
      acres of wilderness in Lycoming &amp; Tioga Cos., PA -- apparently sight
      unseen. <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Clinch-347">Thomas Clinch</a>,
      wife <a href="LuggSarah1778.html"> Sarah Lugg </a>, and baby <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann
        Clinch</a> leave Avening in Gloucestershire, sail from Bristol, England
      and arrive in Philadelphia. On the same ship, also from Avening, are
      widower Enoch Blackwell, his children, and several of his siblings. Thomas
      Clinch dies in NYC of yellow fever. His widow, Sarah LUGG Clinch marries
      Enoch Blackwell and moves to Pine Twp., Lycoming Co. Sarah leaves daughter
      Ann Clinch with Enoch's brother, Joshua Blackwell and his wife, to be
      raised by them near New Hope, Bucks Co., PA.</p>
    <p> The Campbells and Hazletts were staunch Presbyterians and the Luggs and
      Clinches were Anglicans. Some, perhaps all, of the Blackwells were
      Baptists.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1806.</span> Sally's sister Mary Campbell marries
      N. Irelander <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-619">John
        Hazlett</a> (as far as we know unrelated to Sam and John), in Lancaster
      Co. <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary Blackwell</a> is born in Pine
      Twp. to Enoch Blackwell and Sarah Lugg. </p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">ca 1806.</span> A pioneer, Daniel Strait, briefly
      settles in Tioga Co., PA near a Cowanesque River island owned by a family
      named Beecher. Strait builds a cabins and saw mill, but moves on. Sam
      Hazlett begins buying his land.&nbsp; Subsequently, Sally's uncle, John
      Campbell, in Philadelphia and her father, <a href="CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph
        Campbell</a>, still in N. Ireland, begin buying the island, and land on
      the south bank of the Cowanasque, from the Beecher family. Sam's land is a
      little to the east, on the north side of the river, along what is now
      called Strait Creek.. At that time, only a few, small clearings had been
      made and there were no roads. The small community that grew up there, not
      surprisingly, came to be called <a href="BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's
        Island</a>. Later, for reasons unknown, when the first post office was
      opened, postal officials named it <span style="font-style: italic;">Nelson</span>.
      The name <span style="font-style: italic;">Beecher's Island</span>
      gradually died out. It long continued as the name of the Presbyterian
      church, but even there, newspapers eventually began referring to it as the
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Presbyterian Church of Nelson</span>.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1810.</span> Sam completes his purchase of land
      from Daniel Strait. By this time Sam and Sally, have two more children,
      Mary (1807) and Jane Hazlett (1810).&nbsp; Sally's parents, Joseph and <a
        href="HarperMary1749.html">Mary HARPER Campbell</a>, and their younger
      children --- <a href="CampbellJane1792.html">Jane</a>, <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph</a>,
      and <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James</a> --- sail from Londonderry,
      N. Ireland to Perth Amboy, NJ, arriving in Oct. and make their way to
      Sam's farm believed to be near Stroudsburg, where they are joined by Uncle
      John Campbell from Philadelphia. In late 1810 or early 1811 they all set
      out for Beecher's Island, forming their own wagon train and accompanied by
      all their livestock. Reportedly they arrived on New Year's eve. We know
      they did encounter deep snow during the trek, they found Daniel Strait's
      cabin just a shell, and only a few rusted remnants of the saw mill. But
      the Beecher's cabin apparently was intact. See <a href="NelsonMap.html">Nelson
        map</a>.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1811.</span> John Hazlett marries Jane Campbell,
      Sally's sister. Some time after that, Sam sells or gives or sells the land
      on the north side of the river, along Strait Creek, to John, and relocates
      to Thornbottom Creek, west of Beecher's Island, and builds a saw mill
      there. As does James Campbell.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1814.</span> <a href="BlackwellEnoch1814.html">Enoch
        Blackwell</a> is born in Jersey Shore, PA to Enoch and Sarah LUGG Clinch
      Blackwell. (Enoch "Sr" also had a son Enoch by his first wife.)</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1816.</span> Enoch Blackwell "Sr." dies.
      Subsequently, we don't know when, Sarah marries her 3rd husband --- former
      tailor John Campbell. Sarah and her two younger children, Mary and Enoch
      Blackwell, move to Beecher's Island. At some point, John builds a grist
      mill and a fulling mill (hammers cloth to make felt).</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1821.</span> Sarah LUGG Clinch Blackwell writes to
      daughter Ann Clinch, suggesting she marry Sarah's nephew, Joseph Campbell.<span
        id="ParaHead">.</span> Ann Clinch marries Joseph Campbell. A week later,
      her half-sister, Mary Blackwell, marries Joseph's brother, James Campbell.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1824.</span> Mary CAMPBELL Hazlett dies in
      Lancaster Co. Afterwards, her husband ("the other" John Hazlett) and their
      children move to a farm next to brother John Campbell's. At that time, it
      was near Pittsburgh. Now their properties are within Pittsburgh's North
      side.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1830.</span> Sarah LUGG Clinch Blackwell Campbell's
      youngest brother, <a href="LuggCharles1791.html">Charles Byron Lugg</a>,
      and his family come to Tioga Co., PA from Gloucestershire. They initially
      settle in Elkland, but soon relocate to Thornbottom Creek, just west of
      Beecher's Island.</p>
    <p> <span id="ParaHead">1831.</span> C.B. Lugg and family move back to
      England.</p>
    <p><span id="ParaHead">1833.</span> C. B. Lugg and family return to Tioga
      Co. --- this time for good. They settle in Farmington Twp.</p>
