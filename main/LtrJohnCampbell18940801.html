        1. In the upper left corner of the stationary there is an embossed
        image of a building -- unidentified so far. John was born on a farm
        that was then "near Pittsburgh," but apparently later became part of
        Pittsburgh's North Side. The farm he retired from was in McCandless
        Twp., Allegheny Co., PA. His new home, at Dehaven Station, on Murray
        Ave., is in present Allison Park, Hampton Twp., Allegheny Co. I have
        visited his grave in nearby Hampton Cem.-wbt
