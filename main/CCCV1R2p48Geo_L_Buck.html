              Cousins:<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my debut in this
              Correspondence Club, representing as I do the second
              edition, that is, the second generation of this
              illustrious cycle of alleged descendants of the Duke of
              Argyle, styled by our enterprising <a
                href="SelphWilliam1871.html">secretary</a> the "Campbell
              Cousins", timidity seems to inhibit all news sense, if
              indeed such an equipment ever occupied this upper story.
              True, the setting for a real effusion is superb&#8209;but that
              is where we seem to stop. Perhaps the brain cells need a
              dish of bran.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I am on the afternoon train
              between Boston and New York, speeding along the Sound.
              During a short period in October of each year I think this
              is one of the most beautiful train trips to be had
              anywhere in America. True there is no particular grandeur
              of scenery such as may be enjoyed in sections of the West,
              but more gorgeous coloring I have never seen. Old Dame
              Nature operating on the varied New England foliage at this
              period of the year always produces a riot of color that no
              brush can reproduce, and no matter how worldly ones
              thoughts or ways, he is here reminded that the Infinite is
              always the Master Hand.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have just reached New Haven
              and are told the Giants win the first championship game
              four to three. Rather stale news this will be when it
              reaches its destination. A discussion as to who invented
              Thanksgiving would perhaps be more opportune at that time.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most correspondents in this group
              in their initial appearance seem fittingly to have
              unburdened themselves of a few family statistics. Well my
              family is large. You think I mean large in number but what
              I really mean is that Anna, my wife, weighs one hundred
              and seventy&#8209;five pounds (although she is trying to reduce
              by eating only what the children and sometimes the dog
              won't eat in addition to her usual three meals a day). In
              point of number, we are a quartet. Donald is now thirteen
              and Gordon Campbell ten, both in Public Schools of
              Madison, New Jersey, where we have lived for over a year.
              We lived two years in Boston, or in a suburb of Boston,
              Wellesley Hills, having moved there from Chicago in 1920.
              Now that is our family history and it's simple, isn't it?<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our modes of life are equally
              simple. We eat in the kitchen mostly, spend more time with
              the flowers and other things about the place than we do in
              thought or participation in</font></font></p>

              snapshot furnished for the Cousins' album was taken on
              Labor Day just before we started to take mother to the
              train to return to her home at Watkins. Uncle <a
                href="CongdonCharles1856.html">C.H. Congdon</a> had
              happened along for the week end. Just recently Helen

                Congdon</a>'s wife, paid us a brief but much appreciated
              visit. She gave us first hand news of the Cousins' Dinner.
              We wanted to attend that Cousins' Dinner and really had
              planned to, but Gordon had to play sick the week before
              and we thought best to give up the trip.<br>
