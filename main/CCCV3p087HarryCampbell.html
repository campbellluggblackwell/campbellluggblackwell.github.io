      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> Half an hour ago I awakened with the thought "I'm leaving on the 10:10
        train for Vienna, Austria,-packing is not finished and a letter must be
        gotten off now for the cousins or it won't catch the 'S.S.Mauretania'
        sailing Saturday." Isn't that enough to rouse a man from his downy bed?
      </p>
      <p> Since I last wrote you our little family has made many moves and many
        plans, and at times it seems our lives have proceeded at a fast and
        furious gait. </p>
      <p> On April twenty-fifth last year <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1479">Catharine</a>
        and I sailed for America, leaving the children in Paris. We were home
        about four weeks. During my stay I visited <a href="SebringCarrie1863.html">Mother</a>
        and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1482">William</a>
        in Elmira--a mighty good visit it was, too.</p>
      <p> Just before Decoration Day<sup>1</sup>, Mother, William, my live-wire
        nephew <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1484">Wilfred</a>,(Bill's
        one and only) and I drove to Nelson armed with red geraniums for <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1476">Father</a>'s
        grave. I always like to reminisce, so to speak. So when we drove up to
        the cemetery my thoughts ran back night unto forty years ago when I used
        to go to church with Grandpa, <a href="CampbellJohn1836.html">John H.</a>,
        as they all called him, and sit back in the corner near the choir. Mr.
        Armstrong preached the sermon, <a href="SeelyLena1873.html">Lena Seely</a>,
        <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I986">Benny
          Blanchard</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2369">Charlie
          Blackwell</a>, if I remember correctly, were part of the choir, and
        Cousins <a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">Mark</a> and Jim Losey<sup>2</sup>
        passed the collection plates. Didn't Mr. Losey's shoes squeak at times?
        Another thing I remember, too, how pretty were the little girls, Clara
        and Florence Baxter<sup>3</sup>! Well, I mustn't ramble too much or I
        won't catch my train. That day Mother had prepared a delicious lunch of
        cold chicken with all the rest of the fixin's. We ate on the porch of
        the little farm house across from the pine grove just before one reaches
        the railroad tracks on the way to Elkland. We stepped in on the way back
        to say "Hello" to Cousin Mark. The old store looks just the same--the
        candy counter is in the same place<sup>4</sup> and I think the coveted
        showcase of jackknives has not changed its place. And Cousin Mark was
        there, too, his same genial self. That day we saw Cousin <a href="LoopStella1863.html">Stella</a>
        down at the little house where I first saw the light of day and, from
        what Mother says, where I first learned the delight of wandering. </p>
      <p> Well, to get back to Europe, we arrived in Paris about the middle of
        June and immediately took the family to Fontainebleau where I studied
        all summer. After our return to Paris it </p>

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>1. The original name of Memorial Day.</p>
      <p>2. James Taggert Losey (1843 - 1911) was the brother of Mark's wife.</p>
      <p>3. Clara &amp; Florence Baxter weren't "blood relatives", but they were
        "connected." Clarissa Madge BAXTER Smith (1883 - ?) was a friend of my
        mother. I have lots of photos ---- very pretty. Florence E. BAXTER Davis
        (1886 - 1946) lived in the nice house with Grecian columns near Nelson's
        Presbyterian church. I visited her many times with my mother. Clara and
        Florence were daughters of Dr. Calvin Scott Baxter (1860 - 1921) &amp;
        his 1st wife, Harriet E. Elderkin (1861 - 1888). Calvin was the brother
        of <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I686">Eva
          BAXTER</a> Foster Hazlett. Calvin was a son of Hon. Geo. Henry Baxter
        (1824 - 1892), whose first wife was <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I93">Sarah

    <div>
      <p>was not many weeks before Catharine had a very serious illness, and to
        make a complete recovery it was necessary to get into a sunny climate.
        All my singing life I have had the desire to study with the great master
        and tenor, Jean De Reske. For ten years Jean De Reske has been teaching
        in Nice, here on the sunny coast of southern France. It seemed the one
        logical place to visit, so here we have been since the first of the
        year.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> I got on so famously with the master we made plans to be near him this
        coming summer and for another year, so Catharine and I again made
        arrangements to sail in April for a four weeks visit home, leaving the
        family here in our apartment in Nice. </p>
      <p> But--our dear master has passed away and is being buried today in
        Paris. M. De Reske caught cold, congestion of the lungs set in, and the
        poison from that got into his system and--we lost him. It was a great
        loss to his family, his household, his students and the world. Everybody
        paid him tribute at the service in Nice on Monday. The whole gamut of
        the social scale was covered; King Manuel of Portugal, the Duke of
        Connaught, down to a couple of beggars Catharine says she saw there
        saying a last prayer for a man beloved by the whole world. </p>
      <p> With the passing of M. De Reske my plans were changed. I cancelled the
        sailing for next Wednesday and made application for another to include
        all of us in the "De Grasse" leaving Havre, June twenty-fourth. During
        the interim before that date there is much to do. </p>
      <p> I want to prepare one of my operatic roles in Vienna which is a great
        musical center. The Austrians are not Huns<sup>5</sup>, and they are
        fond of the Americans; thus, I have no compunctions about going there.
        In a month I shall be back here in Nice, thence to Paris for a few
        weeks, and then home to family, friends and hard work. </p>
      <p> It is 6:37 A. M. and that baggage is not packed. </p>
    </div>
