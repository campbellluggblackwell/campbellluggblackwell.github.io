    <div class="Salutation">
      <p>Dear Kith and Kin, One and All:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> With many months having passed since your most interesting letters,
        and with the numerous changes which have come in the history of our Clan
        since our last issue. I am looking forward with great anticipation to
        the receipt of this coming "budget" of the Cousins Correspondence. </p>
      <p> My first thought in beginning my visit with you is that I am truly
        proud of the intense loyalty to the enterprise which prompted sixty-one
        of the cousins to respond in the last number. These are pleasant
        reminders which help to make us thankful for life's joys and for Time's
        golden memories which are good and sweet. But I am reminded that sorrow
        has come into the homes and hearts of some of our circle, and taken from
        us those we loved. Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1102">Andrew
          Owlett</a>, with only a few minutes warning, was called away, and we
        mourned with those to whom he was very dear. Then in December our hearts
        went out to Cousin <a href="TubbsAnn1855.html">Ann VanDusen</a> who
        buried her <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1414">darling
          boy</a>, and we stood by, powerless to comfort her. Then a message
        came to us of another whom to know was to love - Cousin <a href="CraneJennie1852.html">Jennie
          Bosard</a> - and we paused and asked for light to have courage amid
        the tempests of the changing years. We miss them all, and our sympathy
        goes out to the members of their households. </p>
      <p> You will note by my letter that we are living in St. Petersburg,
        Florida. As our "Honorable Officers" ask for personal news especially, I
        am very glad to tell you of the delightful time we are having here. We
        came the last of November, 1924, responding to the most cordial
        invitation from <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a> and <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">Frank</a>
        when they visited us in the summer; and we have enjoyed all the comforts
        and generous hospitality of their "sunny southern home" during the
        severe winter months of our dear old state of Pennsylvania. The outlook
        was too alluring to resist - knowing as we did the wonderful climate in
        Florida and the pleasure of being near them. (We spent the winter of
        1920 here). </p>

    <div class="Message">
      <p> So we migrated with the birds and have enjoyed perfect summer weather
        with an abundance of flowers and fruits, open air concerts, lectures,
        air-dome movies, and the finest churches with ministers who have master
        minds, and choirs above the average. Then, too, it has been a great
        privilege to be near Tommie and Frank and their children and families.
        Then to add to our pleasure <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Cousin Ed</a>
        and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I940">Emma
          Congdon</a> of Tacoma, Washington came for three months. They rented a
        pleasant apartment, and I can not tell you what a joy it was to us to
        have them here. They are true to the "faith of our fathers". Many very
        happy hours we spent together in the parks or in their apartment, and
        they were among the first ones to "break bread" with us in our new home.</p>
      <p> Oh, yes, we have a home of our own here now. Through the brotherly
        advice of Tommie we purchased a lot here when we first came, thinking
        some time perhaps we would build a small bungalow and occasionally spend
        a winter in this "Sunshine City" - for it is really wonderful here, and
        the climate seems to put a new meaning into His promises, and a new
        meaning into His glorious sunshine and His smiling stars and "sunny
        southern moon".</p>
      <p> So we said, "Hats off to the past" - and "coats off to the future"
        (for it is hot here) - and again, with Tommie to advise, we began to
        plan to build us a home - a home which is now completed and into which
        we moved on March 14, 1925. At present we are very busy improving the
        grounds and putting in tropical shrubbery and citrus fruits. We have a
        southern exposure, and are so near the Gulf of Mexico that both night
        and day are as perfect as you could desire. We have both enjoyed perfect
        health since coming here. But for the great distance between us and our
        loved ones<sup>1</sup>, we should feel "settled for life".</p>
      <p> However, we expect to go North early in May - as our house in
        Westfield has been closed during our stay here. We have not lost
        interest in the home-folk, especially those of our own kin. We are so
        happy to know that sister <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">Mary</a> is
        much improved in health, and sincerely hope it may be permanent. It was
        a great pleasure last summer to have a visit from brother <a href="CampbellWilliam1864.html">Will</a>
        and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I905">Louise</a>
        and Tommie and Frank, and together we made a pilgrimage to the home of
        our childhood in Farmington <span class="Annotation">[Twp.]</span> and
        lived over again in memory many pleasant events, long past, but not
        forgotten. Sister Mary was too ill to go, but I trust when they come
        this summer that she, too, will be able to make the party complete by
        her presence.</p>

      <div>It was not our privilege to attend the Annual Cousins Dinner at the
        pleasant home of Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie</a>
        and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I961">Anna
          Congdon</a>. We regretted this very much , knowing as we do the
        warm-hearted hospitality of these big-hearted cousins. We were certainly
        glad to hear from those present that a goodly number was there and all
        enjoyed a glorious good time.</div>
      <p> As far as I know, our children are well - but, oh, so far away!</p>
      <p> Before I close I must congratulate our new "Official Board" on the
        honor conferred upon them. While we very reluctantly give up the
        retiring officers - with many thanks for their efficient services - we
        welcome in the new, promising our hearty cooperation.</p>
      <p> With best love to each and every one,</p>
