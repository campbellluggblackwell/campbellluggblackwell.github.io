            memoir was given to us by Mary's nephew, Roger Rhodes Hughey, who
            came from Tacoma, WA to several of our reunions. Thank you Roger for
            sharing it with us. In turning the document into webpages, I have
            tried to preserve the original look and feel wherever practical, but
            have made changes to the format as needed, to have the pages be
            responsive to the size and shape of the device they are being read
            on. Many formatting options are available on web pages that are not
            available in a typewritten manuscript -- occasionally I have utilize
            the web capabilities if it makes the content clearer to the reader.
            And, of course, added links and endnotes for those readers not
            familiar with those people, places and times.<br>
            The original document was 31 typewriter pages long. I saw no reason
            to preserve the original pagination, so I have made the memoir a
            single webpage.<br>
            <br>
            So as not to interfere with the story's "flow" for those who don't
            want to be distracted by commentary on history, I placed my comments
            as <b>footnotes</b> (in this case, <b> endnotes</b>). BUT, for
            those who do want to interrupt the flow to read the foot/endnotes, I
            have turned the foot/endnote numbers into links.&nbsp; If you click
            on an endnote number's link, it will take you directly to the note
            -- No scrolling needed. To return to where you were reading, click
            on the <b>back arrow</b> at the top left corner of your screen. [I
            haven't yet implemented that. Nor fleshed out the endnotes]-- wbt]</blockquote>

          <div class="w3-container w3-cursive" style="font-family: 'Great Vibes', cursive;">
            <p>Perhaps there is no particular reason why I should record my life
              except that so much of it has seemed highly interesting to me and
              I have enjoyed it. As I look back, I can see so clearly how
              certain incidents and experiences were so powerful in preparing me
              for much that was to follow.</p>
            <p>Being a highly sensitive child I was often quick to be impressed
              by some incidents that were never considered of great importance
              by anyone else and not at all intended to particularly affect me,
              but which nevertheless did. As such events come to mind, I shall
              record them. Perhaps my narrative will not always be in
              chronological order.</p>
            <p>If other eyes than mine should ever read these words, I trust
              they will be charitable and not look for literary merit or
              purposeful construction. I am impelled by no motive other than to
              <u>write</u>. </p>
            <p><b><u>Dec. 30, 1991.</u></b> When did I begin to write my story?
              I'm not certain. Perhaps it was in my 80s, so I shall put down
              September 30, 1985 as a possible date for when I took up my pen
              and wrote the first words of this, "The Story of My Life."</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-container w3-serif">
          <p>According to a letter written by my <a href="HugheyHerbert1857.html">
              father</a>, Sept. 23, 1899 I was born three days previous, Sept.
            20th, 1899, on a Wednesday at 11 o'clock at night and I weighed 8
            lbs 11 oz. I was born on the old home farm in Long Lake Township,
            Crow Wing County, Minnesota, about six miles from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainerd,_Minnesota">Brainerd</a>.
          </p>
          <p>After scrutinizing me for three days, my father had decided that my
            skin was fair and my eyes were blue. Perhaps he had the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday%27s_Child">rhyme</a>
            mixed in his mind and credited Wednesday's child with fairness or
            perhaps he was one of gentlemen who really prefer blondes. </p>
          <blockquote style="padding-left:10%;">"Monday's child is fair of face<br>
            Tuesday's child is full of grace<br>
            Wednesday's child is full of woe,<br>
            Thursday's child works hard for a living<br>
            But the child that's born on the Sabbath day<br>
            Is happy and blithesome, loving and gay."</blockquote>
          <p>At any rate, I soon belied his words by absorbing so much of the
            tawniness that sun and exposure bestowed that I could scarcely be
            rated fair, and my eyes turned a fairly dark brown, rimmed by rather
            long brown lashes. They must have been the must have been the most
            attractive part of my face, for I do not recall anyone ever ever
            saying that I was a pretty child, but often, though they would look
            again at my eyes and make some remark about them. Those remarks
            ceased when I covered my eyes with spectacles at the age of </p>
          <p>Our house was not beautiful. At the time of my birth, it needed new
            siding and painting and likely re-shingling. A picture I have of my
            <a href="BixbyHannah1863.html">mother</a> and me, taken when I was a
            year or less, shows the weather beaten old house with a rough board
            shed built onto the west. That old shed had a great fascination for
            me as a child. Boxes of old clothes afforded me costumes to dress up
            in. Hazelnuts and butternuts were kept in cans out there and I could
            help myself and as long as the supply lasted. The Old magazines
            accumulated there and contained much to interest me. Many of my most
            treasured paper dolls came from their pages. Old copies of the
            "Youth's Companion" were read and reread. I was truly sorry when the
            homely old shed was torn down, to be supplanted by a "west bedroom."</p>
          <p>I suppose it was a bit of the regret that I felt with its passing
            that made me put it into a little poem which I wrote when I studied
            composition under <a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#RogerSergel">Roger
              Sergel</a>, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_State_University_Moorhead">Moorehead
              State Teachers College</a> in 1922. Here's the poem:</p>
          <blockquote style="padding-left:10%;"> "There's a black cloud in the
            west,<br>
            Big drops begin to fall,<br>
            The wind has whipped a board<br>
            From off our shed.<br>
            The hens go by with huddled wings.<br>
            Grandma looks anxious,<br>
            But Grandpa, reassured, looks overhead,<br>
            "Just a mere squall, the clouds are partin',<br>
            Shet that south winder," was all he said. </blockquote>
          <p>The picture of mother and me shows the rain barrels in the corner.
            We always had them with long boards which had to be arranged <u>just
              so,</u> at every shower, to catch the drip from the eves, for we
            never had eave spouts.</p>
          <p>In rainy seasons we could be more lavish with the precious "soft
            water" for "washing up" in the morning. This was a luxury, for our
            well water was very hard, and soap would curdle it and cause our
            skins to feel gummy. It also aggravated a grimy ring on the wash
            basin, which became my job to scour off.</p>
          <p>When there was plenty of soft water in the barrels, one would go
            out with the big gray enameled dipper and dip it up, full slightly
            yellow water, maybe from the roof shingles or from the barrels, I
            don't know. I remember it as having a yellowish cast, and with a
            soft water smell. That was one of the smells I liked and cherish.
            The lake water smelled similarly. with the addition of the smell of
            rushes. So did the cistern water which we had down at the "shop" in
            the cistern. The water in the barrels often had wrigglers in it.
            Little patches of gray mosquito eggs appeared on the water, from
            time to time and no one thought to watch and destroy them before the
            wrigglers hatched--to soon become mosquitoes.</p>
          <p>Once I attempted to teach some kittens to swim in the rain barrels
            and I received a lecture from my father who forbad my ever trying
            that again. A few years later, I was truly horrified when an orphan
            boy who lived with us for awhile, tried the same stunt in the lake.
            He had taken my baby <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Peterson-6107">niece</a>
            along for an audience. She could not have been more than about three
            years of age. They had gone out in the boat and he had thrown the
            kittens into the water, from the boat. When the frightened creatures
            would try to reach the boat and scramble in, Walter would push them
            back with the oar. Whether Irma cried and attracted my father or
            what, I don't know, but he appeared on the scene, and doubtless,
            Walter got the same lecture I had gotten.</p>
          <p>The old picture of mother and me shows a grape basket hanging near
            the eaves at the back door. I can't say "on the porch" for we never
            gave the back entrance so fancy a name. It was the "stoop" and
            "stoop" it remained for many years. No one needs to tell me what was
            in that basket. I'm positive it was clothes pins, for she kept it
            hanging on the stoop where she would grab it on the way to or from
            the clothes line.</p>
          <p>The "stoop" was nothing of beauty, but it boasted one thing of
            which my mother was proud. The little steps at the end were made by
            my brother <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hughey-1584">Edd</a>
            and my mother thought he showed much skill for a boy. I doubt if the
            steps which show in my picture are the ones that Edd made, for my
            memory tells me they were likes stair steps which these in the
            picture are more like a slanting ladder with steps instead of rungs.</p>
          <p>We children lost a few treasures in the cracks between the floor
            boards of the old stoop. Marbles rolled through and evaded our
            reach. When the stoop was torn up and a small back porch was built
            in its place, I remember watching eagerly to see if I could spot any
            of our lost treasures, but I do not recall finding anything.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/wildflowers/common-knotgrass">Knot
              grass</a> covered the back yard, except where the wash water had
            been thrown and where the paths were made. </p>
          <p>Our house had only four rooms until we built on the west bedroom.
            The kitchen was the most used room. Everyone came to its door.
            Family and company alike ate around the large table. Many a time I
            hurried across the field, coming home from school with a hungry
            eagerness to see what mother had been baking. "Riz biscuits," best
            of all, when flavored with cinnamon and sugar. They were the chief
            delight. Hot, covered with sweet fresh homemade butter. I can't tell
            you how good they tasted! I've often tried to make biscuits like
            them, but they never seem the same. Maybe the butter helped make a
            difference. Mom won the prize year after year at the county fair
            with her butter--butter that always took <u>first place</u> no
            matter how much competition she had. </p>
          <p>Mother and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Emner-3">her
              mother</a> before her were the greatest cooks in the world! No
            cooking school turns out better ones. Never will I forget the family
            occasions when we gathered at Grandmother's to enjoy such a variety
            and quality of food as would put any expensive meal I ever ate in a
            hotel to shame.</p>
          <p>There was a pantry off our kitchen. Sometimes we called it a
            "buttery." (I think Grandma Bixby always did.) There the food was
            kept and on the highest shelves the best dishes were stored, also,
            on one shelf the medicines for man and beast were kept.</p>
          <p>The cookie jar was a large stone crock which was always within easy
            reach and never hidden. We children were never refused cookies for
            lunch, as long as they lasted. Neighbor children, too, knew how good
            mother's molasses cookies were. Nor were those cookies the dainty,
            tea table variety. They were big, round, thick, cookies, worthy of
            the name, sometimes iced with a boiled white icing, made by beating
            hot syrup into the beaten whites of eggs. </p>
          <p>Mother's recipe for the cookies called for:</p>
          <table class="w3-table">

          <p>Many of those cookies topped the lunch we carried in our buckets to
            school, and sometimes Mother tuckedd in an extra one for us to give
            to the best chum, or to "swap" for a bit of Swedish or Norwegian
            cookery.</p>
          <p>About half of our community were Scandinavians: Swedish, Norwegian
            or Danish. My father called them all "Swedes" and despised their
            foreign ways. It irked him to hear them exchange their "j's" for
            "y's" and he blamed them for all the lack of progress our community
            might suffer. Local politics made semi-feuds of every school meeting
            when one faction, led by my father, voted for "nine months of school
            and higher taxes," while the others thriftily considered the value
            of a little extra help at planting and harvesting time, so voted
            stubbornly for eight months and a lower school tax.</p>
          <p>Dad had some boon companions, among the Danes particularly,
            however. "Sam Hansen" and Dad would meet on the street corner every
            week in Brainerd and talk for hours until both families would wonder
            if they were ever coming home. They did not go into saloons or pool
            halls. They simply <u>met,</u> perhaps at O'Briens Grocery, and
            talked offer the township, state and nation. It never occurred to
            them to visit one another when in the country. "Going to town"
            seemed to provide the opportunity and an excuse to loaf. Saturday
            was usually was farmers' day in town. Horses were tied to hitching
            posts or, if the weather was bad and the stay long, "put up" in
            Purdy's Livery Stable. I believe it was Purdy's. At least I know it
            was Mr. Purdy who admired our matched team of grays and would
            willingly have bought them for his livery.</p>
          <p>My earliest memory is of the time when <a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
              href="#UncleGeorge">Aunt Minnie and Uncle George Hepperly</a> came
            to visit us. I remember the day. Aunt Minnie took my picture with
            her big <a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#PlateCamera">plate
              camera</a>. Water lilies and other wildflowers made a background
            and I was posed in various ways.</p>
          <p>I took smallpox while they were there, as did Uncle George, and,
            when convalescing days might have dragged tediously, they were
            shortened and made more pleasant for me by Uncle George cuddling me
            in the old hammock out under the pines. There, somewhat shunned by
            others, we comforted and amused one another. I was about 1 1/2 years
            old, but I do have a few vivid recollections of some things, which
            though trivial, perhaps, for some reason impressed me and so have
            loomed large in my memory. I remember crying the day Aunt Minnie and
            Uncle George left us to go back to their home in Salt Lake City.</p>
          <p>I remember the day I was vaccinated a few. months later, and it
            didn't "take" for I had <u>had</u> smallpox. I remember the doctor
            pinched my toe and remarked about my button shoes which had red
            stitching for trimming.</p>
          <p>I think I have one recollection, which antedates these, but I
            hesitate to tell it for my brothers would always whoop in scornful
            glee of my insistence that I <u>do</u> remember when I used the
            teacher's combination hot water bottle and enema bag for a sled and
            came dragging it out into the living room to the consternation of
            everyone present. Also the quick, but horrified action of my mother,
            who bundled me back into the bedroom "in a hurry." I think the
            teacher was Lydia Neighnabour (or Neighnaubor) (<a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hughey-1582">Carrie</a>
            wrote this for my information) as we called her. I can't spell her
            name.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#TeacherRoomBoard"></a></p>
          <p>Mother made for me a beautiful little soft, bright, red cashmere
            dress when I was three. It had a lace yoke edged with gold braid and
            it had a big soft red satin sash. I wore it to Grandma Bixby's one
            day and stood too close to the big round heater. The pungent smell
            of scorched wool made someone whirl me around, but not soon enough
            to save my dress which was burned all across the back of the skirt.
            That dress is the one I wore when our family group picture was made.<a
              aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#HugheyGroupPhoto"></a> How
            I delayed things that day by not keeping my hand on father's knee,
            as was posed! The photographer would no sooner get under his black
            cape than down would come my hand. <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hughey-1587">Harry</a>
            had to stand on a box to be seen properly, but he stood very
            straight and obedient, with his shiny celluloid collar and knee
            pants. The photographer finally gave up and let me rest my hand on
            Mamma's knee, where it was more at home anyway. </p>
          <p>Father was always kind to me, but I never felt at ease with him
            when I was a little child. He liked to tease and was unpredictable.
            He thought it was good fun to rub his scratchy chin whiskers against
            my face and I hated it so, I avoided him. What a lot of fun and
            companionship we missed because I endeavored to keep a safe distance
            from him. He was a great reader and I soon learned that he did not
            like to be bothered when he read. I never really got acquainted with
            my father until my senior year in high school when he was in Montana
            with my brother Edd. That year and the ones following while he was
            on the claim, I cherished for the correspondence we carried on.
            experience. </p>
          Those letters revealed my father to me in ways which were a precious
          <p>There is one childhood remembrance of Dad, which I'd like to
            relate. The Christmas I turned was four, Santa Claus came to our
            house in a "big way." Papa (that's what he liked me to call him)mp
            took me in the kitchen Christmas Eve and turned down the lamp.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
              href="#KeroseneLamp"></a> Then he and I sat in the corner and he
            held me there in his arms while telling me to be just as quiet as I
            could be, so Santa wouldn't hear me. It wasn't long before we heard
            bells, sleigh bells, coming on the road! Nearer they came and
            louder, and soon we heard noises on the roof, that to my childish
            ears were nothing else than the traditional pawing of reindeer's
            hoofs. Voices in the living room were interpreted to me by my father
            to be Santa Claus and Mamma in conversation. In a little while, the
            bell went down the road again and Mamma opened the door between the
            kitchen and living room and said we could come in -- that Santa had
            been there and was gone.</p>
          <p>We went in and there was the most beautiful tree we ever had. But
            at first. I hardly saw the tree, for there on one of the lower
            branches, with outstretched arms toward me was Julia, beautiful
            Julia, with rer thick brown curls of real hair and eyes that would
            go to sleep. Julia, in a brown wool suspender dress, a white blouse,
            full petticoat wnceith embroidered flounce, under pants that
            buttoned around the waist, as did the petticoat, just like a real
            lady's, trimmed with rows of fine tucking on each leg. Also, an
            under-shirt or vest that buttoned down the back. Her clothes were as
            carefully made, and as stylish, as one could wish. Julia also had a
            beautiful wool cap or "tam o'shanter" crocheted of red woolen yarn.
            On the back of her neck was the name <a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
              href="#Floradora">"Floradora</a>, which I couldn't ignore, so I
            gave that to her as a second name, but Julia was her <u>first</u>
            name, after a city girl I admired; Julia Wilson, my idol, the
            daughter of the County Superintendent of Schools for Crow Wing
            County.<sup>8</sup> I kept Julia carefully until I was past 40, then
            I had mother's switch<sup>9</sup> made into a wig for her and gave
            her to Donna Mae.<sup>10</sup> Later, I got her back again to keep.
            At present, Julia is with the Museum in Port Townsend.</p>
