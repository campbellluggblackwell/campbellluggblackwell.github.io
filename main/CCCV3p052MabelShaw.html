        Dear Cousins All:
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        It hardly seems that another year has passed since we wrote our last
        letters. To some it has been a year which has brought sorrow and we
        wish to express our deep sympathy with those cousins who have lost
        loved ones.
      </p>
<p>
        We are about as we were one year ago, and are very glad to say that my
        <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">mother</a>, who has been very ill,
        during the past year, is much better and able to come down stairs
        several times each week, and to out in a car. <span wc_id="I777">
        Wilford</span> attended a school of Embalming and Sanitary Science in
        Philadelphia and is now a licensed mortician, which relieves <span wc_id="I773">
        Llewellyn</span> of much responsibility. <span wc_id="I780">
        Helen</span> is very busy with thirty music pupils, two orchestras,
        playing the pipe organ in church, and keeping young with her two boys.
        <span wc_id="I783">
        Richard</span> is six feet tall, is in high school and is a patrol -leader
        in his Boy Scout troop. We have a great deal of music as all three of
        the boys are musical. Wilford sings, Richard plays the drums, etc. and
        <span wc_id="I785">
        George Robert</span> plays several instruments, his favorite being the
        clarinet and ukelele. The boys play in Helen's orchestra and the high
        school orchestra, and last week, much to his delight, George Robert was
        asked to play in the Normal band<sup>1</sup>.
      </p>
<p>
        Perhaps it might be interesting to those who have thought that sometime
        they would like to cross the continent, to hear about the auto trip
        which we took last summer. The plans, preparations, and anticipation of
        such a trip are a very real part of the trip itself. We began these in
        the winter by writing for maps, catalogues of camping outfits and
        booklets of the national highways, parks, etc. These Llewellyn studied
        for weeks. Our outfit consisted of a new <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehenryford/6767066343/lightbox/">Essex
        coach</a>, a "Shilling Camping Outfit" with splendid bed and tent which
        folded and strapped on one running board, three army packing bags in
        the back seat, and a kitchenette on the other running board. We could
        open both car doors.
      </p>
<p>
        We left home June second, at nine o'clock, and camped our first night
        twelve miles this side of Niagara Falls in a lovely apple orchard which
        was in full bloom. The weather was fine. The next day, after spending a
        short time at the Falls, we drove through Canada on the Governors
        Road<sup>2</sup>. We saw wonderful old English estates, and thought of
        my <span wc_id="I771">
        father</span> as we drove through Hamilton, his birthplace. That night it
        was raining, so we decided to stay at an old Canadian Inn, where we had
        stayed twice before.
      </p>

        1. When I first read this, I assumed she was referring to the college
        band, which would have been unusual for a 13 yr. old. But then I
        remembered that the college operated a school where the normal's
        students could do their practice teaching.

<p>
        At four-thirty on June fourth we arrived at Saginaw, Michigan, and
        spent the night with <span wc_id="I101">
        "Little Joe" Campbell</span>'s daughter, <span wc_id="I1889">
        Nina Knuttle</span>, leaving the next morning. <span wc_id="I1890">
        Nina's husband</span> has a splendid meat business. That afternoon we
        arrived at Llewellyn's sister's home in Cadillac, Michigan. On June
        ninth we left Cadillac in the afternoon and camped at Frankfort, and
        the next day crosses Lake Michigan to Marinette, Wisconsin, where we
        visited Uncle <a href="CampbellWilliam1864.html">Will Campbell</a> and
        Family until the morning of June thirteenth. Uncle Will is in the coal
        business, and has a dock all his own where ships of coal land. They
        have the monopoly of the coal, cement, building and paving material
        business of that section. Their dock has mountains of coal piled ready
        for delivery. While there we were royally entertained at the various
        clubs to which the family belongs.
      </p>
<p>
        After leaving Uncle Will's we camped at St. Paul for over Sunday,
        crossed the Mississippi River<sup>3</sup>, followed the Yellowstone
        Trail, passed the great corn, wheat and alfalfa fields which seemed
        miles long, and entered South Dakota at Big Stone. Here, to our
        surprise, in exchange for our paper money we began to get our pockets
        filled with silver dollars which the Westerners seem to like best.
      </p>
<p>
        June twentieth we camped at Bowman, North Dakota, stayed over Sunday at
        Billings, Montana, and Monday night camped at Lake Junction,
        twenty-seven miles in the Yellowstone Park, by the east or Cody
        entrance and Shoshone Dam. This was a dangerous road<sup>4</sup>. We
        spent several days in the park, driving over every road, and going to
        the north or main entrance and out of the park at the west entrance.
        The wonderful natural features of the Yellowstone Park are beyond
        description.
      </p>
<p>
        The next week-end we spent in Salt Lake City, and heard the wonderful
        pipe organ recital in the tabernacle which seats ten thousand people.
        The compound of ten acres is surrounded by a high wall within which is
        the temple and various other imposing buildings connected with the
        administration of this great deluded sect of people<sup>5</sup>. On
        June thirtieth, we drove back to Pocaletta <span class="Annotaton">[sic]</span> and camped that night at Buhl, Idaho. Here, by
        chance, we met a minister and family who, in the course of the
        conversation, and much to our amazement, informed us that he was on his
        way to Mansfield, Pennsylvania, to visit a college friend of his. This
        proved to be the Baptist minister, one of our nearest neighbors.
      </p>
<p>
        After following the Old Oregon Trail we reached Baker, Oregon, on July
        second, and spent a delightful week with Cousin <span wc_id="I822">
        Harry Horton</span> and family. Harry is the leading dentist in Baker, and
        has a fine office in the center of the city, a lovely home and many
        fine friends whom we enjoyed meeting.
      </p>
</div>

<p>
        3. I'm surprised that Mabel didn't go through Brainerd, and visit the
        Hugheys, whom she would have known of from Volumes 1 &amp; 2. Perhaps
        they felt it was too far North, or they were feeling squeezed for time.
        However, they did visit Edd Hughey in WA.
      </p>
<p>
        4. I believe her. I've seen photos of some of those old roads.
      </p>
<p>
        5. Even though some readers may find Mabel's comments about the Church
        of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints (Mormons) offensive, I felt it
        was important for historical accuracy to include them exactly as
        originally written.

        For scenery the Columbia Highway beats them all. After traveling over
        this road from Baker and stopping at Pendleton where the famous annual
        round-up is held, we arrived in Independence, Oregon, the home of
        Cousins <span wc_id="I815">
        Nellie Horton</span> Kimball and <span wc_id="I828">
        Arthur Horton</span> on July eleventh. The next day Nellie had a regular
        Campbell Cousins Dinner to celebrate our twenty-fifth wedding
        anniversary. <span wc_id="I790">
        Frank</span> and Arthur and family were there. Nellie and <span wc_id="I816">
        Clark</span> were married twenty-seven years the fifteenth, so it was a
        double celebration.
      </p>
<p>
        Clark is the city editor, and we receive and enjoy his paper regularly,
        more than ever after meeting and being entertained by many friends of
        the Horton's and Kimballs with whose names we are now familiar.
        Probably Nellie will never tell you that her daughter, <span wc_id="I820">
        Faith</span><sup>6</sup>, was the youngest student out of several thousand
        to enter the University of Oregon. Arthur has a fine family, a splendid
        home and hardware business. While we were there Llewellyn went out with
        him to deliver several machines as large as some of the houses we saw
        on our trip. While in Independence we all drove ninety-seven miles to
        the Pacific Coast and spent several days digging clams, bathing in the
        ocean, etc.
      </p>
<p>
        On July twenty-eighth we left for Tacoma, Washington, arriving at
        <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Cousin Ed</a> and <a href="VaughanEmma1854.html">Em Congdon</a>'s, and enjoyed a shore dinner at
        the fine house of Cousin <span wc_id="I947">
        Lee Congdon</span>. The next day we drove around the city and called at
        the home of <span wc_id="I1222">
        Edgar Hughey</span>. On July thirtieth we drove seventy-five miles to Mt.
        Ranier National Park and walked about eight miles on the ruin of the
        Nisqually Glacier. In two of those miles we made an elevation of two
        thousand feet.
      </p>
<p>
        On July thirtieth we left Tacoma, taking Cousin Ed and Em with us, and
        drove to Seattle where we took the boat, and crossed Puget Sound to the
        home of Cousin <span wc_id="I941">
        Georgia Congdon</span> Parks, ate a fine chicken dinner, enjoyed the
        wonderful view and beautiful flowers, and left the next morning for
        Portland, the home of Cousin Frank Horton and family. Frank is in
        business there and is prospering. He had just bought a new grocery
        store when we were there. While we were there we saw many of our home
        friends who live in this beautiful city. We spent a pleasant hour with
        Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charles
        Congdon</a><sup>7</sup>.
      </p>
<p>
        We returned to Independence on August fifth and spent several more days
        with the Hortons and the Kimballs. After shedding some of the
        characteristic Campbell tears, we left on August twelfth for our
        homeward trip. We visited Crater Lake, and saw Mt. Shasta for one
        hundred seventy-one miles.

        6. Faith continues to be remarkable, becoming the first woman dean at
        the U. of Oregon. And, as of this footnote's writing (July, 2013),
        continues to be remarkable. She is both the only surviving writer of a
        CCC letter (Vol. 3 pp96-97), and she also is the oldest living member
        of our "clan".

        7. Charlie lived in NYC. He may have been visiting Portland on
        business.

        When one travels over this great, accordian <span class="Annotqtion">[sic]</span> plaited country, it makes one feel very small
        indeed, and yet we are not as small as a sparrow. We visited the
        Yosemite Valley and traveled over some of the most dangerous roads in
        this gold mining country. The big trees of the Sequoia Forest were a
        wonder to us.
      </p>
<p>
        It was very hot through California and Arizona, especially over the
        Mohave Desert. We traveled over the Old Trails Road, the Santa Fe Route
        and Park to Park Highway. We visited the Grand Canyon of the Colorado,
        and as has been truly said, it is the most "sublime spectacle in the
        world". We camped at the Cliff Dwellings, visited the Presbyterian
        Mission School at Albuquerque, and the oldest church in America at
        Santa Fe, New Mexico. The Indians in their native dress, their homes,
        their pottery and all were very interesting to us.
      </p>
<p>
        On August thirtieth we left Bucklin, Missouri, and drove on a very
        rough, roller coaster road, passing through Hamilton, Missouri, the
        birthplace of Mark Twain, crossed the Mississippi and and Illinois
        Rivers and camped at Spring-field, Illinois, where we saw the homestead
        of Abraham Lincoln. We came on home through Indiana, Ohio and West
        Virginia, driving about one thousand twenty seven miles in the last
        four days. We arrived home on September fourth, after having driven ten
        thousand two hundred twenty-five miles on the whole trip<sup>8</sup>.
        We have a fine collection of pictures which we hope you all may enjoy
        when you visit us.
      </p>
<p>
        I have already written far too long a letter, but I only wish that time
        and space would permit me to go more into detail about our trip, the
        grandeur of the five national parks which we visited, the wonderful
        time we had with our relatives and how prosperous they all are, their
        lovely homes and how much they all did for our pleasure. It is like a
        dream now, and a three months which we shall never forget. It is worth
        every effort one can possibly put forth to take this trip, and there is
        no way to travel which can equal traveling by auto.
      </p>
<p>
        The family join with me in sending love and best wishes to all.

        8. Considering what roads and cars were like in 1925, this was an
        amazing trip. I suspect very few people had made one like it.
