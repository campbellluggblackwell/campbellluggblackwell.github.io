    <div class="Salutation">
      <p>Dear Cousins All:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> It hardly seems that another year has passed since we wrote our last
        letters. To some it has been a year which has brought sorrow and we wish
        to express our deep sympathy with those cousins who have lost loved
        ones. </p>
      <p> We are about as we were one year ago, and are very glad to say that my
        <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">mother</a>, who has been very ill,
        during the past year, is much better and able to come down stairs
        several times each week, and to out in a car. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I777">Wilford</a>
        attended a school of Embalming and Sanitary Science in Philadelphia and
        is now a licensed mortician, which relieves <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I773">Llewellyn</a>
        of much responsibility. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I780">Helen</a>
        is very busy with thirty music pupils, two orchestras, playing the pipe
        organ in church, and keeping young with her two boys. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I783">Richard</a>
        is six feet tall, is in high school and is a patrol -leader in his Boy
        Scout troop. We have a great deal of music as all three of the boys are
        musical. Wilford sings, Richard plays the drums, etc. and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I785">George
          Robert</a> plays several instruments, his favorite being the clarinet
        and ukelele. The boys play in Helen's orchestra and the high school
        orchestra, and last week, much to his delight, George Robert was asked
        to play in the Normal band<sup>1</sup>. </p>
      <p> Perhaps it might be interesting to those who have thought that
        sometime they would like to cross the continent, to hear about the auto
        trip which we took last summer. The plans, preparations, and
        anticipation of such a trip are a very real part of the trip itself. We
        began these in the winter by writing for maps, catalogues of camping
        outfits and booklets of the national highways, parks, etc. These
        Llewellyn studied for weeks. Our outfit consisted of a new <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehenryford/6767066343/lightbox/">Essex
          coach</a>, a "Shilling Camping Outfit" with splendid bed and tent
        which folded and strapped on one running board, three army packing bags
        in the back seat, and a kitchenette on the other running board. We could
        open both car doors. </p>
      <p> We left home June second, at nine o'clock, and camped our first night
        twelve miles this side of Niagara Falls in a lovely apple orchard which
        was in full bloom. The weather was fine. The next day, after spending a
        short time at the Falls, we drove through Canada on the Governors Road<sup>2</sup>.
        We saw wonderful old English estates, and thought of my <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I771">father</a>
        as we drove through Hamilton, his birthplace. That night it was raining,
        so we decided to stay at an old Canadian Inn, where we had stayed twice
        before.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>1. When I first read this, I assumed she was referring to the college
        band, which would have been unusual for a 13 yr. old. But then I
        remembered that the college operated a school where the normal's
        students could do their practice teaching.</p>
      <p>2 This was King's Highway 2 --- now replaced by Highway 401.</p>

      <p> At four-thirty on June fourth we arrived at Saginaw, Michigan, and
        spent the night with <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I101">"Little
          Joe" Campbell</a>'s daughter, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1889">Nina
          Knuttle</a>, leaving the next morning. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1890">Nina's
          husband</a> has a splendid meat business. That afternoon we arrived at
        Llewellyn's sister's home in Cadillac, Michigan. On June ninth we left
        Cadillac in the afternoon and camped at Frankfort, and the next day
        crosses Lake Michigan to Marinette, Wisconsin, where we visited Uncle <a
          href="CampbellWilliam1864.html">Will Campbell</a> and Family until the
        morning of June thirteenth. Uncle Will is in the coal business, and has
        a dock all his own where ships of coal land. They have the monopoly of
        the coal, cement, building and paving material business of that section.
        Their dock has mountains of coal piled ready for delivery. While there
        we were royally entertained at the various clubs to which the family
        belongs.</p>
      <p> After leaving Uncle Will's we camped at St. Paul for over Sunday,
        crossed the Mississippi River<sup>3</sup>, followed the Yellowstone
        Trail, passed the great corn, wheat and alfalfa fields which seemed
        miles long, and entered South Dakota at Big Stone. Here, to our
        surprise, in exchange for our paper money we began to get our pockets
        filled with silver dollars which the Westerners seem to like best.</p>
      <p>June twentieth we camped at Bowman, North Dakota, stayed over Sunday at
        Billings, Montana, and Monday night camped at Lake Junction,
        twenty-seven miles in the Yellowstone Park, by the east or Cody entrance
        and Shoshone Dam. This was a dangerous road<sup>4</sup>. We spent
        several days in the park, driving over every road, and going to the
        north or main entrance and out of the park at the west entrance. The
        wonderful natural features of the Yellowstone Park are beyond
        description.</p>
      <p>The next week-end we spent in Salt Lake City, and heard the wonderful
        pipe organ recital in the tabernacle which seats ten thousand people.
        The compound of ten acres is surrounded by a high wall within which is
        the temple and various other imposing buildings connected with the
        administration of this great deluded sect of people<sup>5</sup>. On June
        thirtieth, we drove back to Pocaletta <span class="Annotaton">[sic]</span>
        and camped that night at Buhl, Idaho. Here, by chance, we met a minister
        and family who, in the course of the conversation, and much to our
        amazement, informed us that he was on his way to Mansfield,
        Pennsylvania, to visit a college friend of his. This proved to be the
        Baptist minister, one of our nearest neighbors.</p>
      <p> After following the Old Oregon Trail we reached Baker, Oregon, on July
        second, and spent a delightful week with Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I822">Harry
          Horton</a> and family. Harry is the leading dentist in Baker, and has
        a fine office in the center of the city, a lovely home and many fine
        friends whom we enjoyed meeting.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>3. I'm surprised that Mabel didn't go through Brainerd, and visit the
        Hugheys, whom she would have known of from Volumes 1 &amp; 2. Perhaps
        they felt it was too far North, or they were feeling squeezed for time.
        However, they did visit Edd Hughey in WA.</p>
      <p>4. I believe her. I've seen photos of some of those old roads.</p>
      <p>5. Even though some readers may find Mabel's comments about the Church
        of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints (Mormons) offensive, I felt it
        was important for historical accuracy to include them exactly as
        originally written.</p>

      <p> For scenery the Columbia Highway beats them all. After traveling over
        this road from Baker and stopping at Pendleton where the famous annual
        round-up is held, we arrived in Independence, Oregon, the home of
        Cousins <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I815">Nellie
          Horton</a> Kimball and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I828">Arthur
          Horton</a> on July eleventh. The next day Nellie had a regular
        Campbell Cousins Dinner to celebrate our twenty-fifth wedding
        anniversary. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I790">Frank</a>
        and Arthur and family were there. Nellie and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I816">Clark</a>
        were married twenty-seven years the fifteenth, so it was a double
        celebration.</p>
      <p> Clark is the city editor, and we receive and enjoy his paper
        regularly, more than ever after meeting and being entertained by many
        friends of the Horton's and Kimballs with whose names we are now
        familiar. Probably Nellie will never tell you that her daughter, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I820">Faith</a><sup>6</sup>,
        was the youngest student out of several thousand to enter the University
        of Oregon. Arthur has a fine family, a splendid home and hardware
        business. While we were there Llewellyn went out with him to deliver
        several machines as large as some of the houses we saw on our trip.
        While in Independence we all drove ninety-seven miles to the Pacific
        Coast and spent several days digging clams, bathing in the ocean, etc.</p>
      <p> On July twenty-eighth we left for Tacoma, Washington, arriving at <a
          href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Cousin Ed</a> and <a href="VaughanEmma1854.html">Em
          Congdon</a>'s, and enjoyed a shore dinner at the fine house of Cousin
        <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I947">Lee
          Congdon</a>. The next day we drove around the city and called at the
        home of <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1222">Edgar
          Hughey</a>. On July thirtieth we drove seventy-five miles to Mt.
        Ranier National Park and walked about eight miles on the ruin of the
        Nisqually Glacier. In two of those miles we made an elevation of two
        thousand feet.</p>
      <p> On July thirtieth we left Tacoma, taking Cousin Ed and Em with us, and
        drove to Seattle where we took the boat, and crossed Puget Sound to the
        home of Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I941">Georgia
          Congdon</a> Parks, ate a fine chicken dinner, enjoyed the wonderful
        view and beautiful flowers, and left the next morning for Portland, the
        home of Cousin Frank Horton and family. Frank is in business there and
        is prospering. He had just bought a new grocery store when we were
        there. While we were there we saw many of our home friends who live in
        this beautiful city. We spent a pleasant hour with Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charles
          Congdon</a><sup>7</sup>.</p>
      <p> We returned to Independence on August fifth and spent several more
        days with the Hortons and the Kimballs. After shedding some of the
        characteristic Campbell tears, we left on August twelfth for our
        homeward trip. We visited Crater Lake, and saw Mt. Shasta for one
        hundred seventy-one miles.</p>

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>6. Faith continues to be remarkable, becoming the first woman dean at
        the U. of Oregon. And, as of this footnote's writing (July, 2013),
        continues to be remarkable. She is both the only surviving writer of a
        CCC letter (Vol. 3 pp96-97), and she also is the oldest living member of
        our "clan".</p>
      <p>7. Charlie lived in NYC. He may have been visiting Portland on
        business.</p>

      <p> When one travels over this great, accordian <span class="Annotqtion">[sic]</span>
        plaited country, it makes one feel very small indeed, and yet we are not
        as small as a sparrow. We visited the Yosemite Valley and traveled over
        some of the most dangerous roads in this gold mining country. The big
        trees of the Sequoia Forest were a wonder to us.</p>
      <p> It was very hot through California and Arizona, especially over the
        Mohave Desert. We traveled over the Old Trails Road, the Santa Fe Route
        and Park to Park Highway. We visited the Grand Canyon of the Colorado,
        and as has been truly said, it is the most "sublime spectacle in the
        world". We camped at the Cliff Dwellings, visited the Presbyterian
        Mission School at Albuquerque, and the oldest church in America at Santa
        Fe, New Mexico. The Indians in their native dress, their homes, their
        pottery and all were very interesting to us.</p>
      <p> On August thirtieth we left Bucklin, Missouri, and drove on a very
        rough, roller coaster road, passing through Hamilton, Missouri, the
        birthplace of Mark Twain, crossed the Mississippi and and Illinois
        Rivers and camped at Spring-field, Illinois, where we saw the homestead
        of Abraham Lincoln. We came on home through Indiana, Ohio and West
        Virginia, driving about one thousand twenty seven miles in the last four
        days. We arrived home on September fourth, after having driven ten
        thousand two hundred twenty-five miles on the whole trip<sup>8</sup>. We
        have a fine collection of pictures which we hope you all may enjoy when
        you visit us.</p>
      <p> I have already written far too long a letter, but I only wish that
        time and space would permit me to go more into detail about our trip,
        the grandeur of the five national parks which we visited, the wonderful
        time we had with our relatives and how prosperous they all are, their
        lovely homes and how much they all did for our pleasure. It is like a
        dream now, and a three months which we shall never forget. It is worth
        every effort one can possibly put forth to take this trip, and there is
        no way to travel which can equal traveling by auto.</p>
      <p> The family join with me in sending love and best wishes to all.</p>

      <p>8. Considering what roads and cars were like in 1925, this was an
        amazing trip. I suspect very few people had made one like it.</p>
