<p>
        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        I suppose I am the last one to send in my letter but as you all know, I
        am always about two jumps behind all the rest.
      </p>
<p>
        Last June and July I was out in Orleans County, New York; was there
        during the cherry harvest, which I enjoyed very much, watching them
        first grow and mature, then being able to to to the orchard and pick
        and eat all - sometimes more - than one could carry<sup>1</sup>.
      </p>
<p>
        In October, most of the Cousins were present at Cousin <a href="TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie Clark</a>'s to the annual dinner, which
        we all know was a perfect success; a delightful dinner, a good visit
        with each one and getting the very good photos of so many, which I
        expect we will all have a chance to enjoy. We hope we may have a "full
        house" at the next Cousins Dinner.
      </p>
<p>
        The last of October I went down to Maplewood, N.J., to assist, if I
        could, at the coming wedding of Cousin <span wc_id="I1605">
        Doris Selph</span>. The weather was fine; of course there was plenty of
        work to do, but it was such fun, as <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will</a> and <span wc_id="I1604">
        Edith</span> are such capital entertainers, and it is hard to tell who was
        the most interested in the wedding, the man who gave the bride away or
        the man who received the bride. Now I don't mean that Cousin Will was
        anxious to have Doris leave home, but he was so pleased to see her
        happy in her new home, and if you all knew Doris' husband, <span wc_id="I1606">
        Philip</span>, I think you would all like him very much.
      </p>
<p>
        At Christmas time I went to Buffalo to stay with one of my <span wc_id="I1116">
        grandsons</span> who was married the first of November; spent a very
        pleasant winter; it was very cold there, but not much snow right in the
        city. In the surrounding country there was plenty of snow banks.
      </p>
<p>
        At last I am back in Nelson and expect to settle down and stay at home.
        I have stepped on the gas and been on the tilt quite lively for the
        past two years. After this if any of you want to know of my
        "whereabouts" come to Aunt <a href="CampbellElizabeth1830.html">Lib
        Hughey</a>'s old home and there you will find us ready to receive you
        as the latch string hangs on the door<sup>2</sup>.

        1. Several of her children spent summers in that area harvesting crops.
      </p>
<p>
        2. Log cabins of that era didn't have door locks or door knobs They had
        a door latch, with a string attached. To allow the door to be opened
        from the outside, they closed the door with the string sticking out so
        it could pull on the string to lift the latch. and open the door.

        Was very sorry to hear of the sudden death of Cousin <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil Young</a> I extend my sympathy to the wife
        and children.
      </p>
<p>
        Last evening the familiar face and form of Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie Congdon</a> put in an appearance in
        town; he seemed to have quite a cold, but wanted to see us all if only
        for a few minutes. He told us of the marriage of his daughter, <span wc_id="I962">
        Bernice</span>, who has gone to live in Arizona for the present.
      </p>
<p>
        As Cousins <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a> and <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">Frank</a> are making arrangements for their
        golden wedding anniversary, it reminds me of their wedding fifty years
        ago, when <span wc_id="I835">
        Jessie Campbell</span> and I helped to get their home ready for their new
        housekeeping. <span wc_id="I1476">
        Dell Campbell</span> worked for them on the farm that summer.
      </p>
<p>
        Fifty years ago the fourth of this month I left the <a href="http://www.joycetice.com/schools/orphans/orphans.htm">Orphan
        School</a> at Mansfield. My hair was red and I was round like a
        pumpkin; my weight at that time was nearly what it is now.
      </p>
<p>
        We will all be so glad when Spring and warm weather arrive think we all
        will feel better. There has been a great deal of sickness here this
        winter.
      </p>
<p>
        It is now warm sugar time<sup>3</sup>, but <span wc_id="I1171">
        Mark (Owlett</span>) is not making any this year, as his time is taken up
        with the arrival of a new baby girl, born February 28th; her name is
        <span wc_id="I1180">
        Helen Marie</span>, so you see I keep adding a bud now and then to the
        tree of kinship.
      </p>
<p>
        Hope to hear from everyone and that we may all be spared to write a
        letter next year.
      </p>
<p>
        With much love,
      </p>

        3. Maple sap was boiled to evaporate water, first reaching the
        consistency of maple syrup and boilded down further to make maple sugar
        and the concentrated syrup was poured into molds to become maple sugar
        once it cooled. But before it cooled, it was "warm sugar".
