        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        I am very glad to contribute a message to the Cousins Correspondence. I
        always enjoy reading the letters from the others as soon as they are
        received.
      </p>
<p>
        With the two boys, <span wc_id="I783">
        Richard</span> and <span wc_id="I785">
        George Robert</span>, we are very busy and happy. The boys are both in
        Junior High School, -- are both very musical and are playing some
        instrument or whistling most of the time. George Robert is twelve years
        old and plays instruments from Jews Harp to violin upon which he is
        taking lessons. Richard, fourteen years old, enjoys his drum. I am
        teaching music and have an orchestra of eleven children which we call
        the Mah Jongg Orchestra. We all love music.
      </p>
<p>
        Some of you may have remember <span wc_id="I704">
        Uncle John</span> and <span wc_id="I703">
        Aunt Dell</span> Shipman<sup>1</sup>. They have lived here in Mansfield
        for eleven years. On March 18th, they celebrated their Golden Wedding
        Anniversary by giving a six o'clock dinner at their home to sixteen
        relatives, three of whom were at their wedding in 1874. These were Aunt
        Dell's sisters, <span wc_id="I709">
        Mrs. Taft</span> and <span wc_id="I750">

      </p>
<p>
        Their only daughter, <span wc_id="I707">
        Carrie</span><sup>3</sup> died five years ago. They received about a
        hundred cards and lovely greetings, many of them from you.
