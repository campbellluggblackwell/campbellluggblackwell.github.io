        <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Message">
        <p> Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> has asked me
          to write a letter to the Cousins this spring and as I have been in
          Pittsfield with <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I981">Emily</a>
          since November, I may be able to tell you more than my <a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">Father</a>,
          but when I am at home, there is nothing I could say that could not be
          included in his letter.<br>
        </p>
        <p> It has been a great pleasure to me to read the letters from the
          Cousins and to see their faces.</p>
        <p> I was rather wishing that cousin Will would overlook my name but as
          he did not, I will try to do my share toward making the next
          collection of letters a success.</p>
        <p> I have spent one winter before this in New England but it happened
          to be the exceptionally warm winter a few years ago.</p>
        <p>This winter has been staged especially for my benefit and has given
          me a glimpse of what the Pilgrims endured in 1620.</p>
        <p>In New England, winter comes early and stays late, but I never saw
          children hav1<sup>e so good a time as they have had since the snow and
            ice came.</sup></p>
        <p>With two boys<sup>1</sup> in the house, I have become very much
          interested in "Winter Sports" and should like nothing better than to
          take part in all of them. I have been over on the East hill with my
          nephews and if I did not risk my life on skis, I surely did ride down
          hill on a big sled with <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I992">Marcus</a>
          and one of his friends.</p>
        <p>New England is the place to bring up boys and I hope that Charles,
          Jr. and Marcus may go to "Dartmouth" and live the outdoor life of the
          college students.</p>

          wishes me to tell you that Mark Twain says "If you don't like New
          England weather. -- wait a minute."</p>
        <p>And <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I982">Charles</a>
          says that I should be here in a regular winter, -- that this is a mild
          one.</p>
        <p>That makes me feel as though I have given you a wrong idea of the
          weather, and to justify myself I will say in the terms of the Nursery
          Rhyme:</p>
        <div>
          <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "When the weather
            is mild,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's very,
            very cold;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but when
            it's cold,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's
            frigid."</blockquote>

          <p>The warm days come and one can enjoy automobiling, the Berkshires,
            of which Pittsfield is the heart, are a constant source of delight
            of which one never tires.</p>
          <p>Emily is an efficient and careful driver and we spend many
            afternoons riding and enjoying the beautiful scenery.</p>
          <p>I do not know when I shall return to Pennsylvania, but not until <a

            come or Emily and her family go to Nelson for their vacation<sup>2</sup>.</p>
          <p>I nearly forgot to tell you that there isn't a better cook in the
            world than Emily and I advise all of you to call<sup>3</sup> when
            you are near Pittsfield.</p>
          <p>Emily hopes that you will be willing to excuse her from writing
            this time. She is very busy and says that my letter must do for the
            whole family.</p>
