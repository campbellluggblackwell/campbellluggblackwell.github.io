<div class="Salutation">
<p>
        Dear Cousins-In-Law:-
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        Having been thrice reminded that another year has departed and that
        "Uncle Sam" is waiting, - with an hourglass in one hand and a yawning
        mail bag in the other, - to receive the "offerings" now due or
        overdue,<sup>1</sup> and having failed to persuade a certain relative
        of mine that the undersigned might well be excused this time,- this
        small contribution is sent.
      </p>
<p>
        No wonderful experiences have I to relate, no trips by land or sea to
        any unknown quarters of the globe, but only usual and everyday
        happenings to tell of. Last November, we felt we were living through a
        very unusual experience when one day, <span wc_id="I1605">
        Doris</span>' possessions left our home and we were confronted with a room
        very empty; and soon after when on a memorable day, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">she</span> went away to another home, -
        this feeling grew. And yet, we were living through events that come to
        hundreds of homes, and while we have started and are traveling often -
        "A long, long trail a-winding" between the land of Morristown and
        Maplewood, we are only doing what many of you have already done when
        your children have gone away from the old home.<br/>
</p>
<p>
        The other day, a very interesting and alluring invitation came to us
        from Florida asking us to come and help celebrate a very important
        event soon to take place there<sup>2</sup>. We wish that we might write
        "Yes, we're coming" and start tomorrow; but well have to wait a little
        longer before we can visit the palms and orange groves of the "sunny
        Southland". And from Washington, a certain lady<sup>3</sup> writes that
        she has authentic information that the Japanese cherry trees will burst
        into bloom the middle of April; and we'd like to go there. And
        sometimes, the Pacific coast calls "Westward Ho!" But Maplewood will
        probably be our biding place until the first of June when our caravan
        will travel a little further up the road<sup>4</sup> and rest there for
        the summer season.
      </p>
<p>
        We did however, feel glad that "we three Selphs" could steal away to
        Pennsylvania for a few days in October to attend the "Cousins' Dinner".
        The occasion was a most enjoyable one, long to be remembered; and we
        wished that all the Cousins might have gathered that day in <a href="TubbsMinnie1864.html">Cousin Minnie</a>'s hospitable home. We greatly
        missed those who could not be there.

        The suggestion from Boston<sup>5</sup> started a train of thought in my
        mind on the ever interesting topic of "Radio"; and I'm wondering what
        would happen should some of the Campbell ancestors appear one morning
        and be greeted by a voice from the air jovially inquiring: "Good
        Morning! Have you had your glass of water?" Well we are all in a state
        of wonderment and question as to the voices, and one can even now quite
        believe that Joan of Arc heard them long ago. From the "Morning Watch"
        with the old hymns falling on our ears to a little later in the
        morning, when lectures on various subjects may be listened to, on the
        noontime when the organ peals forth from New York Church, - we may be
        continually entertained and instructed, <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">William</a> comes home and opens the door at
        six o'clock to the strains of the Waldorf Dinner Music<sup>6</sup> and
        after dinner may listen to the Marine Band or a Philharmonic Recital or
        hear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Talley">Marion
        Talley</a>'s young voice clearly singing "Home, Sweet Home!" On Sunday,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Parkes_Cadman">Dr.
        Cadman</a>'s sermons are broadcasted together with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edna_White">Gloria Trumpeters</a>' music.
        Surely a wonderful variety t please the most fastidious! We have not
        time to listen to all we would wish, for we are, like everyone else
        these days - busy.
      </p>
<p>
        We are just now interested in the daily progress of the big machines
        across the street. which is digging for the foundation of our new
        Church Parish House,- for we have outgrown our present accommodations.
        A walk along the streets will soon show similar excavations for other
        Churches, Woman's Club House, Bank and Post Office buildings, all of
        which spell "Growth".
      </p>
<p>
        And now that I have "written of many things", I have also been thinking
        of "Letters:, a big subject. "Round Robins" have been carried on among
        large families and certain groups of people; but as yet, I doubt if
        there is another family that is exchanging a collection of letters
        similar to this Correspondence idea. How many reminiscent conversations
        start:- "Do you know what John or Jane or Julia is doing now or where
        they are living?" "Is William still in California?" Or, "Did you
        <span class="Annotation">[know/hear]</span> that James' son stands at
        the head of his profession?" Letters may answer all questions if the
        writers so wish and thus distance only separates families and keeps
        them "out of touch" one with the other. It occurs to me that it was a
        letter sent by Cousin <a href="HugheyHerbert1857.html">Herbert
        Hughey</a> in response to a photo sent to him, - a very interesting
        <a href="HerbHugheyLetter2WillSelph19230215.html">
        letter</a> received but a short time before his death - that started
        this Correspondence, these "letters from home" as one Cousin wrote.

        Some of us can still claim among our possessions, - an attic. In mine,
        among other ancient heirlooms, are some of my grandmother's beautifully
        quilted coverlets, a Paisley shawl, a blue and white woven coverlet and
        some trinkets more than a century old, - a lace bib that the writer
        once wore and among some ancient Valentine missives carefully preserved
        are some childish scrawls and cards and letters painstakingly printed
        "from Doris".
      </p>
<p>
        Now one day in the future, someone perhaps will take out of a little
        trunk, from among "scraps of brocade and taffeta, yellowed lingerie, a
        quaint old wedding gown, and daguerreotypes in ornate cases", a book of
        letters not "tied with faded ribbon" but well preserved in their strong
        covers; and someone will say: "Here is a letter from grandmother or
        uncle or aunt, - let us read what they did years ago", and these
        letters will be the ones now being written by the present "Campbell
        Cousins" that will be read years hence.
      </p>
<p>
        "Far away in the 'peace which passeth all understanding' the writers of
        the letters sleep; but on the attic floor a re heard footsteps that
        have long been silent; and voices whisper from the other end of the
        room."
      </p>
<p>
        Perhaps these very letters we are writing today will be treasured in
        the days to come, who can tell?<sup>7</sup>

<p>
        Trusting that these "wanderings" of mine have not wearied you, I am,

        7. Yes, Edith, they are cherished. And perhaps, thanks to digitizing
        and putting them on the web, they electronic versions will continue to
        be cherished long after the original's mimeograph ink has faded and the
        paper crumbled.
