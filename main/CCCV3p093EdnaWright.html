      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> Since this is my first attempt at writing a "Cousins Letter " you will
        pardon me if it's a little longer than it should be and if I get too
        personal, but there are so few of you who know my family. </p>
      <p> <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I848">Lynn</a>,
        the oldest of my little flock, has developed into a very fine young man,
        and with <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I855">Donald</a>,
        a true Campbell both in looks and actions, has shouldered the burdens of
        the family. The boys for the past two years have been pharmacist mates
        in the U. S. Navy and have acquired through hard study a considerable
        knowledge of medicine which has broadened them from boys into real men.
        Owing to the condition of my health during the past year and through
        necessity brought about by an injury, I had the boys come home through a
        special order discharge on the thirteenth of February, and we are all
        very happy together. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I864">Billy</a>,
        who is thirteen, is a senior in the junior high school and doing
        splendid work. I have great expectations for Billy, as he learns very
        easily and is very studious. </p>
      <p>I so often wondered when each new baby came why I was always sent boys,
        but God in His wisdom knew best. I do not forget dear little <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I873">Betty</a>
        who is such a darling, always so gentle and sweet, smoothing out the
        rough places and even now, although only eight years old, looking out
        for the needs of her brothers. She has been dangerously ill since
        Christmas with whooping cough in its severest form, and many times we
        feared each coughing spell would be the last, but she would look up and
        say "Mama dear, Jesus helped me through that one. I knew He would
        because I asked Him to." It's wonderful the faith children have.</p>
      <p>We enjoyed our trip to Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie</a>'s
        last fall to attend the Cousins Dinner, the first one I ever attended. <a
          href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I836">Papa</a>
        and I went with Brother <a href="EllisonHugh1888.html">Hugh</a> and his
        <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I876">wife</a>.
        Papa is looking very well this spring and sends greetings to you all. I
        left Marshalls Falls for New York to see the boys who were located in
        the Naval Hospital at that time, and while I was there went to see
        Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will</a> and found Cousin <a href="SelphJennie1873.html">Jennie</a>,
        <a href="LoopStella1863.html">Stella</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1608">Alta</a>
        there waiting for me to go out to lunch with them. Cousin Will surely is
        a wonderful entertainer. After</p>

      <p> luncheon we went to the six hundredth performance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ten_Commandments_%281923_film%29">The
          Ten Commandments</a> which is the very best photo play I have ever
        attended, and I have seen some very good ones as I played for motion
        pictures in Washington, D.C. during the summer of 1919. Then we went out
        to Cousin Will's home in Maplewood<sup>1</sup> where I was royally
        entertained. Then on Sunday morning Cousins Jennie, Alta, Will and I
        drove out to Madison<sup>1</sup> where I staid <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>
