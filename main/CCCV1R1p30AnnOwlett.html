            <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1057">Sister</a>:-</p>

              endured". This is quite a proposition to try to talk to an
              audience that is so scattered as this "dear family" of Cousins is.
              Anyway, this is a grand thought and deed of Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will</a>
              to try to come closer to each other and I hope it will be a
              success in every way. One regret is we did not have this started
              while more of us were here to enjoy these letters, but we will
              have much pleasure with those that are left of us. <br>

              for Cousin <a href="LoopStella1863.html">Stella</a> while she is
              in Elmira. I hope when she comes home she will have new feet and
              eyes, as hers are nearly worn out. Most of us know that small as
              her family is, she takes a great many steps in a day. Charlie Loop
              <span style="font-style: italic;">[Stella's uncle]</span> once
              said, "Stella, your heart is bigger than your body". Well said, I
              think. <br>

              usual. Our eldest daughter (<a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1111">Faye</a>)
              and her family, which is her husband</font><font size="4"> and two
              sons; and our two youngest sons <span style="font-style: italic;">[Burton

              State. The rest of the children are near Nelson. I hope to keep
              the name of Owlett good. We have only one grandson by that name;
              he was born March 8th, 1923; his name is <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1169">Harold

              "Joe Howe" or Joseph B. Howe,&#8209; a great friend to the Campbell
              family and to every one else. He has been in poor health for a
              long time; at last he died of dropsy <span style="font-style: italic;">[Congestive
                Heart Failure]</span>, and was laid to rest in the Nelson
              Cemetery, today,&#8209; June 14, 1923. Had he lived until next August
              19th, he would have been eighty&#8209;three years of age. He was in the
              Civil War, same Company as my father, "<a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1043">Uncle
                Mac</a>"; he was with Pa when he fell from his horse; helped him
              to get back on the horse, and took him to the hospital where my
              father lived only three days.<br>
