<p>
        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        I have been reminded by two or three different Cousins, to not be late
        with my Cousin letter, so I better get busy.
      </p>
<p>
        Today is the last day of March and showing hard. This last winter has
        been a long cold one, with plenty of snow, ice and especially wind. We
        have had but very few days of sunshine so far this spring, but we hope
        to see some warm weather soon.
      </p>
<p>
        This past year with us has been generally uneventful and so little of
        interest has happend in our family, I hardly have anything to say. If
        all you Cousins were interested in cattle, sheep, etc., I could write
        pages, as that is my line.&lt;/&gt;
      </p>
<p>
        Saturday, March 20th, being <span wc_id="I1015">
        Rex</span>'s birthday, we all spent the day down at <a href="SeelyJud1851.html">father</a>'s, enjoyed a fine dinner, birthday cake
        and all.
      </p>
<p>
        The children are all at home, that is, when not in school. <span wc_id="I1030">
        Beryl</span> attends High School in Elkland, and walks from home, a
        distance of about two and a half miles. <span wc_id="I1035">
        Allen Jud</span> is spending his first year in school at Osceola. <span wc_id="I1014">
        Dora</span> is teaching at Nelson, but is home every week end, and Rex is
        helping me on the farm. We sure do not get lonesome when the young
        folks are around, something dong every minute.
      </p>
<p>
        We were unable to attend the Cousins Dinner last fall, much as we had
        wisheddd, so se missed a pleasant visit with the Cousins.
      </p>
<p>
        With best wishes to all,
      </p>
