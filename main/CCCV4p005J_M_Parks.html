      <p> Yours of June 1st is at hand. I received the book and acknowledge
        same. Say, you do not know how I appreciate your kindness in making it
        possible for me to have one of those books. <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">C.
          H. Congdon</a> sent one to <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1708">Em</a>
        and me to read, -- the first issue -- and we returned it. I appreciate <a
          href="SeelyJud1851.html">Jud Seely</a>'s thoughtfulness in giving my
        name as one to receive the Cousins Book of letters. But this time my
        wife was not present<sup>1</sup> with me to talk about the different
        composers of those letters, which keeps the chain of relationship
        together.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p>I cannot comprehend the effort you have give to complete such a book. I
        take pride in showing it to some people who are capable of realizing the
        effort such an undertaking requires.</p>
      <p> I hope you and your wife can make me a visit. My sister-in-law is
        keeping the house open and making it possible for me to have a home.</p>
      <p>I spent three months last winter in Florida and California, but was
        glad to come back to my own home.</p>
