            <p>Going to high school was not easy, for we lived six miles from
              Brainerd and had no car. My parents and the parents of Pearl
              Thomas talked it over and decided to get rooms for us in town
              where we could care for ourselves during the week, coming home on
              weekends. And so two rooms were rented for us from Mr. and Mrs.
              Pat O'Brien who lived right downtown over Skauge's Drug Store. </p>
            <p><img src="Sled.svg" alt="Drawing of a horse drawn, two passenger, sleigh"
                style="width:20%;">Speaking of transportation, Pearl has a
              beautiful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_%28horse%29">driving
                horse</a> of her own and a beautiful <a href="https://goneoutdoors.com/difference-between-cutter-sleigh-8560748.html">cutter</a>.
              Of course she couldn't keep the horse and cutter in town.</p>
            <p>I can't imagine what kind of cooks Pearl and I were. Mrs. O'Brien
              was good to us and often gave to us some hot food. Our Mothers
              took turns at cooking up a weekly supply of things. I remember,
              especially, that when it was Pearl's turn, her Mother would bake
              the most delicious devils food cake covered with coconut frosting.
              I really loved that cake and when Pearl unpacked her food I would
              ask if she had brought a devils food cake. She usually had one and
              we would immediately eat it up, instead of making it last for the
              week. </p>
            <p><img src="Bible.png" alt="Drawing of a Bible" style="width:15%;">In
              our Sophomore year an event took place that was the turning point
              for my life. Many of the churches in town joined in erecting a
              wooden tabernacle calling an evangelist for a joint crusade. We
              two heard about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revival_meeting">meetings</a>.
              High school students used to talk about it quite a bit. Pearl and
              I planned to go sometime, but a couple of weeks slipped by before
              we really did. When we finally went, we were greatly impressed,
              but we had other plans, even though had agreed and made a sort of
              commitment which probably wooed us to return. But we did not hurry
              back. For one thing we had planned to see a certain movie (the
              silent, ten cent variety), so we went. The next day my old friend
              Henrietta sent me a note. I remember what she wrote, "A fine
              Christian you've turned out to be. You take a stand for Christ one
              night in the Tabernacle, and the next night you go to the movies."
              I was astonished, so I wrote back. "Please tell me what is so
              wrong about that." She wrote back, "You had better go to hear
              Oscar Lourie again." </p>
            <p>Pearl and I did go back and what a sermon we heard! People were
              warned about three popular amusements that could hinder their
              spiritual life, even cause them to sin and <u>be lost,</u> to be
              shut from the presence of God forever! The three amusements were
              dancing, the theater and cards. Each was described so graphically
              evil, that we wanted no part in any of them. </p>
            <p><img src="Alice-in-Wonderland-cards-flying.svg" alt="Drawing of Alice 
              (of Wonderland) being attacked by a deck of cards" style="width:14%;">
              I had a small sized deck of cards. When we got home that night, I
              took my Little deck out of our desk. I looked at it in horror,
              took one card off the deck, tore it to pieces, saying in
              vehemence, "the vile things!" I through it on the floor. Pearl
              followed my example, tore up another card and threw it on the
              floor. So, one by one, we tore up the entire deck, then joining
              hands, we stamped and jumped on them, all the time calling them
              "the vile things." I've never been comfortable around cards since!
            </p>
            <p>Those meetings, called the "Lowrie-Moody Meeting" made a profound
              difference in the church life of Brainerd. The campaign lasted six
              weeks and the lives of of adults and children were changed from
              indifference to ardent zeal. Pearl was Roman Catholic; I was
              Presbyterian; but we were agreed as to our stand for truth and
              righteousness.</p>
            <p>Soon after that my brother, Harry, and I, joined the Presbyterian
              Church as communicant members. So many of our high school mates
              had taken a "stand for the Lord" that we had an active social life
              governed by our churches.</p>
            <p>In the Presbyterian church the teen aged girls were banded
              together in a class named "The Do Your Best Class," or commonly
              called the "DYB's". Our teacher was Reverend William J. Lowrie,
              pastor of the Presbyterian Church. The boys were also banded
              together in a similar class. They were called the BFC's or the
              Boys Fellowship Class. Mrs. John McKay was their teacher. </p>
            <p>In the summer time the DYB's would rent a cottage at one of the
              nearby lakes for a week or two and would likely ask the Boys
              Fellowship teacher, Mrs. McKay to go along as a chaperone. One of
              the class lived at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisswa,_Minnesota">Nisswa</a>.
              She had come to Brainerd for her high school training and had
              joined the DYBs. Once Annie Matson, that was her name, invited the
              class to come to her home for an outing. </p>
            <p>Once I invited the class to my country home for a weekend slumber
              party. My family owned a tent so that was put up in the yard for
              an extra bedroom and Mother made up two beds in it. The rest of
              the girls slept in the house. There were fourteen of us. Harry
              invited some of the Boys Fellowship Class to come out and spend
              the night with him, sleeping in the hay mow. I know they had a
              good time planning tricks on us girls. I don't remember all that
              we did, but three kodak pictures, we girls had taken up by the
              schoolhouse on our farm, show how happy we were. </p>
            <p>One picture is of us standing in line with Annie Matson, the
              tallest one at the head and Gladys Hess, the shortest at the foot.
              All of the girls except me had <u>long</u> dresses. Mine was only
              calf length for Mother didn't consider I was old enough to wear
              long dresses. I was fourteen. In the picture I managed to stand
              behind some of the girls so my legs would not show. </p>
            <p>Now at 83, I look at those pictures and recall the fun we had. I
              remember those girls as forming the finest group fellowship I ever
              enjoyed. I can name everyone in the picture. Going down the lineup
              was Anne Matson, <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:SPSV-LJY">Marion
                Opsahl</a>, Hazel Squires, <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:SPSV-LJY">Violet
                Cregar</a>, Helen Knebel, <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M2LL-N9Z">Dorothy
                Wright</a>, <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MWY7-JMS">Pearl
                Vaughan</a>, (I hear from her at Christmas time), Edith Turner,
              Ethel Nelson, Rose Turner, Gladys Turner, Marvel Putz, I, Mary
              Hughey and Gladys Hess. At least half the class has passed away. A
              few years back Pearl Vaughan and I got in touch and now we at
              least exchange Christmas messages. </p>
            <p>When we were little girls about eight years old, we had gotten
              acquainted. Pearl's father was a cement contractor and I believe
              my father had him come out to our country home and put a cement
              basement under our home. It had two rooms. One was very clean and
              tidy and there my mother had shelves for large stone crocks or
              bowls. Thad was before we owned a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br0H1HfQu98">DeLaval
                cream separator</a>. The cream was lifted from the top with a
              sort of skimmer and put in a cream can. Mother churned the cream
              in a large wooden churn turned with a hand crank. For years she
              won first prize at the Crow Wing County Fair for her butter. She
              had regular customers for her butter in the town of Brainerd. I'm
              sure that my early education was largely financed by mother's
              butter and eggs that she sold.</p>
            <p>I started to tell you about the early friendship between Pearl
              Vaughn and me. We used to exchange visits during our summer
              vacation. One week Pearl would come out and stay with me. Another,
              I would go to Brainerd to visit her and her younger sister, Ruth.
              Pearl and Ruth had many beautiful toys, especially dolls. They
              were very generous with them, so we had many happy hours together.
            </p>
            <p><img src="Parsnip.svg" alt="Drawing of a parsnip" style="width:3%;">The
              basement that Mr. Vaughn made for us Hugheys was a wonderful
              addition to our home. The first or <u>big</u> room was where we
              particularly stored vegetables. There were bins of potatoes,
              rutabagas, parsnips, carrots and a large hanging shelf with a
              slotted bottom for onions. Both mother and dad had come from an
              apple country, eastern Pennsylvania and southern New York. Hence
              they could not imagine being without apples during the winter
              days. </p>
            <p>When they were first married and after they moved to the farm,
              the aunts and uncles from "back East" would ship a barrel of
              apples to them. Russets, Winesaps, <a href="https://www.treesofantiquity.com/products/black-gilliflower-apple">Gilliflowers</a>
              and Greenings were some of the apples and packed in the top of the
              barrel were items of dried grapes (raisins) and also a few hickory
              nuts and black walnuts. </p>
            <p>I graduated from the eighth grade in the District #3 County
              School the spring of 1913 as I have already recounted. I graduated
              from high school in June 1917. That was the year when World War I
              began.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#WW1"></a> Our
              class went to the Brainerd railroad depot "in mass" to bid

            <p>My high school days were happy times for me. I made many new
              friends and life became more and more interesting. In my senior
              year, a "Normal Training" was added to high school. I became
              interested, so that I enrolled in it the next year and became a
              post graduate student of the high school and obtained my teacher's
              certificate entitling me to teach in the rural schools of
              Minnesota. <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/204789659/bertha-lawrence">Bertha
