          <p>My Father was <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Essex-236">Richard Essex</a>
          he married my mother as his 2<sup><u>nd</u></sup> wife when he was 64 years old and my 
          mother over 42. Mother only had two children 1<sup><u>st</u></sup> a daughter who only 
        lived a few hours and me. I was born May 22<sup><u>nd</u></sup> 1842 and my wife is 
      about 1 year older. The farming interest here suffer very much indeed as 
    corn<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"

    href="#Corn"></a> is at such a low price and the natural consequence land's proprietors 
  suffer which necessarily causes a great dulness [sic] in trade generally. My business has 
been fearfully bad this past summer but we have a few jobs now. Cloth manufacture is the staple 
industry of this part of the country<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"

href="#CotswoldSheep"></a> but the trade has suffered correspondingly with other trades and there 
is 10 or 12 factories cloth and silk now lying idle. I sincerely hope that you and Mr. Hoyt will 
get better in health and that our young cousins J.D. and Ina [sic] will keep in good health. 
We shall be pleased to hear from you any time you like to send us a line. when you see 
<a href="CampbellJoseph1839.html">Mr. Campbell</a>, Mrs. Campbell or 
<a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Campbell-32049">Grace</a> kindly give our kind love and 
tell them we are expecting to hear from them every day and to receive their photo, 
hoping soon to receice all yours with kindest love and affection from me and all my family 
allow me to remain your affectionate cousin</p>
