      <p>1. A neighborhood of Nailsworth.</p>
      <p> 2. There are a number of interesting things about this will. John
        Blackwell had 11 children by his first wife <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cole-14464">Sarah
          Cole</a>: 7 sons and 3 daughters. And none by 2nd wife, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Barrett-9423">Frances
          Barrett</a>, or 3rd wife, Mary Saunders. He was predeceased by two of
        his daughters, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-3670">Sarah
          (Blackwell</a>) Barnfield and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-3673">Phebe
          Blackwell</a>; and by sons <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-3668">John</a>
        and Enoch. His will does not mention his daughters, but does mention one
        of Sarah's sons, Edward Barnfield. Why none of his other grandchildren
        are mentioned is a mystery. As is why daughter <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-3671">Lucretia
          (Blackwell</a>) Perrin is not mentioned, nor sons Thomas and Joshua.
        Perhaps it's because Lucretia, Thomas and Joshua "left him" and went to
        America. But so did Enoch and Peter who are mentioned. We don't know for
        sure why he singled out one daughter-in-law to mention. But he was 86 at
        the time of making this will and "in weak state of health," so it may
        that she was his primary caregiver, but his wife Mary was only 30 ----
        younger than any of John's children. </p>
      <p>3. Windsoredge is just north-west of Nailsworth.</p>
      <p> 4. Estimates vary. But each 1820 pound sterling would be at the very
        least $109.18 US 2014. Some estimates place it 100 times higher,
        depending on the assumptions made. Enoch had 9 children, but one died
        young. So a bequest of £70 would come to the equivalent of at least $955
        2014 each -- possibly several hundred times more. And £30 worth of
        brandy would have been a heck of a lot of gallons. </p>
      <p> 5. I wonder what went into the decision of how much to give to each:
        need, merit or what. </p>
      <p> 6. Edward had three sisters and a brother, but he was the eldest son.
        That might explain why his siblings were not included in the will, but
        not why none of the other grandchildren were singled out. </p>
      <p> 7. "For convenience, trustees always hold as joint tenants. A grant to
        A and B and their heirs made a joint tenancy. Tenants in common hold
        undivided portions as separate beings, and their respective shares pass
        to their heirs, etc." </p>
