      <p>Dear Campbell Cousins:-</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> For sometime I've been wondering when we "third raters" were ever
        going to get a chance at the Cousins Book and now that the chance is
        here I've been wondering what I could ever write that would be of
        interest to any one. The fact is, there haven't many little things
        happened in our family. We are all here in St. Petersburg, well and
        happy. I'm an old maid, but there aren't many in the Campbell Family and
        I'm having a good time. I have a position with a landscape architect's
        firm, painting plans of Golf Courses, sub-divisions, etc. They build
        some of the finest Golf Courses in the country. Being connected with
        this sort of work has aroused my interest in the game so I'm trying to
        play in all the spare time I have. In fact I like it so well I wish I
        had nothing else to do. Net week-end our Office force are being
        entertained at the Country Club of one of our clients, We were given a
        similar outing in the fall and had such a wonderful time that we are all
        looking forward to another good time.</p>
      <p>I guess those of you who haven't been in Florida have heard all about
        it in previous letters so I won't tell you anything more - only wish you
        could all be here to enjoy this beautiful climate.</p>
