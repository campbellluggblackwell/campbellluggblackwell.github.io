              (1777 - 1824)</big></big></big><br>
      </big></p>
    <p><big><big><big>Sarah, called "Sally", was born Jun. 13, 1777, in Scotland
            or North Ireland; d. Nelson, PA. She married <a href="HazlettSamuel1780.html">Samuel
              Hazlett</a>, b. 1780 in Scotland. <br>
          </big></big></big></p>
    <p><big><big><big>She was the eldest of 8 children of <a href="CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph
              Campbell</a>, b. 1748, in Scotland, d. 1824 in Nelson, Tioga Co.,
            PA (originally called <a href="BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's
              Island</a>); and <a href="HarperMary1749.html">Mary Harper</a>,
            b. 1749, in Scotland, d. 1844 in Nelson. <br>
          </big></big></big></p>
    <big>
      <p><big><big>Sally's youngest brother <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James</a>
            was born in N. Ireland, but it's uncertain whether the older
            children were born in Scotland or N. Ireland. While in N. Ireland,
            they lived in Derry (if you're Irish) or Londonderry (if your English
            or Scottish), and in Country Antrim. Sally's parents, and his
            youngest siblings, sailed from Londonderry to Perth Amboy, NJ in
            1810 and arrived in Nelson early in 1811. </big></big></p>
      <p><big><big>We're not sure when Sally and Sam married, nor when they came
            to the US. There's a tradition that they were married aboard the
            ship, but no solid evidence. But we know their eldest child,
            Archibald, was born in Lancaster Co., PA in 1803. By 1806, they were
            living on a farm Sam bought near Stroudsburg, PA (which then was in
            Northampton Co., but now is in Monroe Co.) Sam started buying land
            on the north bank of the Cowanesque River, just east of what became
            the Boro of Nelson, Tioga Co., PA, from an early (but only stayed
            briefly) settler, Daniel Strait. He completed the purchase in 1810.
            At time it was wilderness, with no roads and only a few scattered
            cabins.<br>
          </big></big></p>
      <big><big>
          <p>Sally's father and her uncle <a href="CampbellJohn1761.html">John</a>
            bought the island from the Beechers, who moved away. Their property
            was on the south bank of the Cowanesque River. It was slightly west
            of the land on the north bank that Sam bought. Sam was the older
            brother of <a href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John Hazlett</a>, who
            married Sally's sister, <a href="CampbellJane1792.html">Jane</a>.
            Sam and Sarah came to the US before Sally's parents and, according
            to Munsell's <span style="font-style: italic;">History of Tioga Co.</span>,
            had a farm near Stroudsburg, PA, before Sam bought the Daniel Strait
            farm in Nelson. <br>
          </p>
          <p>Sarah and Sam had 7 children, but 3 died in infancy and may not
            have been named. Those that survived were: <br>
