      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>As I review the past months since I last wrote you there seems nothing
        of much interest to tell you about. Undoubtedly many of you know I have
        disposed of our former home here and am now occupying a four-room,
        heated apartment. Certainly this is a great change, but I rather enjoy
        it. One pleasant feature is that I am not more than fifteen minutes walk
        from my son <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1482">William</a>'s
        home, and only a block our of his way to business. As I have continued
        my work at the office, it makes it very nice for me as he comes for me
        in the morning and we return together at night.</p>

        and family have spent the winter in Paris, and there is a possibility
        they will remain in France another year. J. Harry Campbell was married
        to <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1479">Catharine
          DeWitt Chambers</a> of Port Jefferson, N. Y, September 17m 1913, They
        have two children, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1480">Catherine
