          PURPOSE</big></big></big><br>
    <p>
      <big><big>Many of our readers, when traveling (especially to our <a href="reunion2012.html">Campbells
            of Nelson Reunions</a>) would be interested in visiting the graves
          of their relatives. To help with this, we have created a list of <span

            style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">all</span>
          our known burials, domestic and foreign. It's sorted by:<br>
        </big></big>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style="list-style: none">
        <br>

      <li>
        <big>State (or country)/County/Municipality</big>

        known burials.</big></big><br>
    <big><big><br>
        <big>THE BURIALS LIST</big><br>
        Enjoy the <big><a href="CemeteriesByState.html" style="font-weight: bold;">burials
            list</a></big>, we hope it's useful.&nbsp; Additions and corrections
        are welcome, see our <span wc_id="unknown"> tree</span> for contact
        info. If a deceased descendant of our Campbells, Luggs or Blackwell's
        (or their spouse, father-in-law, or mother-in-law) is not shown, please
        send us their burial info.<br>
        <br>
        <big>VOLUNTEERS</big><br>
        Volunteers are needed to help add the burial lot info. Anyone reading
        this page has the necessary skills. I'll give you the URLs for looking
        up the data. I could do it all myself, but I have a lot of other things
        to do, and this is an easy way for you to help out with this web site.
        Your assistance will be appreciated and you will be given credit for
        your help. See our <span wc_id="unknown"> tree</span> for contact info.<br>
        <br>
        Pick the area you'd like to help with.<br>
        <br>
        We also need volunteers to serve as guides for tours of cemeteries near
        Nelson, PA. Out of the area visitors to our Campbell Reunions often want
        to visit local cemeteries. Our reunions held in even numbered years,
        usually in August. Therefore it's not a big demand on your time.
        Cemeteries visitors want to see include: Nelson Cem.; Lawrenceville's
        Powers Cem., Elkland's Highland Cem.; Osecola/Fairview Cem.; Knoxville's
        Riverside Cem.; Farmington Hill Cem.; &amp; Steuben's Baxter Hill Cem.<br>
