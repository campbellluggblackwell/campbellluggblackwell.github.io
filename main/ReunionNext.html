      <p>Our next reunion will be August 6, 2022, via ZOOM. Our 2020 reunion was
        held via ZOOM for the first time because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We
        missed the camaraderie of meeting in person, and the pleasure of sharing
        a pot luck meal. BUT, it provided an opportunity for many to join us for
        the first time. Cost, travel time, being a caregiver to others,
        infirmities of age, etc. instantly faded. For instance, a cousin joined
        us from a remote part of British Columbia who would not have come to
        Nelson. Perhaps cousins from other countries may decide to participate
        in the future -- no Visa &amp; passport needed. Nor airfare, hotels,
        meals, etc. (I met one of our English cousins, Rev. Edward Claude Essex
        years ago -- it would be great if more, including our English Blackwell
        cousins can join us.) </p>
      <p> Check back for later updates and for a ZOOM link.</p>
