      <p>Our next reunion will be August 6, 2022, via ZOOM Please join us via
        the Internet from your home. No travel time. No travel expenses.
        Infirmities OK. You don't have to appear on camera is you're shy-- it's
        "come as you are".</p>

      <p>Our 2020 reunion was held via ZOOM for the first time because of the
        COVID-19 pandemic. We missed the camaraderie of meeting in person, and
        the pleasure of sharing a pot luck meal. BUT, it provided an opportunity
        for many to join us for the first time. Cost, travel time, being a
        caregiver to others, infirmities of age, etc. instantly faded. For
        instance, a cousin joined us from a remote part of British Columbia who
        would not have come to Nelson. Perhaps cousins from other countries may
        decide to participate in the future -- no Visa &amp; passport needed.
        Nor airfare, hotels, meals, etc. (I met one of our English cousins, Rev.
        Edward Claude Essex years ago -- it would be great if more of our
        Campbell, Lugg &amp; Blackwell -- including our English Blackwell
        cousins -- can join us. Perhaps some of our cousins living in the
        Netherlands and Costa Rico will participate this year. The more the
        merrier.)</p>
      <p>Let's see how many states and countries will participate!<br>
