    <h1> Campbell Cousins Correspondence Club<br>
    </h1>
    <h2>How It Began </h2>
    <div>
      <p>Below are links to a packet that <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will
          Selph</a> mailed in April of 1923 to all his living Campbell first
        cousins. It explains how an exchange of letters with his first cousin, <a
          href="HugheyHerbert1857.html">Herbert Clinch Hughey</a>, and Herb's
        untimely death, inspired Will to form the Campbell Cousins
        Correspondence Club, </p>
      <p>Will and Herb had never written to each other, and had not laid eyes on
        each other since Will was a babe in arms. Herb had shortly thereafter
        moved from Nelson, PA to Minnesota, and had never returned. In 1922 Will
        had attended a Campbell Cousins Dinner, held at "The Owls Nest", the
        home of Andrew and <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Anna Bosard</a>
        Owlett, on Oregon Hill, PA, near the border of Tioga and Lycoming
        Counties. Will took a bunch of photos, had a prints made, created a
        small album of the photos, and sent one (accompanied by a cover letter)
        to each 1st cousins.</p>
      <p>In his reply Herb mentioned that he planned to attend the 1923 Campbell
        Cousins Dinner to once again see his relatives and acquaintances after
        so many years absence. For the first time, he felt he could leave his
        farm long enough to make the trip. But before that occurred, Herb died.
      </p>
      <p>That got Will thinking about how his 1st cousins, who grew up together
        in Nelson and were once so close, were now scattered all over the
        country --- WA, OR, FL, etc. - and now were dying. He came up with the
        idea of the correspondence club to help them get reacquainted and to
        remain in touch. All the cousins were to periodically send him a letter
        (he proposed 4 times a year, but they initially opted for twice a year
        --- and soon switched to annually). His office staff typed up the
        letters on stencils, a copy was run off for each cousins, they were
        bound, and Will mailed them the published letters. The first year in a
        ring binder; hardbound thereafter. </p>
