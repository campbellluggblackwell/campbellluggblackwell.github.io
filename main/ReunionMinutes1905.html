      <p>NEWS CLIPPING:</p>
      <p class="Message">The Campbell family reunion was held on the Nelson High
        School grounds on Thursday last and 150 Campbells or near relatives
        joined in the pleasures of that occasion. The lunch was a composite
        representative of the culinary skill of the family and for centuries
        back when the Campbells clan which was always one ot the most powerful
        of all Scotland they were noted for good living, refreshments were
        therefore fine and correspondingly enjoyed. After dinner a short program
        was rendered.&nbsp;<a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1478">Harry
          Campbell</a>, of Elmira sang two vocal solos and <a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">Mark
          Seely</a> read a history of the Campbell family of Argyle, Scotland
        whose descendents <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> the Cowanesque
        Campbells are. The article was a very interesting one and the fact was
        pointed out that the Eighth Duke of Agyle is a blood relative of the
        Campbells that joined in the reunion.<sup>1</sup></p>
      <p class="Message">The social intercourse was the real feature of the day
        and when the trains again diffused Scotland's best blood over Southern
        New York and Northern Pennsylvania it was with real regret that the
        goodbyes were said. A very neat badge was supplied each member and on it
        was stamped the Campbell crest and the date and place of the annual
        reunion. The president chosen for the next reunion was <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">T.
          C. Campbell</a>, of Knoxville, the place of the meeting the same as
        this year and the date the third Thursday of August.</p>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">[Written in the margin was the
        following: "TCC 1905 Re-Union. I was in Stroudsburg and did not
        attend."] </span> </div>
    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>1. In Scotland, the Campbells were divided into several clans, all of
        whom acknowleged the Duke of Argyll as their high chief. Among the major
        branches were: Campbells of Argyll; Breadalbane; Cawdor; and Louden. We
        know the grandchildren of brothers Joseph and James Campbell believed
        they were from the Argyll branch and "blood relatives" of the 8th Duke.
        But we don't know if that was just an oral tradition or if they had
        evidence for that. No documentation is know to survive.</p>
