      <p>
        My dear Cousins and All:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        We are reminded that it is again time for our Cousin letter, and
        promptness should be our motto. As the years go by it is more of an
        effort for some of us to write letters, especially when they are to be
        broadcast from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from the Gulf to Canada,
        so please make allowance for the older Cousins.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did not think when I wrote my Cousin letter two years ago from
        Florida, that I would be writing again from the beautiful city of St.
        Petersburg, but through the many kind invitations from <a href=
        "CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a> and <a href=
        "ParksFrances1855.html">Frank</a> I am spending another winter with
        them. As <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel</a> and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I773">
        Llewellyn</a> are here I am if possible having a more delightful time
        than before. I wish we might have more of our Cousins Dinners with
        Tommie and Frank, not alone for the wonderful climate, but for their
        lovely home, where they could entertain, with a real house party, every
        Cousin and Cousin-in-law, without any inconvenience whatever, and every
        other descendant of the <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph
        Campbell</a> family could be entertained at their pleasant and
        home-like hotel, with the same cordial hospitality which we always
        received at their open home in Knoxville, Pa.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are soon to celebrate their fiftieth wedding anniversary, and to
        see them one would think it their twenty fifth instead. No wrinkles and
        very few gray hairs,- which Tommie says is all due to the use of water
        from the "Fountain of Youth". I am sure if you could have seen him, as
        I did, this spring working on his income tax, you would have thought
        every hair on his head would be white. I realize more than ever before,
        what the writer of the saying "Blessed be Nothing" might have had in
        mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Very few from our large number of Cousins have been permitted to
        celebrate their fiftieth wedding anniversary; I can recall only five:-
        <a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">Mark Seely</a>, <a href=
        "CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed Congdon</a>, <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1057">
        Laura Mowrey</a>, sister <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Kate
        Horton</a> and Tommie. They surely have much for which to be thankful
        for as each year our Cousin Circle is broken, and there are many
        changes. This year we were saddened by the death of brother <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I836">
        Will Ellison</a>, who visited us the Sunday before he was taken, and
        the very sad going away of Cousin <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil
        Young</a>. We shall all miss them here, - but as our circle is getting
        so large on the other side, that will only be saying "good bye"
        for&nbsp; a little while for those who go, and welcoming as many more
        over there.

        We all attended Easter services yesterday, and with more than one
        hundred churches in the city, there was not even standing room in many
        of them for all who came. St. Petersburg is certainly a church going
        city, which has been very much disturbed recently over the question of
        Sunday observance. By the votes of the people last week it was carried
        three to one in favor of closed theaters, races and other amusements on
        the Sabbath day. It is not <span class="UL">all</span> money and real
        estate here, for the majority of the people are in favor of a clean
        christian<span class="Annotation">.[sic]</span> city.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have been looking for brother <a href=
        "CampbellWilliam1864.html">Will</a> and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I905">
        Louise</a>, and hope yet to have them with us to celebrate April 12th.
      </p>

        Sister Kate and <a href=

        Lish</a> are on their way home from the Pacific Coast where they have
        spent a very anxious<sup>1</sup> but pleasant winter. We shall be glad
        to find them home when we get there, which will be soon after the snow
        and zero weather of the North is over.
      </p>
      <p>
        We miss <a href=

        Helen</a> an the rest at home and wish you might all migrate South
        winters where they always have flowers and birds. It is not unusual to
        hear the mocking birds singing at two or three o'clock in the morning.

        Last fall I was in the Arnot-Ogden Hospital<sup>2</sup> for some time,
        but with the divine strength given me and the wonderful skill of Cousin
        Dr. <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1577">
        Ross Loop</a>, I am quite myself again. The many gifts, flowers,
        letters, cards and calls from dear relatives and friends will never be
        forgotten. They are a wonderful tonic at such a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We shall anxiously wait for the next edition of letters from our one
        hundred Cousins, - many many thanks, Cousin Will, for your untiring
        efforts in making such a plan possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        With best wishes and much love to all,
