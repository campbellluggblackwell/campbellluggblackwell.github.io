      <p>Dear Campbell Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> As I was sweeping this morning I ran across the letter from Cousin <a

          href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1505">Roswell
          Young</a>. I had not known that I was to be included in this Cousins
        Club. I was very glad to receive one of the volumes of "cousins letters"
        which my brother, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1448">Ross
          Van Dusen</a>, brought to me. Many thanks to Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">William
          Selph</a>, I have spent many happy moments reading the letters. It
        seems as if I were acquainted with all the cousins after reading the
        letters, although there are a great many of them whom I have never seen.</p>
      <p> We live on a farm, and I have lots of work to do, so letter writing
        looks like a big task. </p>
      <p> Well, I guess that I have said enough for this time. I promise to do
        better next time. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Closing">
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
    </div>
