    <br>
    <big><big><big>There are many intermarriages throughout the generations, but
          here are the early connections. There's lots of overlap in the family
          trees. Below are selected parts of the trees: first from the
          CAMPBELLs' viewpoint; then from the LUGG perspective; BLACKWELLs'
          next; then from the HAZLETT perspective. For simplicity, only the
          children that "interconnect" are shown. "Sr." and "Jr." were not
          usually used as part of the names below, but are added to help
          distinguish father from son, where both have the same name. <br>
          <br>
          [Note the longevity of many of these folks. Infant and child mortality
          was high, but for those who reached adulthood, a surprising percent
          lived to "ripe old age".]</big><br>

      <big>We haven't been able to trace our Campbells farther back than Joseph
        Campbell, born 1748 in Scotland, died 1822 in Nelson, Tioga Co., PA and
        his brother, <a href="CampbellJohn1761.html">John Campbell</a>, born
        Apr 3, 1761 in Scotland, died Mar 20, 1855, in Nelson. We do not know
        where in Scotland they were born, nor where in Scotland Mary Harper was
        born. <br>
        <br>
        John Campbell (b. 1761) was the apparently first of the family to come
        to America, probably in 1776. He worked as a tailor in Philadelphia and
        later as a land agent. Next to come were some of Joseph's older
        children. They initially settled in Lancaster Co., PA. We don't know
        exactly when they arrived, but Sam and Sally Campbell Hazlett's first
        child, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I38">Archibald</a>,
        was born in Lancaster Co. in 1803. Joseph Campbell, wife Mary Harper,
        and their younger children lived in N. Ireland for about 10 years before
        sailing from Londonderry to Perth Amboy, NJ in 1810.<br>
        <br>
        John Campbell married a widow, <a href="LuggSarah1777ca.html">Sarah
          LUGG</a> Clinch Blackwell in 1818. Sarah Lugg was born in Bisley,
        Gloucestershire, abt. 1777. Sarah first married <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I20">Thomas
          Clinch</a> and had a daughter, <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann
          Clinch</a>, b. 1804 in Avening, Gloucestershire. In 1804 Sarah, Thomas
        and infant Ann sailed from Bristol to Philadelphia. On board was a
        widower, <a href="BlackwellEnoch1764ca.html">Enoch Blackwell</a> (also
        from Avening, born there about 1764) his children, and several of his
        siblings. In 1805, Thomas Clinch died in NYC of yellow fever. Soon
        after, Sarah and Enoch married. According to Ann's daughter <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Jane
          CAMPBELL Tubbs</a> (1834 - 1916), Ann was given to Enoch's brother <a
          href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2682">Peter
          Blackwell</a> and raised near New Hope, PA. But the late <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2956">Stella
          MAUGERI Blackwell</a>, a Blackwell family researcher, believed Ann was
        raised by brother <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2677">Joshua
          Blackwell</a>, not Peter.<br>
        <br>
        Sarah and Enoch lived in Lycoming Co., PA, where their two children were
        born: <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary Blackwell</a> in 1806, and
        <a href="BlackwellEnoch1814.html">Enoch</a> in 1814. Enoch "Sr." died in
        1816. After Sarah married John Campbell in 1818 and John, Sarah, Mary,
        and Enoch "Jr." lived in Nelson. In 1821 Sarah decided two of John's
        nephews would make good husbands for her daughters. She wrote to Ann
        Clinch, inviting her to come to Nelson to marry <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph
          Campbell</a> "Jr." Daughter Mary Blackwell married <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James

      <big>The elder Enoch Blackwell's tree is embedded in the LUGG tree above,

        7 children, at least 5 of whom came to America with Enoch. Enoch was
        from a family of 10 children. At least 3 of his siblings came to
        America: <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2636">Thomas</a>,

        We have several generations of Enoch's ancestry. Enoch "Sr." was Sarah
        Lugg's 2nd husband, and had two children by her: Mary Blackwell (who
