<big><big>[Note:</big></big> <big><big>Wm. Hoyt was a Private in Co. H,

      copied by William and Phebe's granddaughter, <span wc_id="I1250">
      Jessica HOYT</span> Thompson, perhaps in the 1950s, and transcribed by her
      son, William Thompson. We tried to preserve the original grammar and
      spelling, which was somewhat erratic. Jessica wrote the following comment
      on her copy:<br/></big></big>

<big><big>"This must have been written right after he got in the army.
      After awhile there was not an able bodied man left on all the farms of
      Farmington Hill <span class="Annotation">[in Farmington Twp., Tioga Co.,
      PA-wbt]</span> except one 'simple minded' (as my grandmother always said)
      giant who went from one family to another and did their grains, cut down
      trees for wood, etc. that the women couldn't do. My grandfather was in
      the Army of the Potomac which spent months just camping in the Washington
      army amid need &amp; disease waiting to fight. One of his letters tells
      how so many of the homesick young soldiers deserted that winter that they
      had this big hanging &amp; all the Companies were called to watch it. He
      also told toward the last when they were in Virginia of hundreds of
      rebels giving up hope and deserting after the North took Petersburg, etc.
      Am going to see if I can decipher some more letters &amp; if I do will
      give you copies."</big></big>

       <br/>
      Dear wife and baby,<br/></big></big>
</p>
<p>
<big><big>Once more I am seated in my cabin with my pencil in hand to
      write your answer to your much loved letter. I am well at present &amp;
      hope this will find you as well as I. You may think it strange that I
      write every time with pencil but it is a hard matter to have ink here
      &amp; when we do it is a hard matter to keep them. I bought me a
      portfolio to keep my papers &amp; envelopes in. I was down to the
      hospital this morning and about eight thousand men sick and wounded. You
      can not put down your finger without you will find some one in
      there.<br/></big></big>
</p>
<p>
<big><big>I got you and <a href="HoytJosephD1860.html">Joe</a>'s picture
      yesterday which made me think of home. There will not be many days that I
      shall not see it, the picture. I think Joe's looks more natural than
      yours. I have heard nothing of my photographs since I left Harrisburg but
      hope to get them soon. You said the water in the well was bad. You must
      get some one to draw the water out &amp; clean it out then I think it
      will be good again. You must keep Joe away from the well. You must not
      let anyone draw wood off the farm except Sam without Rogers wants to draw
      once in a while for logs. Tell me what Beever [sic] is going to do and
      how Mary is getting along and all the particulars. I want you to let Sam
      work the land. We have not seen Jim Simonds yet. John paid me the money
      on that note in Harrisburg and I wrote him a receipt. You had better keep
      the old rooster and kill the young ones and eat them. I would not want
      those ten roosters. Your geese you had better kill and save the feathers
      &amp; sell that [illegible] to Lug [sic] as soon as it gets old
      enough.<br/></big></big>
</p>
<p>
<big><big>You say you think that I am home sick. I  would give
      anything to see you &amp; Joe but I dare not get home sick for a minute.
      You must not worry about me for I have a good place. I have been detailed
      to go with the Doctors so I have no shooting to do. I have it very easy.
      You must not work so hard. You had better get some boy that you can trust
      to do the chores. You must be careful of yourself. When I draw my pay I
      will send you the money and you must pay Stanton. I will tell you more
      about it next time. See <span wc_id="I1726">
      E. Knapp</span> and get that money from his note. Write as soon as you get
      this and tell me all.<br/></big></big>
