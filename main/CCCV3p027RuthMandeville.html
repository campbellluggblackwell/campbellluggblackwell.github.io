      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> This is my first letter and you'll probably hope it will be the last
        when I tell the happenings in our family during the past year - it will
        sound like a medical journal. </p>
      <p> To plunge right in - <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1544">mother</a>
        had the misfortune to fracture her hip twelve weeks ago; but, aided by
        her usual indomitable courage, is recovering rapidly. </p>
      <p> <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1545">Pearl</a>
        was operated upon for goiter last November - and last Tuesday another
        operation, appendix this time, was necessary. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1552">Joe's
          wife</a> and I drove over to Auburn to see her and found her doing
        splendidly. </p>
      <p> <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1551">Joe</a>,
        <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1565">Jerome</a>
        and I are still intact. As a matter of fact, I had ordered the knives
        sharpened for the removal of my tonsils this month, when, at the crucial
        moment, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1563">Billy</a>,
        our older son, burst forth with chicken pox. Yesterday <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1564">David</a>
        acquired them.</p>
      <p> No matter whether it's a case of chicken pox or temper, when David
        does anything, he does it thoroughly. For the benefit of those who don't
        know, Billy, Jr. is six and a half years old, and David Campbell two and
        a half. Need I say that I am usually busy? </p>
      <p> This year <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1560">Bill</a>
        has carried the burden of our civic duties. He is on the Board of
        Education, has offices in several clubs and is always called on for
        active service in the city drives. I fear that most of my spare moments
        are spent, for my own pleasure, in reading. </p>
      <p>We would love to have any or all of the cousins come to see us. Cousin
        <a href="BuckMyra1884.html">Myra Buck</a> Seiders surprised me with a
        visit not long ago. Please follow her example.</p>
      <p>Love to all the cousins,</p>
    </div>
