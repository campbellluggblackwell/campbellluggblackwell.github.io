    <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AUNT JANE'S
        MEMORIES</span></h2>
    <div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"Tell us some tales, <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Aunt
          Jane</a>", we'd say,<br>
        "Of events that belong to a bygone day;<br>
        Of our ancestors of the Campbell Clan,<br>
        Try to remember all that you can."</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> </div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Then Aunt Jane would start reminiscing and
        tell<br>
        Her stories of folks whom you all know well;<br>
        And too, her memory would willingly rove<br>
        To the earlier days - and a treasure - trove<br>
        Of Interesting recollections we would hear<br>
        About the kin, both far and near.</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> </div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Genealogy? Yes, if we wanted to know<br>
        The date of birth of so-and-so,<br>
        Or when somebody married or someone "went home"<br>
        Or, when some Cousin did far away roam,<br>
        Aunt Jane would sit down on any summer's day<br>
        And spin her tales in her own quaint way;<br>
        So many things she could recall -<br>
        We wish now, we could remember them all.</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> </div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Aunt Jane, herself, was as "good as gold";<br>
        Of her, many stories could be told;<br>
        No one in need, she turned away;<br>
        She cared for the sick full many a day;<br>
        And both aged and young, she helped them too;<br>
        Many a kindly deed she'd do.<br>
        "The cup of cold water" she gladly gave<br>
        To help a troubled soul to save.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>_ _ _ _</h2>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p>Along "Memory Lane" we will now slowly walk<br>
        And hearken awhile to Aunt Jane's quaint talk.<br>
        These "Memoirs" that follow, with Scripture oft-quoted<br>
        Are well-worth some thought of their precepts thus noted. </p>
