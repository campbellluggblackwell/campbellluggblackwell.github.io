<div class="Salutation">
<p>
        My dear Cousins:-
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        For the very good reason given by Cousin <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">George Buck</a> in his circular letter, if for no
        other, we should all make a special effort to be on time with our
        letters. Not that an individual letter is so important but collectively
        they mean a lot.
      </p>
<p>
        Living as far away as we do from the old family hearth, and seldom
        hearing from you, we do through this medium of letters keep in very
        close touch with you, and possibly get more kick our of the letters
        than the majority of Cousins; for this selfish reason we trust that the
        efforts of the Officers will be rewarded with 100% results.
      </p>
<p>
        There has nothing of special importance in our family the past year;
        however we are looking forward with a great deal of pleasure to the
        arrival of a daughter in our family the coming summer.  <span wc_id="I908">
        Henry</span> has decided "it is not well for man to live alone" and he is
        going to wed a very charming <span wc_id="I909">
        young lady</span>, whose home is in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The announcement
        has been made so I am not giving away family secrets. <span wc_id="I916">
        Bill</span> is in school in Ann Arbor, - will be home for Easter vacation
        soon.
      </p>
<p>
        We have had very little Florida weather here since October and are
        beginning to long for green grass and flowers to take the place of snow
        and ice.
      </p>
<p>
        The tragic death of <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil Young</a> was a
        shock to us and must have been to you all.
      </p>
<p>
<span wc_id="I905">
        Louise</span> joins with me in wishing you health and happiness. With much
        love,
      </p>
