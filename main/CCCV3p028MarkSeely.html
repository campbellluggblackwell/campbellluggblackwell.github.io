    <div class="Salutation">
      <p>Dear Cousins of the Campbell Family:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>Greetings to one and all.</p>
      <p> <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a> says it is time to
        write our annual letter. I wonder if he does not get tired and, perhaps
        a little disgusted, that he has to keep us posted as to when to write
        each time. Well, he is pretty good natured if he doesn't and that is the
        way I remember him. </p>
      <p> Will says "Write a bright, cheerful, newsy letter". Can you imagine
        any one being able to write a very newsy letter from the little town of
        Nelson? My life has been a very quiet, and to some, would seem a very
        dull life; but I think I have been too busy to realize it. When all is
        well in the store and house, I am very happy and contented. </p>
      <p> I guess I was not intended to do big things. I have been very proud of
        my cousins, one and all. Some have seen much of the world, and from them
        I gain a knowledge of the world at large. Others have plodded on in much
        the same quiet way as myself, and from them I gain courage to go on and
        be contented. So each one plays his part in life, exerting an influence
        on all with whom he comes in contact. </p>
      <p> Cousin Will has given us the pleasure of expecting to hear from some
        new members of the Cousin Clan. We are very glad, and extend a cordial
        welcome. We shall all be very sorry to miss Cousin <a href="CraneJennie1852.html">Jennie
          Bosard</a>'s good letter, also Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1448">Ross
          Van Dusen</a>'s. </p>
      <p> <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I981">Emily</a>
        and family are well, and doing well, and come home once a year with two
        nice grandsons, and that is always a bright spot in our lives. <a href="SeelyLena1873.html">Lena</a>
        is always with us, and though not very strong, is getting to be our
        "right hand man" in our old age. </p>
      <p>We shall look forward to the coming of the new Cousins Book with
        pleasure.</p>
