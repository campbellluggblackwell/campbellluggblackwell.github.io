<p>
        Dear Relatives of the Campbell Clan:-
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        It certainly gives me much pleasure to be able to add a few words of
        greeting to each one of this great family, and to converse with you in
        this manner. While many changes have occurred in some of the homes
        represented by these letters, others of the family have flowed along in
        smooth and uneventful ways. This has been the case in my Immediate
        family, nothing of any importance having transpired during the past
        year to break the change in our lives.<sup>1</sup> But on April 12th,
        will occur an event which I never expected to see, - our Fiftieth
        Wedding Anniversary, at which time we will keep open house to greet our
        friends. And how much I would like to grasp your hands and welcome you
        all to our home at this particular time! We are very fortunate to have
        sister <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">Mary Shipman</a> and her
        daughter <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel</a> and her husband
        <span wc_id="I773">
        Llewellyn Shaw</span> with us at this time; both of our daughters with
        their families live here and can help us to make merry on this
        memorable day. We have many Pennsylvania friends who will also be with
        us on this occasion. We are not growing old but younger in this warm
        sunny clime and life looks as sweet and good now, as it did fifty years
        ago; time passes quickly and the hours are golder as we pause to think
        of the future, we wonder what it has in store for us. We are certainly
        blessed with good health and have all our family and a good home and
        lots of lovely friends, with the privilege of living in a city of
        continual sunshine and a bright outlook ahead. What more can one wish
        for? We have regrets when we think of past opportunities where we might
        have done more good in many ways, but what is past is gone forever.
      </p>
<p>
        Our little grandson, <span wc_id="I1705">
        Bobbie Mitchell</span>, has been ailing for about a month and for the past
        two weeks has been very ill when blood poison developed; we have been
        very much concerned over his condition but now we think he is coming
        along finely and will be up and about in a week or so.
      </p>
<p>
        Daughter <span wc_id="I1703">
        Ruth Mitchell</span> wishes me to say she has her heart and hands full and
        cannot even find time to think about writing a Cousins letter so she
        will have to be excused this time with a good wish and hearty greetings
        to each one of her relatives of the Campbell Clan.

        1. Only a few months later, the Florida real estate "bubble" burst.
        Tommie was a large scale developer who owned many acres of land and had
        invested large sums into providing streets, water, sewer, etc. ---
        eventually having to donate the land to the city as Campbell Park when
        the demand for new houses suddenly evaporated.

        While we were North last summer we saw Cousin <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil Young</a> in Elmira; how well he looked and
        was so jolly and gave us such a hearty greeting that when the word came
        of his tragic death we were so shocked we could not believe it. How
        uncertain life is after all!
      </p>
<p>
        We were saddened to hear of the sudden passing away of brother <span wc_id="I836">
        Will Ellison</span> and that same day came the message of the untimely
        death of my nephew, <span wc_id="I1709">
        Gordon Parks</span>; these sorrows of our families unite us closer to each
        other and remind us that life is fleeting What a blessing that time is
        a healer of sorrow, else what unhappy lives we would live.
      </p>
<p>
        We enjoy many pleasures in the privilege of having so many of our
        Northern friends and relatives living here a part of the time. <span wc_id="I1595">
        Treva Hooker</span> Hazlett and <span wc_id="I666">
        her husband</span>; they arrived here last week. John is much improved in
        health and delighted with St. Petersburg and its wonderful climate
        which at this time is about perfect; our warm balm salt air gives one
        new life and makes one want to enjoy it indefinitely.
      </p>
<p>
        Easter Sunday was as perfect a day as one ever saw; it seemed as though
        the Divine Maker had put the finishing touches on "A Perfect Day".
        Thousands of people were out to enjoy themselves each in his or her own
        way; our beaches were thronged with people, - hundreds enjoying the
        salt water swimming in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, - while
        others were enjoying the beautiful orange and grape fruit <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> groves inhaling the sweet perfume of the
        blossom laden trees. All nature seems alive and it is grand to live and
        be able to enjoy all the blessings God showers on his people in this
        glorious clime.
      </p>
<p>
        With many good wishes and much love to each one of my numerous
        relatives, I am,
      </p>
