        <h3>This Site</h3>
        <p class="FirstP"><a href="http://greenfreelibrary.newspaperarchive.com/">This
            website is for the descendants of one pioneer couple, </a><a href="CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph
            </a> and <a href="HarperMary1749.html">Mary Harper </a> Campbell;
          and of associated families --- especially HAZLETTs, LUGGs and
          BLACKWELLs. They now have 10 generations of descendants. Our family
          tree now contains over 24,000 individuals, with more than 4,500
          surnames. Since the very beginning, our Campbells, Hazletts, Luggs and
          Blackwells have been intertwined. </p>
        <p> Enjoy exploring these pages, and be sure to contact us if you are a
          relative. We love hearing from "new" cousins we hadn't known of.</p>
        <p> [Cautionary note: Several different, unrelated, Campbell families
          came to Tioga Co., PA in the early 1800s. It's easy to get the various
          families mixed up. A few of us have ancestors in more than one of
          those Campbell lines.]</p>
        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p class="FirstP">Our story starts with Joseph Campbell (born 1748 in
          Scotland) and wife Mary Harper (born 1749 in Scotland) who lived for a
          while in County Antrim in North Ireland, the men reportedly worked at
          the Belfast Iron Works before coming to the US.</p>
        <p>They pronounced their name as "CAM-uhl" (like the cigarettes), not as
          "CAMP-bell" or "CAM-bul". (When the surname was created, almost 800
          years ago, it was spelled 'Cambell.')</p>
        <p> The first member of the family known to come to America was Joseph's
          younger brother <a href="CampbellJohn1761.html">John Campbell</a>, b.
          1761 in Scotland. He came about 1776 to Philadelphia, where he was
          first a tailor, and later a land agent.-</p>
        <p> The rest of our Campbells, the Hazletts, the Luggs, and the
          Blackwells immigrated in dribs and drabs over the years --- the
          last&nbsp; (Chas. B. Lugg &amp; family) in 1833.</p>
        <p> For a timeline and details, see <a href="WhoCameWhen.html"> Who
            Came When</a> (it covers Campbells, Hazletts, Luggs and Blackwells).</p>
        <p> By the very early 1800s, some of Joseph and Mary's older children
          had settled in Lancaster Co., PA. Their oldest son, <a href="CampbellJohn1781.html">John
            Campbell</a> (b. 1781) soon moved to the Pittsburgh area. Eldest
          daughter <a href="CampbellSarah1777.html">Sally </a> and son-in-law,
          <a href="HazlettSamuel1780.html">Sam Hazlett </a>, by 1806 may have
          moved from Lancaster Co. to a farm near Stroudsburg, PA. By 1810 Sam
          Hazlett, Joseph Campbell and the elder John Campbell completed land
          purchases in <a href="BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's Island</a>.
          Joseph and Mary Harper Campbell, plus their younger children, came to
          the US in the fall of 1810. </p>
        <p> Probably in late 1810, Joseph and Mary, accompanied by 5 of their 8
          children; 2 of their 3 Hazlett sons-in-law; Joseph's brother John; and
          their livestock migrated from son-in-law Sam Hazlett's farm in PA's
          Monroe Co. (or perhaps Lancaster Co.) to Beecher's Island. Stories
          about their epic journey were recorded by granddaughter-in-law <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I661">Lucy
            DUNHAM</a> Hazlett. </p>
        <p> The Campbells and Hazletts were among the first permanent settlers
          in the area. They rapidly multiplied. <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James</a>
          and <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary Blackwell</a> Campbell
          apparently had 13. <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph</a> and <a
            href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann Clinch</a> Campbell had 12 children. <a
            href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John</a> and <a href="CampbellJane1792.html">Jane
            Campbell Hazlett</a> had 9. Sam and Sally Campbell Hazlett had 7. So
          they quickly populated a community and filled a school house.</p>
        <p> In 1894, <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">Phebe CAMPBELL</a> Hoyt
          organized the first Campbell Reunion (they liked to spell it
          "Re-union'). The reunions were held annually for 50 years. At their
          peak, more than 300 attended, including many Blackwells and Luggs.
          They were halted in WW2, but restarted in 2000 by Phebe's
          great-grandson, Bill Thompson. One branch of the family (Joseph and
          Ann Clinch Campbell's line) found the reunions too big, and held
          separate Campbell Cousins Dinners, which were by invitation only, and
          primarily for the 21 first cousins who were Joseph and Ann's
          grandchildren. They had grown up together, and felt a strong bond to
          each other. Both events were held yearly, almost always near Nelson.
          Many of the Cousins Dinner attendees were also active in the
          "Re-unions". </p>
        <p> We have a wonderful repository of our family's history: The minutes
          of the Campbell Reunions; minutes of the Campbell Cousins Diners;
