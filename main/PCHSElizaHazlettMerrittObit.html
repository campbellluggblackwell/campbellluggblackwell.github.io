        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another of the pioneers of Nelson and
        vicinity has passed away. On the 19th of December we followed
        the remains of <a

          Merritt</a> to the grave. Just eleven weeks after, at the same
        hour of the day, we tenderly and lovingly laid the remains of
        his wife by his side. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliza Hazlett Merritt was the daughter of <a
          href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John Hazlett</a> and <a
          href="CampbellJane1792.html">Jane Campbell</a> Hazlett. Her
        parents were of Scotch descent and came from the North of
        Ireland. They were the parents of ten children. Three died
        young, five grew up to manhood and womanhood, married and
        brought up families. Three daughters are still living, the
        others have gone before. The living sisters are Mrs. <a

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliza A. Hazlett was born March 20, 1825, and
        died March 4, 1899, at the age of seventy-three years, eleven
        months and four days. She was married to William Merritt, June
        21, 1848. They were spared to each other fifty years, five
        months and twenty-six days. Mrs. Merritt was born and lived in
        Nelson all her life. Perhaps the typesetter left out a sentence
        about deceased children.] The others are all living, namely: <a

          Hall</a>. The son and daughters were untiring in their efforts
        to promote the comfort and welfare of their parents. Mrs.
        Merritt was a great sufferer for many years. She was a faithful
        wife, a kind and loving mother, a good neighbor and everyday
        Christian.She united with the Presbyterian church in Nelson,
        February 1st, 1845. Thirty-four others united with the church at
        the same time, ten of whom are now living. The meeting was held
        at her father's house, now the residence of <a

        that time. The pioneers of Nelson are passing away, only two or
        three are now left. <br>
