    <div class="Salutation">
      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> It is now the time for another letter from the Cousins of the <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph
          Campbell</a> Family, -- that we may all know the hopes and fears of
        the Cousins and that we may all have a general knowledge of the
        prosperity or ill-luck of each and every family.<br>
      </p>
      <p> It has always pleased us all to have every member of the family
        prosper and to become an honor not only to themselves but to add an
        honor to the name of Campbell, in payment to Joseph and <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann</a>
        for their conscientious way of living -- that their children and
        grandchildren by looking back to them would try and lead exemplary
        lives, -- a thing which has been done in every family and is now a great
        source of happiness to all, so the letters we have already received tell
        no other story.</p>
      <p> It has been surprising that so many letters have been written but what
        a pleasure it is to sit down and have a visit with our dear friends
        through a letter as it tells the whole story without asking questions
        and we hear from all, thanks to Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will
          Selph</a> for thinking out the plan.</p>
      <p> My home has been in Nelson for the fifty-eight years and I am still
        working in the same old store. I do not think you would advise me now to
        make a change of location. My health is quite good and when I am busy I
        forget about my old age which must soon face. My <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I973">wife</a>
        is my helper and we try to be equal to the task, -- but now we are
        careful to not add any new cares.</p>
      <p> We think of all our friends and relatives and wish them all a
        prosperous and happy year.</p>
      <p> <em></em><em></em>Certainly the new edition of Letters which will be
        published in April will be an oasis in our lives.</p>
