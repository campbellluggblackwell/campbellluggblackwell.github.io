      <p>This website is for the descendants of 3 intertwined families — <strong>Campbells,
          Luggs &amp; Blackwells</strong>, all of whom are connected to Nelson,
        Tioga Co., PA. There are now more than 10 generations of descendants, at
        least 10,000 living — many of whom are not aware of their connection. We
        want to facilitate reconnecting — and getting to know one another while
        reconnecting with our roots.</p>
      <p> We started as a RootsWeb mail list in the 1980s. Then added a family
        tree on RootsWeb’s WorldConnect pages. In 2000 we re-instituted a
        Campbell Reunion in the Nelson, PA area — (the reunion had long had Lugg
        and Blackwell participation). We created, and continue to add to, a
        family history website that has more than 500 hundred pages of photos,
        old letters, news-clips, diagrams and info on people and places in our
        past. We created a Facebook group, which at the moment has about 300
        members. We’re migrating our family tree data to a huge, shared tree, on
        WikiTree.com and have added more then 5,700 people to WikiTree so far.</p>
      <p>Last year we created our own YouTube channel. And, because of the
        COVID-19 pandemic, held our first video-conferenced reunion (via
        ZOOM).&nbsp; And we're about to launch our own blog. Explore our past -
        and our present.</p>
