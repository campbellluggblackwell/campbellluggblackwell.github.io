      <h2>Minutes of the 2020 Campbell Reunion</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the 60th Campbell Reunion was held on
          August 1, 2020 via ZOOM. Attendees participated from their homes via
          the Internet and their computers or phones. This was the first time
          that we have held a virtual reunion, but it went relatively smoothly,
          and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves.</p>
        <p> <b>Attendees:</b> Marylyn Dewey Adams (FL), Anne Alexander (PA),
          Linda Blacksmith (PA), David Buck (NY), Jane Chapman (PA), Peggy
          Chilson (KS), Sally Fliess (CT), George Gibson (NY), <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Johnson-81799">Betsy
            Gorman </a>(NY), Jean Hazlett (VA), Walter Hazlett VA), Alan
          Jacobus (MI), Bonnie Kyofski (PA), John Morton (BC), Lori Nelson (TX),
          Betty Phillips (FL), Barbara Righter (WA), <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-1680">Bill
            Thompson</a> (PA), Mary Lilley-Thompson (PA), Judy Thompson (GA),
          and Michael Whitehead (AZ).</p>
        <p> The reunion commenced at 1:00 pm, conducted by Pres. Betsy Gorman,
          and everyone took turns introducing themselves, telling where they
          were from and how they are connected to the Campbells, Luggs and/or
          Blackwells. After introductions, Cousin Peggy Chilson sang a
          delightful rendition of the song, “As Time Goes By”, accompanied by
          her friend, Jeff Wilkins.</p>
        <p><b> Appointment of Acting Secretary:</b><br>
          Since no one volunteered for the position, it was decided that minutes
          would be taken from the video recording of the reunion.</p>
        <p> <b>Presentation.</b><br>
          Bill Thompson gave us a presentation about four great ways we can
          connect with our family history via the Internet: our website,
          WikiTee, Facebook and YouTube. </p>
        <p> We first looked at our website, <a href="https://CampbellLuggBlackwell.com">
            https://CampbellLuggBlackwell.com</a>. It contains over 500 pages of
          documents, mini-biographies, photos, and so much more – including the
          four Campbell Cousins Correspondence books. The website has a search
          engine, so that one can look up documents associated with a name,
          place, etc. Marylyn mentioned that the website represents many years
          of work by Bill, which is very much appreciated. Bill stated that the
          information came from many people, and the main sources are listed on
          the site’s homepage. Also, he is always looking for volunteers to help
          index webpages, etc. </p>
        <p>Bill then took us to the WikiTree site entry points: </p>
        <ul class="w3-ul">
          <li> for Campbells - <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Campbell-31750">
              https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Campbell-31750</a></li>
          <li> for Luggs - <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Lugg-189">
              https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Lugg-189</a></li>
          <li>for Blackwells - <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-2569">https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-2569</a></li>
          <li>for others - <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Special:SearchPerson">https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Special:SearchPerson</a></li>
        </ul>
        where a great deal of information on our family tree reslides. This is a
        free website, maintained by hundreds of thousands of volunteers. Bill
        has been transferring our tree to this website from the old RootsWeb
        site, as RootsWeb has made changes to its platform that have made it
        less user-friendly and dependable.
        <p></p>
        <p>Next, Bill showed us our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/288505907846514">Facebook
            Group Page</a> (https://www.facebook.com/groups/288505907846514). In
          addition to reading posts and updates from group members on that page,
          we can access many photos and files of interest that have been
          uploaded (look for "the <i>more</i> menu item and "files"or
          "media"under that). And lastly, Bill took us to the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8qACUxzq1uBy8oA_DbHtmQ?view_as=subscriber">YouTube
            page</a>
          (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8qACUxzq1uBy8oA_DbHtmQ?view_as=subscriber),
          where we can find uploaded videos, which will include a video of this
          reunion.</p>
        <p><b>Approval of 2018 Meeting Minutes:</b> Copies of the 2018 Reunion
          minutes had previously been emailed to attendees, and no one asked
          that they be read aloud. George Gibson moved to accept the minutes,
          Sally Fliess seconded, and all approved. </p>
        <p><b>Recognitions:</b> Though not officially mentioned, our oldest
          attendee was Jane Chapman, who has attended every reunion since they
          were restarted in 2000.</p>
        <p> <b>Remembrances:</b><br>
          <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Buck-5991">George W. Buck</a> –
          George passed away almost two years ago at 95, and his son, David,
          said that George always remembered his Elmira roots. </p>
        <p><a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Pearson-11085">Anne Pearson</a>
          Lugg – Anne passed away earlier this year due to COVID. Bill mentioned
          how helpful and generous she was with sharing family history, and many
          others shared nice memories of Anne. </p>
        <p><a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Phillips-43057">Larry Phillips</a>
          – Betty let us know that her husband passed away just a few weeks ago
          from COVID. He had come down with it while in a nursing home. </p>
        <p><b>Remarks:</b> We had a lively and interesting discussion about how
          attendees were related, and we shared some family stories. Betty told
          about “Old Man Lugg” and his new car – the first gas-driven vehicle in
          Knoxville. After running it into her father’s store, Lugg ended up
          selling the car to her father. But the engine was gravity fed, so the
          car had to be driven backwards in order to get up the local hills!
          Also, Michael Whitehead, who attended from Arizona, was pleased to
          find many cousins from the PA/NY side of his family.</p>
        <p><b>Election of Officers:</b> Bill put together a potential slate.
          Bill offered to be President, and Betsy offered to be Secretary. Bill
          had a potential VP candidate, Lori Chilson Gagnon. Michael motioned to
          approve the slate, Betty seconded, and all approved. Bill also thanked
          George Gibson for being our unofficial IT tech person! </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>New Business:</b> Michael asked who was still living in the Twin
          Tiers area, as he may come for a visit. Bonnie Kyofski mentioned that
          the Nelson Cemetery is worth a visit. It is currently in great shape,
          largely due to the efforts of Cousin Kay Chilson Miller.</p>
        <p>The business meeting was adjourned at 2:30pm.</p>
        <p><b>Entertainment:</b> Peggy Chilson sang three more songs for us,
          which was a really nice treat. Thank you, Peggy! </p>
        <p><b>Cousins Conversations:</b> The meeting continued on informally for
          another 30-40 minutes, and the ZOOM meeting ended at 3:30pm.</p>
        <p> Minutes respectfully submitted by Betsy Gorman, Secretary</p>
