    <p>Though dead he yet speaketh. Dear
          children, to you who hath heard him proclaim the glad word, repent of
          your sins for days are but few. You will soon meet at the bar of your
          God.</p>

          Father united with the Presbyterian Church in boyhood. His admonition
          has been heeded by some of us. He gave his children to God in baptism,
          in faith believing that all would eventually be brought into the fold
          of Christ and be united family in Heaven above. He said, "Here I am
          and these children that God has given me". Father was precept and
          example. His picture hangs on the wall of my parlor. I look upon his
          dear face and say, "Line upon line, and precept upon precept." I never
          knew the time he did not say Grace at the table and have family
          prayer. As age crept on his eyes began to fail. He would have the
          children read a chapter of their own selection. <a href="CampbellEleanor1828.html">Eleanor</a>'s
          turn came to read, and she selected a chapter in Proverbs which read,
          "A time to Dance". She thought that would soften his benediction on
          dancing. He was very much opposed to our dancing. I remember the first
          time I ever danced. It was at Morris Brooks' to an applecut.<sup>1</sup> I know I
          trembled in every limb, - I was disobeying father. I don't think I had
          any other fears. I have a shamed face for it yet.</p>

          Steadman Bottom introduced the violin into Church. Father, <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">Uncle
            James</a>, and <a href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">Uncle John Hazlett</a>
          left the church, I guess they had forgotten what David said about
          praising God with stringed instruments.</p>
          <p>
          Father was never sued; had one note, sold; raised a large family and
          died out of debt. "Children are an inheritance from the Lord", We read
          that they are a defence <span style="font-style: italic;">[sic]</span>
          in old age. Father was blessed with a goodly number of them. "O God,
          thou hast taught me from my youth, and I have declared thy wondrous
          works to this generation. Now that I am old and gray-headed, forsake
          me not until I have shown thy strength that it may reach from
          generation to generation."</p>
          <p>
          Father was 70 years and 17 days old. Said he was living on borrowed
          time. "What wait I for, my hope is in thee?"</p>
          <p>
          Father adhered to the Commandments so strictly he thought it was wrong
          to have his picture taken. He was introduced into an art gallery; the
          artist stole the march</p></div>

      <p>1. Pioneer social events included barn raisings, quilting bees, cornhusking 
      parties -- and applecutting. They would not have been able to can apples, applesauce 
      or applebutter, so presumably they would sun dry apple slices and use them later 
      for pies, Apple Betty, etc. Old pictures show a room 
      full of bushels of apples, women with knives, and tables piled with apple slices. 
      Communities then had little social activity, except for going to church. Apparently 
      applecutting gatherings were often followed by dancing.</p>

          on him so we got his picture. Do not infer from
          what I have said that he had no faults. Let us gather up memories of
          his virtues, and pass by his shortcomings. He was very charitable; as
          flowers and vines cover the rough places in nature; so he covered the
          faults and failings of others with the mantle of charity. He was
          hospitable; turned none empty away. He said "Entertain Strangers, for
          be so doing we entertain angels unawares," Think not to say within
          ourselves, "We have Abraham to our Father"; because our parents were
          Puritans, that won't save the posterity. We must stand or fall for
          ourselves. </p></div>

          Parents struggle very hard to let their sons and daughters go to
          school in winter. In summer they must help work to earn their living.
          Now the sons and daughters are brought up to think that farm life is
          not high enough for them. They are educated for something higher. If
          not sent from home for education they grow at home with little other
          object than to have a good time. The daughters, if at home, are
          drumming on an organ or piano. If you would search the county records
          and see the borrowed money and mortgages to secure it, given by the
          father, you would not wonder that the farmers of today are crying
          "Hard Times".</p>

          Father was always a staunch Republican. Fifty years ago this fall Polk
          was elected President. A delegation went by our house to a mass
          meeting. <a href="HarperMary1749.html">Grandmother</a> was there. She
          waved her apron and hurrahed for Polk. Vest Peck sang, <p>

      <p>You see the children of those early settlers had everything
          alright but education as children have the opportunity of getting it
          today.</p>
          <p>
          I don't remember <a href="CampbellJoseph1748.html">grandfather</a>
          but remember a rail he was splitting; his last work on earth. He left
          two wedges in it. Father said to us children not to knock them out.
          When the log began to rot he got them and laid them up in the house.</p>

          Wheeler Hubble supplied the surrounding country with half bushels, -
          Billy Cook with spinning wheels; McCullum and Place with shoes and
          boots. They would go from house to house. The farmers would buy their
          leather at the tannery. Each child had two pairs, cow hide and calf
          skin. Girls, our best shoes were bound calf skin. We thought
          they were nice. If you could have seen us prepared for church on the
          Sabbath you would have thought father kept a shoe store.</p>
          <p>
          The first preacher I can remember was Orin Johnson, an old bachelor.
          The first tomatoes ever raised in this county he raised in father's
          garden back of the log house. He had no trouble keeping us children
          from eating them for the vines smelled so bad. Father raised a small
          patch of potatoes at the foot of Boon Hill. <a href="CampbellElizabeth1830.html">Sister
            Lib</a>, <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">Phoebe</a>, and myself
          dug and carried them in a basket and deposited them in a dugout under
          the floor. Grandmother would have us rest and taught us the 23rd
          Psalm; - The Lord is My Shepherd; - we learned the Commandments, the
          Beatitudes, Lord's Prayer, Shorter Catechisms, and the names of the
          books of the Old and New Testaments.</p>
