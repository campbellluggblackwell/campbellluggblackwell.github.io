        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        Another pleasure! Our Correspondence Club, -- and looking forward to
        the many nice letters we shall soon be reading.
      </p>
<p>
        Concerning our own little family, we are all well and busy as usual.
        Two lively boys, -- a few social affairs, -- the regular spring
        cleaning up, the same as there is in every home, keeps us on the job.
      </p>
<p>
         We will be looking for the folks<sup>1</sup> from Florida by June
        or before. Expect them to make their summer headquarters with us, and
        we want those who can, to come here to see them just as you used to do
        in Knoxville. When you are in this vicinity at least call us up on the
        telephone<sup>2</sup>.
      </p>
<p>
        We are fully enjoying these spring days and hope they last a long
        time. 
      </p>
<p>
        Wishing that this may find you all enjoying the best of health, and
        some of you enjoying new maple sugar, we send our best regards.<br/>
