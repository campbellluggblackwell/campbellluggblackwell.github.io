<font face="Courier, monospace"><font size="4">Dear Cousins:-<br/>
<br/>
               I want first to say that I am very glad that
          I belong to the Campbells even if it is only forty‑secondly. I still
          feel a pride in the fact.<br/>
<br/>
               I was never more thrilled in my life than
          the one time I met with you all there in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Township,_Tioga_County,_Pennsylvania">
          Nelson</a> and realized that all the good looking people around the
          tables were my relations. You people who have been able to meet year
          after year in that way have no idea what these letters mean to us,
          who are so far away and I think <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a> is doing a fine thing in
          keeping up the family love and pride by these letters.<br/>
<br/>
               I was a very small girl when we left Nelson
          for Brainerd, Minnesota, which was then the far West, as I know my
          poor <a href="VaughanEmma1854.html">Mother</a> felt then, but some of
          the impressions made before that on my childish mind have always
          remained. My dear <a href="CampbellSarah1824.html">Grandmother</a>,
          "Aunt Sally", as every one else called her, has always seemed a very
          real person to me, and I can see her yet, getting ready for church,
          putting a few peppermints in her pocket for me and a few cloves for
          herself; then the lovely walk down the road and through the old
          covered bridge, and then the visits among the relatives and friends.
          Reading over these letters has seemed almost like some of those
          visits where each one was mentioned and their joys and sorrows
          stared. I often wonder if we are not missing a great deal by not
          having more of these friendly visits. We of the West at least seem
          always in a hurry and must have something doing all the time.<br/>
<br/>
               The West is beautiful and I am sure there
          could never be any other home for me now. Our place which we have
          named "Firmond" is just about an hour's ride by ferry from Seattle,
          where my husband is employed in the Alaska Steamship Company offices,
          and where, by the way, we have a fine market for all our produce,
          said produce being mostly flowers. Our gardens today are still ablaze
          of color and I am sending in baskets of flowers every day. Roses are
          in bloom all down the path to the front gate while beyond the gate
          stretch the blue waters of Puget Sound. In the distance on the left
          are the snow capped Olympics and on the right the Cascades with old
          Mt. Ranier in their midst. Do you wonder we love it even in the rainy
          weather?</font></font>

<br/>
            We have had a very busy summer and many times
        have picked as many as two hundred bunches of sweet peas a day. I can
        pick thirty five bunches an hour,‑ that means about twelve hundred
        stems. The stems are about eight or ten inches long and four or five
        blooms on a stem, and the vines grow nine or ten feet high. I wonder if
        they grow like that in the East. Our greatest trouble, as I suppose it
        is with you, is to get help.<br/>
<br/>
             I was so interested in <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Cousin Tommie</a>'s letter because they too
        are on the ocean beach. It must be lovely there.<br/>
<br/>
            We take a little pleasure trip every now and
        then to Alaska which, by the way, I will say to all the Cousins is one
        of the finest trips in the world if one is not afraid of the water. So
        you see what in my childhood days was the "Far West" has become East to
        me; the prairies and lakes which I loved then have been supplanted by
        mountains and ocean.<br/>
<br/>
             We do miss the relatives; there are none of
        our own family here except our immediate family and I was delighted to
        know <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Cousin Kate</a>'s family were in
        Oregon. Come up some time. Perhaps some of you may come West some day
        and if you do, be sure to look up little old Harper and your country
        Cousins.<br/>
<br/>
             Am sorry we had no pictures to send; will try
        to get some finished in time but if not will put them in the next
        letter.<br/>
<br/>
             We will be more than glad to bear our portion
        of the expense attached to this Correspondence, and are looking forward
        to the next letter with great pleasure.<br/>
