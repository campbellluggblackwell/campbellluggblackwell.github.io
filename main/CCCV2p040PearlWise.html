      <p>Dear Cousins: </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>While in Elmira <span class="Annotation">[NY]</span> this fall, I
        enjoyed reading your letters so much, and thought at the time I would
        send one in too, but neglected it, so when <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin
          Will</a>'s letter came asking me to contribute this time, I was glad
        to do so.</p>
      <p>As most of you know, on August 21, 1923, I married <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I951">Frederick
          H. Wise</a>, a successful chiropractor of Auburn, N. Y., and September
        first, we moved here to out present home. We have one son, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1549">Henry
          Mowrey Wise</a>, ten years old, who is very much delighted with his
        new "Daddy."<sup>1</sup></p>
      <p> We have had a very pleasant winter and made many new friends. It was
        fortunate for me that my husband has been located here eight years.
        Auburn is in the heart of the Finger Lakes region, so I am sure some of
        you will be motoring this way this summer. Please be sure to look us up.
      </p>
      <p>I think the other members of the family are writing for themselves. I
        am sure it will be easier for us to all write one letter a year instead
        of two<sup>2</sup>. Next time, I will have some pictures too. </p>
      <p>With best wishes to all, I am</p>

    <div class="Footnote"><br>
      1. Pearl married her deceased husband's brother, so Frederick previously
      was Henry's uncle.<br>
      <br>
      2. Initially, Will Selph proposed 4 letters per year, but the Cousins
      would only agree to two per year --- which was done for 1923. But from
      then on, they decided one per year was enough.<br>
