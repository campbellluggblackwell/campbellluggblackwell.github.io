            <p>I could not have put this story of mine together in any sort of
              neat form without the help of many friends. I do not type. My dear
              friend, Marian Barnes, did type it. One night Colleen Thomas
              xeroxed it for me so I have several copies. Gerald Smith (Gerry)
              went shopping for me and got plastic covers and binders, so I can
              put the xeroxed copies together as "books." My sincere thanks to
              these dear friends. </p>

            <hr>
            <h3>WHAT HAVE I LEFT OUT?</h3>
            <p>Of course I belong to a family!</p>
            <p><a href="HugheyHerbert1857.html">My father</a> was the only son
              of <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hughey-1562">Daniel</a>
              and <a href="CampbellEliabeth1830.html">Elizabeth Hughey</a>. He
              had a brother who died in infancy.</p>
            <p>My father was Herbert Clinch Hughey. Clinch was his <span class="Annotation">[grand]</span>mother's
              maiden name. The Clinches were English people. I know little about
              them. They must have been fairly well to do for at one time a
              search was being made for anyone of the name Clinch, for there was
              an inheritance that was to be divided. My grandmother failed to
              make the proper connection, so, if she was entitled to anything it
              was never known.</p>
            <p>I say Clinch was my grandmother's name. That is not quite right.
              Instead it was only part of her name <span class="Annotation">[according
                to Elizabeth's death certificate her middle initial was 'B']</span>.
              The Clinch was her mother's name <span class="Annotation">[correct]</span>,
              so we remember the name Campbell instead, for <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">
                Ann Clinch</a> married <a href="CampbellJoseph1794.html">Joseph
                Campbell</a>. Her <span class="Annotation">[Mary's
                grandmother's]</span> name was Elizabeth. She evidently cared
              for the name, Clinch, for that name was given as a second name to
              my father, Herbert Clinch Hughey. </p>
            <p>The Campbells became a closely knit family. I remember hearing
              about the "Campbell Reunion" which was held every year. usually in
              that part of Pennsylvania where the family had lived. My father
              always hoped he might attend, but he never did.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"

                href="#Reunion"></a></p>
            <p>One well known cousin whom we came to know, for he came to see
              us, did attend every year. He was <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charles
                H. Congdon</a>, whose mother was my grandmother's sister.
              Charles H. Congdon<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#CharleyCongdon"></a>
              was one of the country's well known music leaders. C. H. Congdon
              made and published the Congdon Music Primers, used in many public
              schools. Charles also was the inventor of the <a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1306661">Congdon
                music pitch pipe</a> which was used by music leaders in schools
              or may music groups and probably still is. The Congdon pitch pipe
              may still be in music stores. Charles was the music leader for the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Party_%28United_States,_1912%29">Progressive
                Party</a> which met in Chicago for their convention. </p>
            <p>My mother was the third daughter of <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bixby-1157">Judson
                Amasa Bixby</a> and his wife <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Emner-3">Emner</a>.
              The Bixby daughters were <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bixby-1168">Mary</a>,
              <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bixby-1169">Martha</a>, <a

                href="BixbyHannah1863.html">Hannah</a>, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bixby-1170">Myrta</a>,
              <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bixby-1158">Minnie</a> and
              <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bixby-1171">Helen</a>.
              (Myrta and Minnie were twins.) Hannah Jennie Bixby married Herbert
              Clinch Hughey on Aug. 17, 1882. Four children were born to them: <a

                href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hughey-1582">Carrie May</a>,
              Sept. 8, 1883; <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hughey-1584">Judson
                Edgar</a>, Apr. 2, 1884; <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hughey-1584">Harry
                Milton</a>, Aug 17, 1893; Mary Estella, Sept. 21, 1899.</p>
            <p>The Bixby family "went back" to the days of the Revolutionary
              War, as the saying goes. Because of that genealogy, I was able to
              join the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) a chapter in
              Port Townsend, Washington, The Admiralty Island Chapter. </p>
            <p>Carrie May Hughey was married twice, first to <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Petersen-2195">John
                A. Peterson</a>, in 1906. The Petersons had two children, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Peterson-10786">John
                Edgar</a> and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Peterson-6107">Irma
                Margaret</a>. John lived only fourteen months. He died of
              pneumonia. He was a greatly adored baby, by the entire family.
              Irma taught school and she married <qa href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Anderson-42914">Hilding
                Anderson, April 11, 1942. Carrie divorced John Peterson and
                later married <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Taylor-55967">William
                  Lois Taylor</a>. The Taylors had one son, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Taylor-55969">William
                  Taylor</a>, born Nov. 27, 1914, who lives in Portland, Oregon.
                More about his family later. Carrie died Feb. 27, 1964. William
                Louis, born Aor. 17, 1855, died Oct. 20, 1930.</qa></p>
            <p>Judson Edgar Hughey, called "Edd" or "JE" married <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Spencer-18333">Anna
                Spencer</a> who had a claim near his in Montanta. Edd and Anna
              had two children, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hughey-1585">Elizabeth
                Lucile</a> (Betty Lu) and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hughey-1586">Donald
                Spencer</a>. Edd died May 22, 1970. Anna died June 9, 1972.
              Donald was shot and killed Dec. 6, 1974. Elizabeth (Betty Lu) died
              Sept. 13, 1990.</p>
            <p>Hary Milton Hughey married <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Rhodes-7428">Minnesota
                Rhodes</a>. Harry and Minnesota had three children, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hughey-1588">Harry
                Arden</a>, Roger Rhodes and Donna May. Harry died May 2, 1977.
              Minnie lives in a nursing home in Tacoma.</p>
            <p>Harry Arden married twice. Arden, as he was called, was killed by
              a train in 1975. Arden left two children (Roger and Cheryl) by his
              first wife, A<span class="Annotation">[r]</span>leen. </p>
            <p>Mary Hughey married Henry George Prescott June 10, 1930. They had
              no children. H. George, as he was called, died on March 4, 1975.</p>
            <p>So there's my family history in part. It seems I am the only one
              left. My sister, Carrie, and brothers, Edd and Harry, are gone as
              well as my <span class="Annotation">[first]</span> cousins. I am,
              therefore, "The Matriarch." I just <u>might live</u> to say "I've
              been in <u>three centuries"</u> for I am a very healthy old lady!
              My niece, Irma Anderson, lives near Brainerd, Minnesota. My
              brother Harry's children, Roger R. Hughey and his sister, Donna
              Lovrak, both live in Tacoma, Washington.</p>
            <p>William L. Taylor, Carrie's son, who lived in Portland, Oregon,
              died Feb. 20, 1993. He was married to Marie O'Hare, and they had
              three daughters, JoAnne, Patricia, and Rosemary, One of the great
              grand-daughters, Mary Jane Casssiato, Rosemary's daughter, has
              married a United States soldier, Johnathan Dinsmore, and has kept
              in close touch with me.</p>
            <p>Much of interest could be written in greater detail. For
              instance, Harry's granddaughter, the daughter of Donna Lovrak,
              desired to follow in her father's footsteps. I would so judge, for
              she enlisted in the United States Army. So, as a family, we would
              like to hear more about the life of our soldier girl, Laurie
              Lovrak. She writes very well, so we might hope for her annals.</p>
            <p>I know a little about my mother's sisters families. the Whites,
              the Davenports, the Murrays, and, yes, about the adopted of the
              Murrays, the Hepperleys and who ever.</p>
            <p>A dear friend just called me by telephone and talking to her
              reminded me of some things I should record.</p>
            <p>Years ago when George and I were first married we tried to be be
              encouraging to young people. It happened that one young Spanish
              youth at Manual school enjoyed coming to see us and he took to
              calling us "Dad" and "Mother." he finally started courting a fine
              girl. She was not Spanish, but, as we said in New Mexico, she was
              an "Anglo." He fell in love with her and married her. It was not
              long after they were married that he came to see me one day and
              said, "Mom, I think I have made a mistake. I am going to divorce
              Helen." I said, "Oh no, you can't do that. She's a nice young
              girl. since you married her, she is your responsibility. What are
              you going to do about that? |It startled him to consider that he
              had a responsibility toward her.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="w3-container w3-serif">
            <p>As to another telephone call I received today, from my dear
              friend, Nancy Stromme, who with her fine husband, Bruce, live not
              far from me here in Seattle. I remember when George and I gave our
              parlor or sitting room over to this same couple, in their courting
              days, and they became engaged in front of our Franklin stove. I
              laugh about these incidents and wonder if |I missed an opportunity
              to be a marriage counselor of note.</p>
            <p>George and I were never fortunate enough to have children, but we
              fairly frequently were able to care for our friends' children.
              Many young people called us"Uncle George and Aunt Mary" and still
              do.</p>
            <p>I am thinking there are several family incidents which could be
              told and retold. A few are humorous, others of special family
              interest, some sad as they relate to deaths.</p>
            <p>We always enjoyed hearing about Dad Hughey, when he was a boy in
              Pennsylvania. He must have been a very active little boy and often
              prone to mischief. </p>
            <p>It was told that he took his little dog to school with him one
              time to protect him from the discipline he might receive. Also,
              for the same reason, he told that one time he wore an extra pair
              of trousers when he feared a thrashing. </p>
            <p>Mother told how she, Hannah Bixby, had to care for her younger
              twin sisters, Myrta and Minnie. Those twins got into mischief
              several times and Hannah had to cope with them and with
              disgruntled relatives. I wish I could remember some of the tales
              she told. </p>
            <p>Thinking of deaths, I well remember some of those events that
              were recalled and quite often retold.</p>
            <p>When Grandfather Daniel Hughey was on his death bed, he
              questioned my mother as to what day of the week it was. As I
              recall, from my mother telling this, she told him it was a certain
              day, say it was Tuesday. Grandfather nodded his head and began to
              count the days of the week on his fingers, "Tuesday, Wednesday,
              Thursday, Friday." He nodded his head as he did so end emphasized
              Friday, then stopped. He died on Friday. Mother in telling about
              this always thought he knew someway the day of his death. </p>
            <p>Father's parents both lived with our family. I was not born
              before Grandfather's death, but I well remember Grandmother
              Hughey's death. I was four years old. Mother held me in her arms
              as we stood by grandmother's bed and watched as her breathing grew
              weaker and finally stopped as the Lord released her. </p>
            <p>Grandfather Judson Amasa Bixby, my mother's father died Feb. 14,
              1912. He knew he was getting progressively weaker. He asked his
              daughters to gather around his bed and he told them plainly the
              way of salvation, as it is in the Bible. He apologized that he had
              not told them plainly before. He softly sang "<a href="https://www.songlyrics.com/the-hymn-makers/just-as-i-am-lyrics/">Just
                As I Am</a>" and it was as he sang and as he gave a clear
              Christian testimony that he slipped away to eternal life. </p>
            <p>Grandmother Bixby became very ill and it was diagnosed that she
              had abdominal cancer. Grandmother had spent many days at a large
              wooden loom, that she had, weaving many yards of rag carpets.</p>
            <p><img src="loom-clip-art.png" alt="Drawing of loom" style="width:18%;">The
              grandsons were so sure that the loom caused Grandma's death that
              after she was gone, they took it down by the lake and broke it
              into as many pieces as they could. They were determined that no
              one else should spend time on that loom. I wished later that they
              had not been so hasty in their judgement. Gramma died on Nov. 28,
              1909. </p>
            <p>She liked to hear me sing, so, as a little girl I sang often to
              her. Since Grandmother died about three years before Grandfather
              Bixby, I remember how he would sit and look at her picture and
              weep, in his loneliness</p>
            <p>These memories are sad, but I am going to recall how they caused
              us to give sober thought to eternal truth and there was a strong
              element of their love and faith in their loving heavenly Father. </p>
            <p>I was teaching in Dickens, North Dakota, when my father died or a
              stroke of paralysis. I received a telegram telling me of his
              impending death, but I could not get home in time to see him
              alive. He died March 29, 1920. My mother died when I was living in
              Sitka, Alaska, on October 28, 1956. </p>
            <p>I hope I may recount truthfully enough of our family annals to
              satisfy my readers.</p>
            <p>It was hard for me to see my husband yield to physical
              disabilities. He was always so staunch when many others had
              succumbed to various hindrances. He had had polio in infancy which
              had left him weakened and lame, but he never gave up. For years he
              ware a brace on his left leg. He wore a built up shoe, so his
              shoes had to be made to order. If our activities entailed walking,
              he never hesitated, but took his part. </p>
            <p>I recall one time he was helping to shingle a roof at Sheldon
              Jackson College. Someone said to me, "Do you agree for him to to
              that sort of thing?" I said, "Why, I could never stop him. He's
              always willing and eager to do a man's share." Not only was he a
              willing helper, but he often took the lead and tackled a job that
              others had failed to accomplish. </p>
            <p><img src="Halibut.svg" alt="Drawing of a halibut" style="width:20%;">Maybe
              the picture I have of George and his boys showing the big halibut
              they caught, may tell a little of his prowess. They put out what
              was called "a skate," a large line or rope in a circle with large
              hooks attached, baited with herring. It was no small job or effort
              to bring a halibut into a boat after they were caught. A halibut
              of any size could well damage a boat. The fish was towed to a
              dock, or shore where the boys could manage it. Anyway, the boys
              and George did manage the big fish, getting to where they could do
              a job of butchering, cutting the fish into manageable pieces. It
              weighed 200 lbs. I know, I had some of it to can. </p>
            <p>I have already mentioned my husband's lameness. It was hard for
              me to see him succumb to physical disabilities. When he had polio
              as a child, his little English mother had done the best she could,
              to massage and exercise him. But the one leg did not develop
              properly and so he was very lame. Nevertheless, he found
              employment and also built up a small saving. </p>
            <p>When the Prescott family had the opportunity to buy a piece of
              property in Sequel, California, it was George who had enough
              savings to be able to make a down payment on the property. It
              became "Prescotts' Inn," a hotel that could accommodate 100
              guests. </p>
            <p>George became very active in the local Congregational Church. He
              longed for more Christian Education and finally he sold his share
              of the Prescott Inn to his brother and sisters and went to Los
              Angeles to attend the Bible Institute of Los Angeles. He graduated
              from the institute in 1926. </p>
            <p>After graduation, he volunteered for the missionary work under
              the Congregational Church and was sent to New Mexico where he
              became boys' worker and shop teacher at Rio Grande Institute near
              Albuquerque. He became so adept as a shop teacher that his prowess
              became fairly well known. </p>
            <p>Manaul School, a Presbyterian Institution in Albuquerque, had
              need of a shop teacher for boys in their curriculum. George was
              recommended and was encouraged to apply for the position. He was
              not qualified as to educational standards since he was not a high
              school graduate. His training had been in a Vocational High
              School. His ability as a mechanic and his natural ability along
              the line of shop work was nevertheless recognized and he was hired
              to become the shop teacher, but his students had to receive their
              credits under another one of the teachers who had the educational
              qualifications, though lacking in mechanical skill. </p>
            <p>George was able to study and pass the necessary qualifications by
              studying under the high school teachers at Menaul. He also began
              to take extension courses at the New Mexico State University.
              Also, he went two summer terms in courses at the Colorado State
              Vocational College in Fort Collins, Colorado. He graduated from
              Colorado State College from his attendance, and received a
              Bachelor's degree from the University of New Mexico. </p>
            <p><img src="oldstylebigroomtruck.svg" alt="Drawing of old car" style="width:15%;">The
              shop department of Manaul school became well known. When auto
              mechanics prevailed, there were friends of the school who brought
              their cars for Menaul School boys to work on, so it became a busy
              auto body shop and the shop students received training that
              excelled. Even welding was added to the curriculum. </p>
            <p>If I don't bring this story to its final end, I will exhaust any
              readers and so I will try to do so. My days here at Exeter House
              in Seattle, Washington are pleasant. I am unusually hale and
              hearty for one in her nineties. My eyes are fairly strong and I
              spend much time in reading. I do not wear a hearing aid as many of
              my companions here at Exeter House do. My memory is good at
              recalling past experiences, but I have to admit that I often
              forget my daily occupations. I am the one who failed to remember
              just why she opened her refrigerator. Was it to take something out
              or was I supposed to put something in? </p>
            <p>I'll date this on August, the ninth, 1992, and say to any patient
              reader, "Adios, Goodbye, until I think of something more that I
              just want to write. </p>

            <li id="Reunion">Herb finally made arrangements to attend the 1923
              Campbell Reunion, but died of a stroke (or heart attack) a few
              months before it. However, his correspondence about attending
              inspired the launching of "<a href="https://www.campbellluggblackwell.com/CCCVolumes.html">The
                Campbell Cousins Correspondence Club</a>." </li>
            <li id="CharleyCongdon">Mary may have been too young to know about
              it, but her family knew Charley a long time. She knew that Herb
              and Charley were first cousins, only a year apart, but she may not
              have known that they knew each other back in Nelson, PA. Or that,
              before Mary was born, Charley lived in Brainerd and taught school
              there. Charley moved from Brainerd to St. Paul where he served as
              music director of the St. Paul Schools for a few years before
              moving on to Chicago and New York. His business travels didn't
              allow him to attend the Campbell Reunions every year, but when he
              couldn't make it, always sent a telegram notifying the secretary
              of his regrets. Mary also met him when he came on business to a
              Minnesota Teachers' Association meeting in St. Paul. He was in <i>Who's
                Who in American Music</i>. </li>
