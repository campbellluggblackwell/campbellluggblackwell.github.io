            <p><img src="Schoolhouse.jpg" alt="Drawing of a country schoolhouse"
                style="width:8%;">My first teacher was Mabel English. Henrietta
              Otterson and I started in the spring of 1905 when we were only
              five. Then that fall we really enrolled as first graders. Mabel
              roomed and boarded at our house as did most of the teachers who
              taught the district #3 school.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
                href="#WW1"></a></p>
            <p>The path to the school house was through our pasture which was
              heavily wooded. It seemed rather scary to me so old Mac would go
              with me till I could see the school house. Then he would accept
              the crust of bread my Mother had given me for him and he would go
              back home alone. </p>
            <p>Old Mac was an unusual dog, very intelligent and obedient. Father
              had about 300 sheep. In the spring or summer, he would (No, I
              believe it was in the fall) take a flock to Brainerd to sell. Old
              Mac would drive the sheep to the outskirts of town. There my
              father would send him home. Mac would trot on back the six miles,
              never stopping along the way. Neighbors used to remark about how
              he minded his business so faithfully. </p>
            <p>In the horse and buggy days, it was the custom to keep a traveler
              overnight. One time we kept a peddler for the night. In the
              morning as he was about to leave he frightened me by suggesting he
              was going to take me with him. I thought he meant it so I ran
              screaming with fright. Mac thought he meant it, too, and came to
              my rescue, grabbing the man's hand in his mouth. I recall the
              peddler remarked to my Father that old Mac was a smart dog.</p>
            <p>A friend of our family, Mr. <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Poorman-315">John
                Poorman</a>, had given me a pug dog. He was worthless, as dogs
              go, but he was my special pet. Mac tolerated him, even defended
              him when the big old dog of Thompson's attacked him.</p>
            <p><img src="Goose.png" alt="Drawing of a goose" style="width:8%;">One
              time when Dad was butchering, Bingo, the pug, thought he'd snitch
              a bit of meat. Old Mac set him straight as to dog manners by
              growling at him and preventing the theft. Bingo went slinking to
              the house and crept under the porch or "meditate" on his lesson.
              Bingo later forgot and committed an unforgivable error. He robbed
              a goose nest of thirteen eggs and that finished him as far as
              continuing to live with us. I wept, but Bingo was banished and
              taken away. Mac lived to be fourteen years old. </p>
            <p>Other teachers I had in the country school were Ethel Chase,
              Irene Orton, Jennie Nelson, Elsie English, Edith Warnberg and
              Maude Caughey, in the order named. Ethel Chase, my second grade
              teacher, opened school each morning with prayer. I loved her for
              that. Irene Overton took time to play with me and was a good
              friend to all the family. She taught my mother to do burnt work
              and we all had a chance to help create some pretty objects. Elsie
              English taught me to play the organ and also started me giving
              "readings," which became my specialty. She also brought out some
              of my worst rebellious actions, for I resented her scoldings. She
              didn't build a love of music by making me cry when giving me a
              lesson. Edith was my seventh grade teacher and for a while our
              family was certain that my brother, Edd would eventually marry
              her, for he was her steady beau. Maude Caughey was my eighth grade
              teacher and I really settled down under her training and so I
              graduated from District #3 School. </p>
