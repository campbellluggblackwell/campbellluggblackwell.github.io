        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Perhaps the Campbell Clan inspired the decimal system. Anyway, <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> seems to think one hundred pages
        would look better than ninety-nine; and since <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I773">
        Llewellyn Shaw</a> has "lumbago in his wrist", Will has drafted me as a
        "pinch hitter."
      </p>
      <p>
        First, let me say that at the election yesterday Hindenburg wasn't
        chosen president, but <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1505">
        Roswell Young</a> was, and "Yours Truly" steps back to private life.
        The vote wasn't as large as might have been wished, but it was the view
        of the electorate that honors should be passed around. So I now wish to
        again express appreciation of the honor of being an officer, and extend
        best wishes to Roswell and to the other officers elected. <a href=
        "BosardFlorence1887.html">Florence Bosard</a> made a whirlwind campaign
        for Vice President, while <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1050">
        Mary Snavely</a>'s simon pure efficiency knocked into a "cocked hat"
        the ambition of all other aspirants to the custodianship of funds. As
        to secretary, that always is a "dog's job", and since poor Will, when
        it comes to working for the clan, has so well earned the title of "OLD
        DOG TRAY", the secretarial function was thrust upon him over his
        protest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Will has originated the slogan "ONE HUNDRED LETTERS FOR 1926". Better
        help him convert this slogan into a reality. The formula is as simple
        as a "dollar down and a dollar a week." All that is necessary is to
        write a 1926 letter when he asks for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an <a href="CCCV3Insert.html">insert</a> the cost of the present
        book is mentioned. The duplication of books in the same household
        seems, no doubt, an unwarranted expense. Here is the real problem of
        finance in a nutshell. The first copy of an edition costs more than the
        entire balance of the edition put together. It really makes but little
        difference in the aggregate expense whether fifty books or seventy-five
        are made up. The problem of cost, therefore, is to distribute as
        equitably as possible the cost of providing a reasonable edition rather
        than to regard each copy delivered as we would regard a bushel of
        potatoes ---just so much by measurement. Where deliveries within a
        household or within a family are too much doubled up, it would seem
        entirely reasonable to take the above into consideration and let the
        combined family or household remittance be what it is felt the books
        represent to the combined household or family. The price per copy
        mentioned in the insert when multiplied by the number of copies
        manufactured represents the actual outlay. So with the above suggestion
        should be coupled the suggestion that to make up for the "discounts"
        proposed above, some whose families are small or some who just feel so
        inclined might remit in excess of the rate proposed. Why not try this
        plan for the present year and let us see if this somewhat Eutopian
        scheme will not just about supply the answer to the question of
        finances, and do it in a way that will satisfy everyone and give to no
        one the slightest sense of embarrassment.
