                  would be in a plan of this kind to keep all of the
                  Cousins in touch with one another. His heart was ever
                  back at the old home and he would have visited you all
                  long ago had not his home and work seemed to demand
                  his present attention. He had fully determined to make
                  the long&#8209;desired trip "back East" this summer and we
                  were all planning with him toward that end, but you
                  all know that he has made the longer trip to the
                  heavenly home. <br>

                  of every enterprise that pointed toward progress. He
                  deeded the piece of land on which our schoolhouse was
                  built in 1888. He was clerk of the school district
                  from the time of its organization until the time when
                  he left for California in 1907. He served as Town
                  Clerk for twelve years. He never did anything
                  spectacular but he was respected and loved by his
                  neighbors. They depended on him for he was able to
                  serve them. He was one of those leaders that are so
                  much needed in rural communities. He has left his
                  children no wealth of land or goods but a richer
                  inheritance in a name unstained by act of meanness.
                  The memory of his ability to make friends and keep
                  them, his courage, his readiness to do more than his
                  share, comes to them with a sweetness which is of
                  untold value. <br>

                    Milton Hughey<!-- {/a} --> is thirty, at present a
                    bachelor. He is the one who has taken up the burdens
                    of the home. He is deeply concerned over the
                    spiritual welfare of men, believing that "He who
                    saves souls is wise". Only last week he worked with
                    a young minister evangelist in a series of revival
                    meetings, where at least twelve converts found their
                    Saviour. These revival meetings were held in the
                    little country school&#8209;house where Harry has been
                    preaching on Sundays for the past year. <br>
