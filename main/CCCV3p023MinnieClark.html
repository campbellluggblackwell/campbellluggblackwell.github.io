      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> We are again called upon to exchange letters. I hope that this year we
        shall receive one from each of the cousins. Some of them have gone from
        our midst by reason of death. We can't get over <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1448">Ross</a>'s
        death. He was such a useful man. He is very much missed by the company.</p>
      <p><a href="SeelyAda1858.html">Cousin Ada</a> had a bad loss by fire. She
        is now living in the Seely house next door to me. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I456">Mrs.
          Seely</a> died very suddenly, after being sick only one hour.</p>
      <p>Today we are having March winds, all right, and snow and rain. Well, I
        guess we shall have spring sometime.</p>
      <p><a href="TubbsAnn1855.html">Anne</a> was just in and reminded me about
        my letter, saying that it should reach New York by the first of April. I
        am so glad to receive the letters. I can't wait to get and read them
        all. They come from so many different states and cities.</p>
      <p>Well, I cannot think of very much to write. I stay at home most of the
        time during the winter, but I have been to Nelson once this winter. <a
          href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1608">Alta
          Cady</a> comes in quite often.<sup>1</sup> I have not been up on the
        farm since New Year's Day.</p>
      <p>I see in the Nelson items that <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Ann
          Owlett</a> is home. I was glad she visited New York <span class="Annotation">[City]</span>.
        I heard part of President Coolidge's fine inaugural address over the
        radio<sup>2</sup>.</p>
      <p><a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1470">Will</a>
        still works at carpenter work<sup>3</sup> and likes it very much.</p>
      <p>Well, I guess that I have written enough for this time.</p>
      <p>Love to all the cousins,</p>

      <p>1. Alta's wife, Jennie Selph, was adopted by Minnie's parents.</p>
      <p>2. Radio was starting to become a significant part of people's lives.</p>
      <p>3. Will often worked with Lee Smith Tubbs, brother-in-law of Cousin
        Frances (Goodrich) Hoyt, and grandfather of Cousin Ande Tubbs' husband.</p>
