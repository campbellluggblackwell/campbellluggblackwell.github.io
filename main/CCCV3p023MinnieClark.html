        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        We are again called upon to exchange letters. I hope that this year we
        shall receive one from each of the cousins. Some of them have gone from
        our midst by reason of death. We can't get over <span wc_id="I1448">
        Ross</span>'s death. He was such a useful man. He is very much missed by
        the company.
      </p>
<p>
<a href="SeelyAda1858.html">Cousin Ada</a> had a bad loss by fire. She
        is now living in the Seely house next door to me. <span wc_id="I456">
        Mrs. Seely</span> died very suddenly, after being sick only one hour.
      </p>
<p>
        Today we are having March winds, all right, and snow and rain. Well, I
        guess we shall have spring sometime.
      </p>
<p>
<a href="TubbsAnn1855.html">Anne</a> was just in and reminded me about
        my letter, saying that it should reach New York by the first of April.
        I am so glad to receive the letters. I can't wait to get and read them
        all. They come from so many different states and cities.
      </p>
<p>
        Well, I cannot think of very much to write. I stay at home most of the
        time during the winter, but I have been to Nelson once this winter.
        <span wc_id="I1608">
        Alta Cady</span> comes in quite often.<sup>1</sup> I have not been up on
        the farm since New Year's Day.
      </p>
<p>
        I see in the Nelson items that <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Ann
        Owlett</a> is home. I was glad she visited New York <span class="Annotation">[City]</span>. I heard part of President Coolidge's fine
        inaugural address over the radio<sup>2</sup>.
      </p>
<p>
<span wc_id="I1470">
        Will</span> still works at carpenter work<sup>3</sup> and likes it very
        much.
      </p>
<p>
        Well, I guess that I have written enough for this time.
      </p>
<p>
        Love to all the cousins,
      </p>
