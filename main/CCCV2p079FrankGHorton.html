    <div class="Salutation">
      <p>My dear Cousins: </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>The last volume of Cousin letters is certainly an inspiration to wish
        to be in the next one.</p>
      <p>It is truly wonderful to find how the seed has scattered and taken root
        in so many distant corners and yet through the happy thought of <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin
          Will</a>, the links are connected and the chain is complete.</p>
      <p> We as you all know are out "Where the West begins" and while we think
        we live in a wonderful part of the country, with ideal climate, all of
        the beauties of nature, and a spirit born in the West, there is still
        something lacking to complete the ideal, for while one makes friends and
        has many pleasant acquaintances, there is no one so near and dear as our
        "ain haim<sup>1</sup> folk."</p>
      <p>Portland is known as the Rose City for we have over two hundred miles
        of rose-lined streets which bloom nine months of the year; the climate
        is never severe although we have a rainy season from November to March.
        This has been a very dry winter all over the Pacific Coast States,
        consequently a very pleasant one, and a very early spring; all fruits
        are in blossom and the markets are full of green stuff; my garden looks
        fine and we have been eating rhubarb for some time.</p>
      <p> I am looking forward to the time when we can attend one of the
        Campbell Re-unions and while St. Petersburg is a long way from Portland,
        <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Uncle Tommie</a> and <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">Aunt
          Frank</a> are not safe in making a bid for the next convention unless
        they expect to charge regular rates.</p>
      <p>with greetings from Oregon and love to all, </p>
