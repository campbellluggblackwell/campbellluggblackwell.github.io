      <h3>Our Website</h3>
      <p class="FirstP">Our family history website has more than 500 pages of
        old letters, photos, news clips, family records, etc. But sometimes it
        can seem "an embarrassment of riches." How can you find the items you'd
        like to see? Especially when you don't know what's there?</p>
      <p>There is a menu on the left side. And some of the items listed are
        tables of contents to sections of it. But unlike a book, it doesn't have
        an overall table of contents.</p>
      <h3>"Googling"</h3>
      <p class="FirstP">Like most websites, this one is indexed by the major
        search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc. So you can search for
        its pages the way you search any website. But those tools search
        millions of web sites, and list hits from the most popular websites
        first, so you may see results from countless other web sites at the top
        of your list of "hits." Moreover they apparently only index it once a
        month, so there is a lag between when we add or modify a web page and
        when they will "discover" the change.</p>
      <p>Even worse, they can only search the words that appear on the web
        pages. For example a letter may sometimes refer to say, Elisha Shore
        Horton, as <i>father</i>, <i>Lish</i> or <i>E. S. Horton</i>. The
        word matching algorithms of the major search engines can easily miss the
        document you are looking for. And, if you search for <i>father</i>
        you'd be inundated by millions of hits.</p>
      <h3>Our Site Specific Search Engine</h3>
      <p class="FirstP">Fortunately there's an alternative, a tool that searches
        only this site. Searching a single site is much faster than searching
        the entire web. The search engine we're using, <i>FreeFind</i>, indexes
        our site at least weekly, rather than only monthly. Even more important,
        it can search not only on words that occur in the document, but on index
        terms <i>(keywords)</i> that have been added by volunteers. (That's one
        of the areas we're looking for help with.)</p>
      <p><i>[In this page 1 of a "users manual", guidebook, tutorial or whatever
          you want to call it, I will try to present the basics of searching our
          website. Page 2 will cover "the bells and whistles" and page 3 will be
          case studies of actual searches by users.]</i></p>
      <p><img src="SearchBox.jpg" alt="image of search box" style="float: left; width: 172px; height: 180px; margin-right:50">
        The search window is located at the upper left of our website's home
        page.&nbsp; Looking at it you will see a link, <i>search tips</i>,
        followed by another link, <i>advanced search</i>. Below them is the
        search box, followed by a button labeled <i>search</i>. First we'll
        discuss the mechanics of how they work (which most of you can figure out
        from clicking on the <a href="https://www.freefind.com/searchtipspop.html">search
          tips</a> button, most of which is discussed below) -- followed by
        search strategies well suited to this site. <span class="Annotation">(If
          you feel like you have plenty of experience doing searches you may
          want to skip ahead to the "Smart Searching" section.)</span></p>
      <p><b>FUNDAMENTALS</b>. You can type one or more words (or even just
        strings of characters)and click on the button. If you type <i>cat</i>
        and click, it will give you a list of all the web pages on this site
        that contain the word 'cat'. If you type in <i>cat dog pig</i>, it will
        give you a list of all the web pages that contain the word 'cat', or the
        word 'dog', or the word 'pig'. </p>
      <p>Suppose we want to see just those pages that only contain the phrase <i>Elisha
          Horton</i>, not just all that contain 'Elisha' and all containing
        'Horton'. To do that enter <i>"Elisha Horton"</i>, enclosed in quotes,
        into the search box.</p>
      <div style="clear: both;"> </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Knowing the Territory</h3>
        <p class="FirstP">A character in the play <i>Music Man</i> proclaimed
          "Ya gotta know the territory." Obviously knowing what's on the site
          isn't a prerequisite for searching the site. But familiarity with the
          way the writers of the documents expressed themselves helps. For
          example, if you read a lot of the documents on this site you'll see
          that men often <b>used initials</b> instead of first and middle
          names. "T. C. Campbell", "M. B. Seely", "J. Edward Hazlett", etc. So,
          a search for "Thomas Campbell" or "Mark Seely" or "James Hazlett" will
          miss those documents. </p>
        <p><b>Name Flipping/omitting:</b> You also have a better chance of
          finding the document you want if you realize that in those days it was
          common for someone to "flip" their first and last names -- "Phoebe
          Jessica Hoyt" became "Jessica Phoebe Hoyt"; "Thomas Edgar Congdon"
          became "Edgar Thomas Congdon", etc. Searchers need to be flexible and
          search multiple ways. Or, especially with women, sometimes drop their
          first name entirely.</p>
        <p><b>Spelling Variations:</b> Spelling rules weren't rigid. Phebe
          (Campbell) Hoyt always spelled her given name without the 'o'. If you
          only search for <i>Phoebe</i> you'll miss a lot of web pages <span class="Annotation">
            [unless indexing volunteers come to your rescue]</span>. Many names
          have variant spellings: Green/Greene, Seely/Seeley,
          Mourie/Mourey/Mowrey, Haslet/Hazelett/Hazels/Hazlett. Even
          Johnson/Yonson.</p>
        <p>But those problems almost disappear for our web pages that have been
          indexed by a <a href="https:sties.rootsweb.com/capane/volunteer.html">volunteer</a>.
          Our site's search engine, <i>FreeFind</i>, can recognize index terms
          that have been added to a document. When it's not clear who a document
          is referring to, we've added links that make it clear to human readers
          who is being talked about. But the contents of the links isn't
          accessible by search engines -- they only "see" words that occur in
          the document. If a document mentions "Lish", a volunteer indexing the
          webpage can add "Elisha Horton" as a <b>keyword</b>. <span class="Annotation">[The
            indexer knows his name because they can click on the link.]</span>
          If the document mentions "Aunt Jane", thanks to the link, the indexer
          can add "Jane Campbell Tubbs" and "Jane Tubbs" as keywords. The trick
          is to think "if someone wants to find this document, what words need
          to be added in order for <i>FreeFind</i> to find it. Volunteer
          indexers ask themselves, "What search terms would someone looking for
          this document use?" Many of our webpages have been indexed, but most
          have not. Volunteers who index our web pages greatly improve the
          chances of a searcher's success.</p>
        <h3>Common Errors &amp; Smart Searching</h3>
        <p class="FirstP">Our webmaster gets reports from <i>FreeFind</i> about
          the searches that are made. Not who was searching, but the search
          terms used and a link to the "hits" found by each search. So we gain
          some insights into what search strategies work and which ones don't
          work. Of course we can't read the searcher's mind and know for sure
          what he/she had in mind. But we can see, and infer, a lot.</p>
        <p><b>SEARCHING for LIVING PEOPLE.</b> Except in a few cases, such as
          minutes or programs of recent Campbell Reunions, living people aren't
          mentioned on these web pages. <span class="Annotation">[Our Facebook
            pages or YouTube pages provide better hunting for them.]</span> </p>
        <p><b>OR, AND, Phrases.</b> OR is the default. For instance, entering <b><i>robert
              lugg</i></b> in the search box will search our site for all pages
          that contain the word 'Robert' <u>or</u> the word 'Lugg'. Which is
          fine if that's what you intended -- but "OR" searches can produce a
          VERY long hit list. If you wanted all the web pages that contained the
          word 'Robert' and also the word 'Lugg' you could use the plus sign.
          E.g. by typing <b><i>+robert +lugg</i></b> in the search box.</p>
        <p><b>Phrases</b> are the technique to use if word order matters. If
          you're looking for occurrences the word 'robert' immediately followed
          by the word 'lugg', then type <b><i>"robert lugg"</i></b> in the
          search box. But those searches look for exact matches -- they wouldn't
          find occurrences of 'Robert P. Lugg' or of 'Robert S. Lugg'. Typing <b><i>"robert
              p. lugg"</i></b> into the search block would find the former and <b><i>"robert
              s. lugg"</i></b> would find the second. Or, we could find both in
          one search by using the wildcard symbol <b><i>?</i></b>&nbsp; to
          stand for any character. Entering <b><i>"robert ?. lugg"</i></b> into
          the search box would find both the 'p' version and the 's' version in
          one search. </p>
        <p><b>Ending a search word with a wild card.</b> <i>FreeFind</i> by
          default finds variations of an English language "word root." If you
          search for 'climb' it will retrieve 'climbs', 'climbed' and
          'climbing'. And if you search for 'Green' it will retrieve 'Greene' as
          well. The <b>?</b> wildcard only works for a single character in
          fixed position in a word -- being the nth character. So, if you want
          to search for both 'Seely' and 'Seeley' it's no help. But there's a
          different wild card symbol you use at the end of a word that can match
          any number of characters. Entering <b><i>seel*</i></b> into the
          search box will find both 'Seely' and 'Seeley'.</p>
        <h3>Practice Makes Perfect</h3>
        <p class="FirstP">That's a lot to absorb in one setting. But the more
          searches you do, the better you'll become at it.</p>
