    <div class="Salutation">
      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> April first has again arrived, but here in Pennsylvania it still seems
        like winter. However, we have been very comfortable as we returned to
        primitive ways and have burned wood because the gas did not give the
        satisfaction it formerly did. </p>
      <p> I hope you all have been well the past year. I don't think I have seen
        any cousins since October, except the ones in Nelson and Osceola. By the
        way, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1608">Alta</a>
        and I were the only ones who attended both of the Cousins Dinners last
        year<sup>1</sup>. We enjoyed both. We also enjoyed our short visit with
        the relatives in New Jersey<sup>2</sup>. We visited some of the
        interesting points in New York <span class="Annotation">[City]</span>.
      </p>
      <p> Of the things we saw in New York, the thing that stands our most
        prominently in my mind is the representation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ten_Commandments_%281923_film%29">Ten
          Commandments</a> produced by Cecil. B. DeMille. Perhaps you have all
        seen this, but if you have not and have an opportunity to see it, don't
        miss it. You will find it well worth while. Our drive through the
        Delaware Water Gap was another outstanding experience.</p>
      <p>I like entertainment. (There is nothing here but the Aid Society). I
        usually try to attend the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chautauqua">Chautauqua</a>
        which is held each year in some of the nearby towns. I think I
        appreciated most an English lady who pictured the difference between
        England and America. Her subject was "You Americans". She came here with
        "our boys" after the World War. She had been a war nurse. She said she
        could never forget the cheering as they came in sight of American
        shores, and she wondered what it would be when they saw the Statue of
        Liberty. But said she, "Then they were silent".</p>
      <p>The lecturer spoke of our train service and, in fact nearly everything
        as being in advance of England. They have no porches there - no rocking
        chairs. The first barbershop she saw here she thought was a hospital
        with the operating room in front. She never heard of "hot dogs" until
        she came here. Once some friends from here sent her people a watermelon
        and they boiled it. The English like seclusion. They draw down the
        shades at night and live behind their hedges. Only the rich and
        businessmen have cars and telephones, and still we all worship the same
        God!</p>

      <p>1. Almost always, the "Cousins Dinners", which were for the
        grandchildren of Ann CLINCH Campbell, were held in the vicinity of
        Nelson. One early exception was one held at Sugar Hill, in Schuyler Co.,
        NY. But in the fall of 1924 the most distant site ever selected, Charlie
        Congdon's summer home near Stroudsburg, PA. Some of the Cousins were
        unable or unwilling travel that far, so Laura BOSARD Mourey/Mowrey held
        one in Farmington Twp.</p>
      <p>2. The NJ relatives most likely wisited were Will Selph,Geo. L. Buck
        and/or his sister, Myra BUCK Seiders.</p>
