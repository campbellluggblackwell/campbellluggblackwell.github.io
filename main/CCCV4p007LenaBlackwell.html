      <p>Dear Cousins All:-</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> Last Spring when Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a>
        sent us the C.C.C. Book, we were more than pleased; we simply devoured
        every word of it, and our boys <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2376">Enoch</a>
        and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2427">Preston</a>
        enjoyed it as much as we.</p>
      <p>For the sake of the Cousins who do not know just how we are Cousins, I
        will explain: <a href="BlackwellEnoch1814.html">Father Blackwell</a>'s
        own <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">sister</a> was Mother of the <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James
          Campbell</a>l Family and his <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">half sister</a>
        was Mother of the <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph Campbell</a>
        Family.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We have had a long, cold and snowy winter, the first snow coming as
        early as October. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2369">Charles</a>
        and I have wished many times that we were in the Sunny South, enjoying
        the sunshine and flowers with the <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a>
        and <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">Frank</a>, and the several other
        Cousins and friends who are spending the winter there. However, we are
        anxiously awaiting the warm Springtime.</p>
      <p> Charlie, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I6065">Ruth</a>
        and I have been alone this winter. Ruth is so much company, also a lot
        of help to us.</p>
      <p>Preston, our youngest son and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2428">wife</a>,
        have just purchased <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I718">my
          Father</a>'s home in Nelson, and are all moved there. We are delighted
        to have them so near. I can go <u>home</u> now whenever I feel
        inclined.</p>
      <p>Enoch, our eldest son and family are living at Lawrenceville, Pa. They
        have lovely children whom I am proud to have call me Grandmother. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2380">Enoch
          Dellivan</a>, the boy, was four the 15th of January, 1926, and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2421">Caroline
          Mae</a> will be one year old the 16th of March, 1926, She is dear, and
        as some of the Cousins already know, is the first girl to be born in our
        family. The last time I went to Lawrenceville to see them Enoch and
        little Dellivan met me at the Railroad Station and Dellivan said,
        "Grandmother, I'm gong home with you and stay 'till we die." Enoch is
        doing very nicely and is planning to build a new home at Lawrenceville
        this summer.</p>
      <p>We were so shocked over the tragic death of our friend and Cousin <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil
          Young</a>. Our hearts go out in sympathy to his bereaved family. We
        are thinking of the pleasant hours spent in the home of our dear Cousins
        <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1493">Lou</a>
        and Phil.</p>
      <p>We are anticipating a great treat in reading letters from a hundred
        Cousins this year, and I trust that not one of them will fail to
        respond. Let's all do all we can to help Cousin Will carry on this great
        work. As this is my very first appearance think I have said enough.</p>
