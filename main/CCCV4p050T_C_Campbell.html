        Dear Cousins:-

</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        Greetings to every one of you! It is most gratifying to me to note that
        our worthy officers are interesting the younger set of our Clan in
        contributions to our annual book of letters. One cannot estimate the
        value "Their Children" will put on these volumes now in the making,
        even fifty years from now. If I could get such a set of works, covering
        the various incidents of the lives of my ancestors, written fifty years
        ago, it would be priceless. And of necessity these younger ones must,
        and are becoming the live wires to carry this work along. Each year we
        are getting two or three less letters from the "First
        Cousins"<sup>2</sup> than we did the year before.<sup>3</sup>
</p>
<p>
        As the <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie Campbell</a>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">twig</span> of the <a href="CampbellWilliam1822.html">William Campbell</a> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">branch</span> of the <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph Campbell</a> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tree</span> has been exploited to the
        fullest in the past three volumes there seems but little I can add to
        the genealogy in this letter. I might add that on the 12th day of this
        month, <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">Frank</a> and I will celebrate
        the 50th anniversary of our wedding, and both feel young at heart, and
        physically spry joining, in all the activities a real tourist City has
        to offer.
      </p>
<p>
        I am still engaged in buying and selling real-estate, and am at the
        Office every day directing all activities in connection with my
        affairs, with as much vigor as when at Knoxville doing business for the
        old New York Central Railway Company.<sup>4</sup> I wish you might all
        be with us here on this "Golden Wedding Day"<sup>5</sup> but if this is
        impossible, just make your plans to be with us on our "Diamond" wedding
        day. The salt air is a great preservative you know. We invite you all
        to come down and try it.
      </p>
<p>
        Wishing each of you long life, happiness and prosperity,
      </p>

<div class="Footnote">
<p>
        1. To many of the descendants of the writers of these CCC letters, they
        are indeed "pricelsss," which is why I'm putting them on the web -- so
        that all present and future descendants could have these glimpses of
        their roots. Some have no interest at all in their family history, but
        their grandchildren may discover, and someday cherish, thses letters
        -wbt.
      </p>
<p>
        2. By "First Cousins," Tommie was referring to himself, and the 30
        other grandchildren of <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph</a>
        &amp;  <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann Clinch</a> Campbell. All
        were born in the Nelson area, and those who survived infancy grew up
        there. All "knew" each other, except that some of the older ones left
        the area before the younger ones formed memories of them.
      </p>
<p>
        3. Tommie's First Cousins were aging and rapidly dying off.
      </p>
<p>
        4. He had been their station agent at Knoxville, PA.
