    <h1>Reminiscences of <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Jane
        CAMPBELL Tubbs</a> (1834 - 1917)</h1>
    <div>
      <p>In an early time, perhaps 1840. I can remember when my <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">father</a>
        drove wolves away from the sheepfold with a pole. Soon after this a
        panther followed my&nbsp;<a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">mother</a> along
        the butter-milk run-road screaming a [sic] intervals, scareing [sic] her
        nearly to death.</p>
      <p>Later my brother <a href="CampbellWilliam1822.html">Wm.</a> killed a
        large snake on fathers farm measuring 12 feet &amp; having 4 legs. I can
        also remember when we had to go to the neighbors for fire brands &amp;
        carry it between two barks. matches not being so plentiful as they are
        now. Our cooking was all done over the fire place. using iron bake
        kettle &amp; tin oven.</p>
      <p>I was the last one born on the old log house on the flat.</p>
      <p>I can still remember when Sister<a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html"> Phebe</a>
        fell down the cellar-stairs &amp; broke her jaw. but she can talk as
        good as ever.</p>
      <p>We used to watch the bars to keep the cattle from going from one field
        to another when father was having [haying?] or any teaming instead of
        closing them each time.</p>
      <p><a href="HarperMary1749.html">Grandmother Campbell</a> used to wade the
        river bare-footed with the children. She was 97 when she died.</p>
      <p>Mrs. George Tubbs</p>
