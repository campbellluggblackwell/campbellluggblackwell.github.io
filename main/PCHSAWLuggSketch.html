          W. Lugg</a>, who died quite suddenly at <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoxville,_Pennsylvania">Knoxville</a>
        on the 20th ultimo, was a leading business man in the Cowanesque
        Valley for many years. He had been as well as usual, and on the
        morning of his death he arose and attended to the fires in the
        home. Soon after this he complained of a pain in the region of
        his heart and lay down upon a couch and died in about 15
        minutes.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The funeral was held at Knoxville last week
        Monday, and the remains were taken to Nelson for internment.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Lugg some time before his death prepared
        a sketch of his life and requested its publication after his
        death. It being concise and interesting, we copy it from the
        Knoxville Courier.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, Anthony W. Lugg, was born in the town of
        Bisley, Gloucestershire, England, August 31, 1825, and
        immigrated with my parents in 1830. We arrived in New York city
        in July, from whence we journeyed to <a
          href="BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's Island</a>, now known as
        Nelson. At the time, my parents settled on a farm then owned by
        <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James Campbell</a>, now owned
        by Philo Stevens. In May, 1831, my parents returned to
        Gloucestershire, England, with a family of five children, where
        they remained for two years, and in May, 1833, returned to the
        United States. Sailing from Liverpool and arriving in New York
        in the month of July, we continued our journey to Painted Post,
        N. Y. My father, <a href="LuggCharles1791.html">Charles Lugg</a>,
        bought a farm of Arthur H. Erwin on the west side of the
        Conhocton [sic] river, and lived there about two months and sold
        out and moved again to Beecher's Island. My father then bought a
        farm about one mile south of Nelson. Here my father cleared a
        farm of two hundred acres. I remained on the farm with my father
        until twenty-five years of age, when I married to <a

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After my marriage, I moved to a small farm
        which I got of my father, and which was west of my father's
        land. Here I remained about five years, when my health failed. I
        then went into partnership with Morgan Seely and James Bebe, and
        we began mercantile business at Nelson in 1855. In two years Mr.
        Seely and myself purchased the interest of James Bebe, and I
        remained in partnership with Morgan Seely for about twenty five
        years.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the fall of 1877 I went to California for
        my health and returned in the spring of 1878 and enjoyed fair
        health for about four years, when my health failed and I went to
        California the second time, and remained there till spring
        returning with my health much improved. Upon my return I
        occupied the farm formerly owned by my father and where he lived
        for over forty years. After remaining upon the old homestead for
        about four years, I purchased a store of E. B. Phillips, at
        Knoxville, and went into the mercantile business in March 1886,
        with my son, <a

          Waldo Lugg</a>, having attained his majority, was made a
        member of the firm, and thus it has continued." <br>
