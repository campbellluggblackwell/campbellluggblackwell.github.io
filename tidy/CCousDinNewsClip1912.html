        <span style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 105%;">NELSON, Pa.,</span>
        Sept. 25 ---On Saturday, Sept 21, the annual Cousins Dinner, of the
        descendants of <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph</a> and
        <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann Campbell</a>, of Nelson, met at "The
        Maples" on Sugar Hill,<sup>1</sup> the home of of Mr. and <a href=
        "CongdonEmma1848.html">Mrs. J. L. Buck</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At about 11 o'clock the guests began to arrive, first an auto from
        Nelson, then another from Harrison Valley; then the <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watkins_Glen,_New_York">Watkins</a>
        'bus, with Elmira cousins and also Mr. and Mrs. <a href=
        "CongdonCharles1856.html">C. H. Congdon</a>, of Chicago; then the teams
        from <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_Dams,_New_York">Beaver Dams</a>
        with Cousins from the <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowanesque_River">Cowansesque
        Valley</a><sup>2</sup>. They were greeted by Mr. and Mrs. Buck and Mr.
        and Mrs. <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">E. T. Congdon</a> of Tacoma,
        Wash. The day was beautiful. A bountiful chicken dinner was served,
        after which toasts and remembrances occupied much of the afternoon.
        Each one was asked to relate his earliest remembrances of The Old
        Homestead." Some amusing experiences and some sad ones were told.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later all adjourned to the spacious porch an sang campaign songs, led
        by C. H. Congdon who has written and compiled the song book,
        "Progressive Battle Hymns" used by the Progressive Party.<sup>3</sup>
        As there were members of all three parties present the situation was
        very amusing, but the music was all that could be desired. A letter was
        read from <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">W. E. Selph</a>, and
        greetings were received from Misses <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I962">
        Bernice</a> and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I966">
        Louise Congdon</a> of Chicago. A buffet lunch was served in the
        evening, after which a business meeting was held. The next dinner will
        be held at the home of <a href="SeelyAda1858.html">Mrs. Ada
        Crandall</a> at Osceola.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eighteen of the party remained at"The Maples," and the remainder at
        Monterey<sup>4</sup> and Townsend<sup>5</sup>. Sunday morning all
        returned to "The Maples" and another dinner was served. This time lake
        trout was prepared.
      </p>
      <p>
        A pleasant feature was that every one of <a href=
        "ClinchAnn1804.html">Grandmother Campbell</a>'s 11<sup>6</sup> children
        were represented with the exception of <a href=
        "CampbellElizabeth1830.html">Mrs. Elizabeth Hughey</a>, who had one
        son, <a href="HugheyHerbert1857.html">H. C. Hughey</a>, now living near
        Brainerd, Minn. The recent death <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>
        of some of the family caused a vein of sadness to permeate the
        otherwise happy gathering. At about 2 o'clock Sunday afternoon they
        began to disperse, all voting this to be the banner meeting and Mr. and
        Mrs. Buck royal entertainers.

        Corning for a train to Beaver Dams, and then come by wagon from a
        livery stable.
