          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">father</a> sent me some Campbell Cousins Correspondence paper with the invitation to join this Correspondence Circle, it made me feel like a true member of the Campbell Clan.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the last report a most enjoyable summer has been passed. For two weeks in July we visited the Cousins in Tioga County. At this time I met many of our relatives whose names I had only heard before and also met again some whom I could not remember.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In September I motored up here and since then I have been enjoying to the fullest extent the greatest opportunity life has opened up for me. College life with all its various phases is certainly wonderful.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Norton is located between Providence and Boston, in a very beautiful part of the country, as our Massachusetts Cousins know. It is especially lovely just now with all the leaves turning, and we take many enjoyable walks through the woods.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one of the smaller Colleges, having an enrollment of about four hundred students. The majority of our buildings are red brick and I have the good fortune to have my room in the newest dormitory. The Library is the very newest building, built with Doric columns and the words ‚ÄùThat ye may have life and have it abundantly", the Wheaton motto, across the facade.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have just celebrated Founders' Day which was very impressive. At this time many alumnae return and after exercises in the Chapel, they are entertained at receptions and a hockey game is played with them. This year we had the good luck to defeat them in this sport.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we are looking forward to the annual circus and the Hallowe'en initiation for Freshmen.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings my very best wishes to all the Cousins.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very sincerely,<br>
          <br>
