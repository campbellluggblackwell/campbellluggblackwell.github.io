Hughey</a>, a cousin of Henry and Andrew Hughey of Sugar Hill, Frank Waugh of County Line, Emmett Love and Mrs. <a href="CongdonEmma1848.html">Emma</a> (Jabe) Buck of Watkins, died March 29th last at his farm home near Brainerd, at the age of 65. Mr. Hughey was related to Mrs. Buck on his mother's side and has many relatives in Tioga and Potter counties, Pennsylvania<br>
      <br></font> <font face="Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Herbert C. Hughey was a son of Daniel and <a href="CampbellElizabeth1830.html">Elizabeth Campbell</a> Hughey. Daniel was a brother of Robert, a well-known citizen of Schuyler County, long since deceased, and of Joseph Hughey now of Sugar Hill. The family has been prominent in this county for nearly a century. The parents and elder children emigrated from Ireland as early as 1814.<br>
      <br></font> <font face="Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Herbert was born on Sugar Hill in 1857. His parents moved to Nelson, Tioga county, Pa., in the middle sixties. Herbert went to Brainerd, Minn., in 1879 and his parents followed a year or two later. At Brainerd he worked in the Northern Pacific shops as a carpenter and later acquired a valuable farm in Long Lake township seven miles from Brainerd.<br>
      <br></font> <font face="Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Hughey spent a year in San Francisco, shortly after the great fire, engaged in the work of rebuilding that stricken city. He left the farm that year in the hands of his family which consisted of a most estimable <a href="BixbyHannah1863.html">wife</a> and four children, now all grown up and very capable. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1204">Carrie</a>, (Mrs. W. L. Taylor), lives at Deerwood, Minn.; <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1222">J. Edgar</a>, is a prosperous farmer of Roy, Montana; <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1234">Harry</a> runs the home farm and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1244">Mary</a> teaches at Dickinson, N. D.<br>
      <br></font> <font face="Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Hughey was a member of the Presbyterian church. At one time Harry was seriously considering entering the ministry but thus far home duties have prevented. The traditions of his forefathers have been well followed in the family or Herbert C. Hughey.</font><br>
