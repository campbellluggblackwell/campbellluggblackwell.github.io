        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I surely will make an effort to write this morning; have been notified that letters are now due. I have been sick for two weeks and my <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1414">Grand Boy</a> who stays with me and goes to school at Elkland has also been sick so it was impossible to write sooner.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have had a good many below zero mornings here in Osceola this winter. Yesterday we had sunshine and robins; today it snows hard.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        We had a fine Cousins Dinner at <a href="TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie</a>'s on October 20th. I think some Cousin will surprise us with invitation for dinner when the year rolls round. The First Cousins who have received their pictures certainly appreciate <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a>'s thoughtfulness in sending one to each of us. We are all very anxious to receive our folios and hear again from all the Cousins.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terrible accidental death of Cousin <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Philip Young</a> reminds us that life is very uncertain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Others of my family will write and speak for themselves so I will close.
      </p>
      <p>
        With love to all,
      </p>
