      [A letter from 19 year old Mabel Mary Essex in Gloucestershire, to 14
      year old Inez Hoyt (later Inez Boller), daughter of Mabel's 2nd cousin,
      <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">Phoebe CAMPBELL</a> Hoyt. Mabel and Inez
      never met, but when I was a teenager I got to meet and know one of
      Mabel's brothers, the Rev. Cannon <a href=
      "http://wc.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I154">
      Edward Claude Essex</a>, who often spoke of Mabel. I did eventually get
      to visit the Stroud Valley, but not the villages of Minchinhampton or
      Stroud.I inherited the handwritten original, because Inez raised my
      mother (who was her niece and heir). - wbt]

        &nbsp;My Dear Cousin,
      </p>

    <div>
      <p>
        I am taking a great liberty in writing to you, but hope you will not be
        offended, we were all so very pleased to receive a letter from you,
        &amp; dear <a href="HoytInez1871.html">Miss Hoyt</a> I wish we were
        near each other to enjoy ourselves together. I have but one female
        cousin of the same age as myself, &amp; I do not see her very often; so
        I thought I would make bold &amp; write to you. I hope you do not get
        so much wet in your country as we get here for it seems as if we are
        always having rain, but I suppose we must not complain, but suppose it
        is sent for some wise purpose. My brother has shown me the letter &amp;
        I hope you possess good eyes, if not you had better borrow someone's
        eye glasses to aid you I hear from my <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I130">
        father</a> that you have but one brother so you cannot realize what I
        have to under go, I have five &amp; I only wish you could hear the
        noise they make sometimes, enough to send one distracted.

        Mother</a> is gone to London a week or two, so I have to stand in her
        place. I am very sure you will set me down as a very sour customer, but
        they tell me I am older in ways, than in years, so you must overlook
        this, knowing the cause thereof. I hope you will soon give us the
        pleasure of seeing your photograph, we admire <a href=

        Cousin Grace</a>'s very much. I think the Nelson People are better
        artists than our <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroud">Stroud</a> folks are. I am
        afraid that I shall tire you with all this epistle, &amp; it is time
        for me to retire. I will close this with the fondest love to yourself
        &amp; dearest, Miss Hoyt &amp; my kindest regards to Mr.
        Hoyt.<sup>1</sup>
