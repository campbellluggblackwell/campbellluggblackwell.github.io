          I feel very proud to be asked to contribute a letter to the Campbell
          Cousins Correspondence. It was a grand idea of Cousin <a href=
          "SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a>'s to get us in touch by
          letter, with all the large number belonging to the Campbell Clan.

          We live in Johnson City; N. Y. (near Binghamton), in "The Valley of
          Fair Play". Have been married nine years on Armistice Day, so we
          celebrate twice that day.

          old on next New Years Day. He is in "A" Kindergarten<sup>1</sup>.

          My husband is the leather buyer for five of Endicott?Johnson Shoe
          Factories. He is in the leather markets in the East several times
          each year. Last year, I drove with him on one trip to Philadelphia
          and visited <a href="BuckMyra1884.html">Cousin Myra Buck</a> Seiders
          at Wenonah, N. J.
        </p>
        <p>
          Endicott and Johnson City are the homes of the largest shoe factories
          under one head in the world. There are over 16,000 employees making
          125,000 pairs of shoes a day. Eighty per cent of the population of
          each town are shoe workers.

            1. At that time Binghamton &amp; Johnson City schools allowed
            students to either begin a grade in Sept. and complete it in June;
            or to begin a grade in January and complete it in the following
            January. The first semester, whether Fall or Spring was "A", and
            the 2nd semester was "B")- wbt

            maintained by the Endicott?Johnson Corporation. Several thousand
            dwellings have been built and sold at cost to workers on monthly
            payment plans. Dining rooms are connected with the factories where
            the workers can eat a good meal for fifteen cents.

            Last week the factories were closed two days for the Binghamton
            Fair, so we drove to Nelson and visited <a href=
            "LoopStella1863.html">Mama</a>. It is such a pleasure to go home
            and we always come back loaded with all the good things a garden
            grows. It is true Mama's heart is bigger than she is.

            On our way home, we stopped at <a href=

            Treva</a>'s, in Elmira Heights, and found her enjoying the music
            from a new "<a href=

            I am looking forward to the October Report as I know it is going to
            be splendid. The photographs of so many Cousins, some of whom we
            have never seen, will keep us busy during the winter studying their
            faces.
