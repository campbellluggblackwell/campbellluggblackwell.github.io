        1. In the upper left corner of the stationary there is an embossed image of a building -- unidentified so far. John was born on a farm that was then "near Pittsburgh," but apparently later became part of Pittsburgh's North Side. The farm he retired from was in McCandless Twp., Allegheny Co., PA. His new home, at Dehaven Station, on Murray Ave., is in present Allison Park, Hampton Twp., Allegheny Co. I have visited his grave in nearby Hampton Cem.-wbt
