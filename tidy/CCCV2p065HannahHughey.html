        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I surely have enjoyed reading and re-reading the letters from the
        different Cousins. I guess you all know that dear <a href=
        "HugheyHerbert1857.html">Herbert</a> would have enjoyed them.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        We have had a remarkable winter for Minnesota. Only about two weeks of
        real winter and that came right after New Years. The roads have been
        fine for cars all winter. Just now we are very busy with the spring
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I expect that <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1244">
        Mary</a> will teach school nearer home next year. I will be glad for we
        get lonesome to see her.
      </p>
      <p>

        J. Edgar</a> has just gone with his family to Tacoma, Washington. He
        had to get off the farm on account of his eyes. For three years he has
        been having trouble with his eyes, caused by hemorrhages. The Doctors
        at the Mayo Hospital at Rochester, Minnesota, told him it was caused by
        his teeth. They ordered nine pulled and now they tell him he must have
        the rest of the upper ones pulled. I hope that Edgar or his <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1223">
        wife</a> will write to the Cousins this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party began with a hike in the nature of a hare and hound race.
        Miss Allie and I led the chase, starting a full half hour before the
        rest, strewing confetti in our wake. The hounds followed and we led
        them around for over two hours scaling buttes, crossing fields, running
        down lanes and following the river until at last we returned to the
        starting point.
      </p>

        It is natural for a grandma to think her grandchildren are all right
        and so I am no exception. I am proud of <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1204">
        Carrie</a>'s two children and Edgar's two children.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to thank the Cousins who so kindly remembered us at Christmas
        time. I wish I could come East this fall and be with you at <a href=
        "CongdonCharles1856.html">Cousin Charley</a>'s at the
        Dinner<sup>1</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think we should all take off our hats to Cousin <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a>. He surely does not leave any
        stones unturned. I am glad he has some of the Cousins to help in this
        C.C.C. work now. We would be glad to have the Cousins one and all come
        to see us. Why not plan to come here and we will take you to some of
        our beautiful lakes to fish. We have fine roads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Will close with love to you all.
