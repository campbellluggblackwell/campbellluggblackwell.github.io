        Fannie Monroe (not wanting her name on record) gave a wonderful
        address. She reminded us of how our forefathers built about the home
        and the church. She urged us to do likewise, not neglecting the family
        alter [sic]. She believes we should carry our religion into politics.

        Mr. Butler</a> who is just recovering from a seriously injured back.
        Closing with remarks that he feared we as American people forget that
        the home is a divine as well as an American institution.

      <p>
        Cousin Sam Hazlett<sup>1</sup> said that 72 or 73 yrs. ago the first
        reunion was started. It was just a Hazlett Reunion. Later the Campbell
        and Hazeletts [sic] joined.<sup>2</sup>

        <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel Shaw</a> said she thought for the
        sake of our ancestors we should keep up these Reunions. She gave this
        poem in closing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "Isn't it queer that princes and kings<br>
        And clowns that caper in sawdust rings,<br>
        And common folks like you &amp; me are builders for eternity<br>
        To each is given a bag of tools, a shapless mass and a book of
        rules<br>
        And each must fashion ere life has flown<br>
        A stumbling block or a stepping stone."

      Signed: <a href=
      "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1671">
      Myra L. Campbell</a>,Secretary
    </div>
    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. This could have been either <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I280">
        Samuel H. Hazlett</a> or <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I219">
        Samuel C. Hazlett</a>. My guess would be the latter because both his
        daughters were active in the reunion and were present.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Whichever Sam said that was, at least in part, mistaken or confused.
        He may be correct about the Hazlett Reunion starting in 1873 or '74.
        But he was mistaken about the start of the Campbell Reunions. See
        <a href="ReunionMinutes1893.html">1893 Campbell Reunion minutes</a> and
        <a href="ReunionMinutes1894.html">1894 Campbell Reunion minutes</a>.
        There was a short time when they were called "Campbell-Hazlett"
        Reunions, see <a href="ReunionNewsClip1901.html">1901 News Clip</a>.,
        but by 1903 it was again just <a href="ReunionNewsClip1903.html">"the
        Campbell Reunion"</a>. I have no idea when Hazlett Reunions ended.<br>
        Also, keep in mind that except for a couple of unrelated Hazletts that
        moved to the area later, all of the Hazletts in PA's Tioga Co. &amp;
        NY's Steuben &amp; Chemung Cos. were descendants of either <a href=
        "CampbellSarah1777.html">Sarah (Campbell)</a> Hazlett or of her sister,
        <a href="CampbellJane1792.html">Jane (Campbell)</a> Hazlett and thus of
        their parents, <a href="CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph</a> &amp;
        <a href="">Mary (Harper)</a> Campbell. All these Hazletts are Campbells
        as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. She was in KY as a missionary. Her father was a minister and her
        sister Mary died while a missionary in Nicaragua.
