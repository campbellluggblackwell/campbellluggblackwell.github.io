        Dear Cousins:-

        I feel like a young girl writing his first book which is to be published and read through the land.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been kept very busy this year by being a member of the First M.E. Church Choir, Basketball Squad I, Girl Scouts, and Victor High School Sophomore Class. In Basketball I am Center Guard on the first team. We have played eght league games or which we have won five. We have three more to play. Our games are usually played every Friday night. Not long ago, the 15th of February, the Parent-Teacher Association had a special Athletic Program, at which "Dick" Harlow of Colgate University and "Eddie" Tryon, All-American-Half-Back, also of Colgate, talked to us on "Athletics in the School". Mr. Tryon presented to the members of both the boy's and girl's first teams, "Insignia", or gold mounted V's, which is quite an honor. We are all quite proud of them. By "them" I mean the V's and the team too.

        In the Girl Scouts everyone is busy working on Merit badges. In school the Sophomores and Freshmen classes are forever active together. We have parties, school socials and special detention classes after school. About three night out of five you can usually find two-thirds of each class in Detention Hall and it is because we are asking about our lessons, for we never talk about Basket Ball and parties in school.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Sunday School Class once a month plans to have a social time and one hour of this time we use to study and discuss a book of the Bible such as "John or Acts". I enjoy all of this except Detention Class for there is usually a senior or two to spoil our fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am very sorry I was not able to be at the Cousins Dinner and see you all. I have been quite sick this week and will be glad to get back to school and even to Detention Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will now sign off, looking forward to the great number of letters in the New Volume.
