        Dear Cousins:

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Having received several reminders of the time for our next letter, I will spare a few moments to let you know my family and myself are all in very good health.
      </p>
      <p>
        My <a href="TubbsAnn1855.html">mother</a> informed me this morning that she has the honor of sending in the first letter this time and after all is said and done, mother never slights her duty.

        Have been very busy since January 1st; and from now on, for six or seven months, my business will require all my time. As undoubtedly some of you know, the milk business goes on for seven days a week and in the summer time we handle between 190,000 and 200,000 pounds of fresh milk daily, all of which is made into the famous "Pet" brand Evaporated Milk<sup>1</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regretting that this letter is rather late and hoping all are in the best of health, I am

      1. Ross was manager of the creamery in Elkland, PA. Apparently he did work extremely hard that year. Before the year ended, in spite of his statement above about being in good health, he dropped dead at his desk at age 29. If I recall correctly what his daughter Marian told me, it was a massive heart attack.
