        Dear Cousins:-

      <p>
        Another year has rolled around with little change in our home. The past
        winter has been an exceptional one for Baker, and it hardly seems
        possible that summer is nearly here with all of its joys before us.
        Being 3,500 feet up in the air we expect lots of zero weather and snow
        for five months at least, but this winter I have shoveled my 200 feet
        only once and the girls skates have rusted on the hook. There is lots
        of snow in the mountains so we are assured a goodly amount for
        irrigation which is quite necessary to insure good crops for the
        farmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are enjoying a visit with <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I787">
        father</a> and <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">mother</a> and we are
        surely putting in full time for they inform us they will soon be on
        their way East and just at the time of year when we would like so much
        to keep them. Our fishing season opens on the 15th, which will find us
        up at our cottage on Wallowa Lake where father and I hope to hook into
        some of those big eight pound rainbows. Of course after his fishing
        experience in Florida this may be tame sport for him, but I am still
        willing to bet my money on the Oregon rainbow and steelhead as the King
        of all game fish.

        We are having considerable excitement in Baker over the finding of huge
        copper deposits about ten miles from this city. Eastern capital is now
        taking over one of the largest properties, and we are in hopes it will
        mean considerable to the future of our city.

        The State encampment of the Spanish-War Veterans are meeting with us in
        July, and as a member of the Executive Committee and Secy-Treas. of the
        affair my hands are about full. <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I823">
        Helen</a>'s and my interest in the Spanish-War Veterans and the
        American Legion with their Auxiliaries keep us going, and with a
        reunion of Scottish Rite in April and October, believe fraternally we
        are doing our share.

        John</a> is getting to to be some boy. He will be six this fall and
        starting school, and we of course will lose our baby for they certainly

        I am so late with my letter that I am going to "Air Mail" it to New
        York. Our Air Mail service started last week so we feel we are on the
        map now.&nbsp;
