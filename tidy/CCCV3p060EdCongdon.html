        Dear Cousins All:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        The time for the exchange of letters has arrived again, and I think I
        am a little late. Our present address in New Port Richey, but our home
        address is 5422 South Pine Street, Tacoma, Washington.
      </p>
      <p>
        After being retired from a long service of forty-five years with the
        Northern Pacific Railroad, my good <a href=
        "VaughanEmma1854.html">wife</a> and I thought we had earned a good
        rest, so we left our home in Tacoma on September fifteenth, and for the
        past seven months have been touring and visiting in Florida and amid
        the scenes of our childhood days that we left forty-five years ago. Oh,
        how changed they are! Many of the familiar faces of those days have
        gone, never to return, but I suppose we should live in the present and
        not in the past, and look up on the bright spots, of which we have
        many.
      </p>
      <p>
        We came East over the Canadian Pacific route as we had never been over
        that route before. It was a grand trip over mountains and through vast
        wheatfields, by beautiful lakes and rivers, from Vancouver, B.C., to
        Buffalo, N.Y., six days and nights on the sleeper. From Buffalo to
        Elmira where Cousin <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1544">
        Grace Carey</a> and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1566">
        husband</a> met us and gave us a warm welcome. We went home with them
        and spent the night, and the next morning Cousin Grace drove up to
        Watkins<sup>1</sup> where sister <a href="CongdonEmma1848.html">Emma
        Buck</a> met us. Grace took us all to the <a href=
        "http://books.google.com/books?id=ThecwUCYE84C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=%22jefferson+house%22+%2B+%22watkins+glen%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cn7fLgcOUZ&amp;sig=26kmXc4mpF7ia5Wszio6P-Bt1is&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r8nkUZZ67rLgA7G8gbgH&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jefferson%20house%22%20%2B%20%22watkins%20glen%22&amp;f=false">
        Jefferson House</a> for dinner. This we enjoyed very much. Then Grace
        motored home that evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        We spent several days with Sister Emma. Then, as the time was drawing
        near for the Cousins Dinner at Brother <a href=
        "CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie</a>'s home at Marshalls
        Falls<sup>2</sup>, we took the train over the D.L.&amp;W. for
        Stroudsburg. It was a wonderful trip over the hills and mountains
        covered with all the glorious tints of the fall foliage, and through
        the beautiful little villages nestling in the valleys. Sister Em went
        with us. We were there several days before the dinner and enjoyed the
        visit with Charlie, <a href=

        Bernice</a> was still in California, however. This we very much
        regretted.

        The Cousins Dinner was held October fifteenth, and at the table were
        seated about twenty-five of the cousins. Among those present were

        Perhaps I have not remembered all of the names, but we know they were
        there and we did enjoy them so much. We all enjoyed the sumptuous
        dinner and lingered at the table for speeches, stories and
        reminiscences until the committee reminded us it was time to do the
        dishes, whereupon we who were exempt scattered around the grounds and
        visited the beautiful falls and the woods and rustic bridges and
        wandered through the quaint old Titania House.<sup>4</sup>

        Some of the guests were obliged to leave that day, but several remained
        all night, and gathered in the parlor where a big fire-place with a
        bright fire blazing within and lighted candles made a wonderfully cozy
        and happy picture. We all hated to break away from it, but the small
        hours were drawing near, and so the good-nights were said. The scene
        will always remain as one of the bright spots in our visit to this
        wonderful country.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next morning dawned bright and part of the guests left early for
        the long trip home. In the afternoon Myra and her husband, Sister Em
        and my wife and myself left for Philadelphia. It was a glorious trip,
        down the Delaware River and over the hills, with everything ablaze with
        autumn colors. We arrived in Philadelphia about dark. The city was
        beautiful with its bright lights and fine buildings. We spent several
        days with Myra and Billy, and then they drove us to George Buck's where
        we spent a lovely week.
      </p>
      <p>
        George has a fine home in the quaint town of Madison, New Jersey. We
        had some fine drives though those old historic places. Charlie came and
        spent one day there with us. This we enjoyed very much. He then took
        the train for New York City. The next we heard of him, he was on his
        way to Los Angeles, California. We left George's the last of the week
        and spent a day and night in Binghamton with my wife's brother. Then we
        went to Watkins. We were all pretty tired when we got there, and so
        spent several days in resting. Then Sister Em, my wife and I left for a
        visit up the <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowanesque_River">Cowanesque Valley</a>
        among the cousins.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was the most wonderful trip of all. We left about eight o'clock in
        the morning and arrived in Westfield about six that night, a trip of
        about fifty miles. I can't describe it. It was beyond description. We
        arrived in safety and had such a good time that we just hated to think
        of leaving. Our visit was all too short, and maybe they did not see too
        much of us because most of them invited us to come again next spring,
        so we have that to look forward to.

        4. This was resort hotel, having 35 rooms. In 1897 its proprietor was
        T. J. Wolfe, but at least from 1903 to 1909, Charlie Congdon was its
        proprietor. At that time he was living in Chicago and had started his
        music and textbook publishing business, and if I recall correctly, was
        in charge of choral music for the Chicago schools. It was "beautifully
        situated in an enclosed park of fifteen acres, embracing the well known
        and universally admired Marshall's Falls (distant from the hotel by
        about 200 yards). This place has been called Hygiene Park on account of
        the salubrity of the air and general healthfulness. House has all
        latest improvements, sanitary plumbing, baths, etc.; tables supplied
        with the best the market affords, and fresh vegetables from nearby
        farms; conveyance from train when notified." I'm not certain of its
        status in 1925, but it was very near Charlie's summer home (or may have
        served as his summer home). The building still stands, and the township
        has purchased it and the surrounding land to be a park. I hope to go
        see it before long --- perhaps in October when the foliage will be as
        Ed described.

        In the Cowanesque <span class="Annotation">[Valley]</span> it began to
        get pretty cold. We left Cousin Jennie Cady's early one cold morning
        and went to Mansfield to visit Cousins <a href=
        "CampbellMary1851.html">Mary Shipman</a> and <a href=
        "ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel</a> and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I773">
        Llewellyn Shaw</a>. If that name isn't spelled right, please excuse the
        mistake. The name is almost as large as he is. We spent several days in
        Mansfield and has such a good time. Cousin Mary was not able to be
        downstairs with us, so of course we had to make her room our
        headquarters, and we had some good visits there. We are so glad to know
        that Cousin Mary is better now, and when we get back up that way will
        be so glad to see her walking about. Mabel and her husband made us a
        flying visit last summer. This we enjoyed as much as we could for so
        short a time, but maybe they will try to come some other time.
      </p>
      <p>
        After our lively visit at Mansfield we went back to Sister Em's at
        Watkins and spent several weeks. We were there for Christmas. Then as
        the cold pinched us and the snow scared us, we left for Florida as we
        had planned to spend the winter here.
      </p>
      <p>
        We left Watkins the fifth of January and arrived in St. Petersburg on
        the tenth. We stayed overnight in Washington, D.C., with Cousin
        <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1050">
        Mary Snavely</a> and had a short visit with Cousin <a href=
        "CraneJennie1852.html">Jennie Bosard</a> who was very ill. Since then
        she has passed away. One of the salt of the earth was Jennie. Her
        children have our heartfelt sympathy in their loss. We also had a short
        visit with Cousin <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Ann Owlett</a> who was
        staying with Mary and helping to care for Jennie. We expect to stop on
        our way North and spend a few days with Mary and her family.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we arrived in St. Petersburg Cousin <a href=
        "CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a> met us at the station and gave us
        a warm welcome. When we left Washington there was heavy snow and they
        were cleaning the streets that morning, and I think before they got it
        cleaned they had another heavy snow storm. There was snow almost all
        the way to Jacksonville, but from there on it was fine-- flowers and
        orange and grapefruit groves; and when we got into St. Petersburg with
        its wonderful climate, and the warm reception from Cousins <a href=
        "ParksFrances1855.html">Frank</a> and Tommie, we certainly thought
        there was nothing lacking for our happiness and pleasure in Florida.
      </p>
      <p>

        Lish</a> and <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Kate</a> have been here
        all winter, and that has been another big factor in our pleasant time.
        We certainly have enjoyed them. Seemed we has never known them before.
        They have built themselves a little bungalow so that when they come
        back next winter they will have their own home into which to go. We had
        the pleasure of going there for dinner the day before we left for New
        Port Richey where we are at present visiting with old Brainerd friends
        and having a

        Tommie is a very busy man. I would like to tell you of his wonderful
        subdivision and his work, but this letter is getting too long, and I

        Campbell House and spent the winter there. <a href=
