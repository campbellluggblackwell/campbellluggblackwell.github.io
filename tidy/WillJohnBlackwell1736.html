    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. There are a number of interesting things about this will. John Blackwell had 10 children by his first wife <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cole-14464">Sarah Cole</a>: 7 sons and 3 daughters. And none by 2nd wife, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Barrett-9423">Frances Barrett</a>, or 3rd wife, Mary Saunders. He was predeceased by two of his daughters, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-3670">Sarah (Blackwell</a>) Barnfield and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-3673">Phebe Blackwell</a>; and by sons <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-3668">John</a> and Enoch. His will does not mention his daughters, but does mention one of Sarah's sons, Edward Barnfield. Why none of his other grandchildren are mentioned is a mystery. As is why daughter <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-3671">Lucretia (Blackwell</a>) Perrin is not mentioned, nor sons Thomas and Joshua. Perhaps it's because Lucretia, Thomas and Joshua "left him" and went to America. But so did Enoch and Peter who are mentioned. We don't know for sure why he singled out one daughter-in-law to mention. But he was 86 at the time of making this will and "in weak state of health," so it may that she was his primary caregiver, but his wife Mary was only 30 ---- younger than any of John's children.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Estimates vary. But each 1820 pound sterling would be at the very least $109.18 US 2014. Some estimates place it 100 times higher, depending on the assumptions made. Enoch had 9 children, but one died young. So a bequest of £70 would come to the equivalent of at least $955 2014 each -- possibly several hundred times more. And £30 worth of brandy would have been a heck of a lot of gallons.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. I wonder what went into the decision of how much to give to each: need, merit or what.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Edward had three sisters and a brother, but he was the eldest son. That might explain why his siblings were not included in the will, but not why none of the other grandchildren were singled out.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. "For convenience, trustees always hold as joint tenants. A grant to A and B and their heirs made a joint tenancy. Tenants in common hold undivided portions as separate beings, and their respective shares pass to their heirs, etc."
