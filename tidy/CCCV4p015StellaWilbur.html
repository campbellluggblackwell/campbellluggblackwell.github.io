        Dear Cousins:-

    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Good evening everybody! Now this is to be a regular cleanup letter. I
        have wanted to write to several of the Cousins this winter (it is still
        winter here) but have been prevented by circumstances, so this will
        have to do for everybody.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every time I read over the Cousins' letters, I can think of so many
        things to say to the various Cousins, but when I begin writing I cannot
        think of anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has been a real winter here in Nelson. My pump has been frozen up
        most of the time<sup>1</sup>, but I have good neighbors so we have
        managed to survive up to now. This has been an eventful year, in the
        Cousin families too. Sorrow, sickness and joy for some.
      </p>

        Well, did you ever see a finer looking bunch than the ones at <a href=
        "TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie Clark</a>'s<sup>2</sup>? It was a
        terrible day, and of course I had a broken rib, but everything was
        alright after we got into the house.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course you are all interested in the Old Church<sup>3</sup>. We have
        a fine Minister now, in fact we always do have the best kind, but they
        are always moving up so we have a change all to frequently. Last fall
        the men had a new roof put on, and this Spring the "Ladies Aid" will do
        the rest and clean up on the inside. How we do love the Old Church, but
        our generation will soon be gone, and will our children and their
        children remember it?<sup>3</sup>

        1. Lots of people in small towns and farms then did not have indoor
        plumbing. A well in the yard, near the kitchen door, would have a long
        handled pump. Usually they worked pretty well, but sometimes a leather
        gasket in the pump would dry out and you needed to have some water
        available to pour into the pump, to "prime" it. And some models of pump
        were susceptible to freezing when the weather got unusually cold.

        2. The 1925 Campbell Cousins dinner was held at Minnie's home in
        Osceola.

        3. Nelson's Beechers Island Presbyterian Church.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Stella's generation and their children are long gone. As of 2013,
        those of their grandchildren who survive are, like me, elderly. /after
        the relocation of Nelson to make way for Cowanesque Lake, the remaining
        population was too small to support both a Presbyterian congregation
        and a Methodist congregation. They combined, used the Methodists'
        building, and eventually the abandoned Presbyterian building fell into
        disrepair and was demolished about 40 years ago, so the number of
        people who attended a service there, or have even seen the building
        with their own eyes is rapidly shrinking. But the resulting
        congregation remains. See: <a href=

        Nelson</a>.

        I thought last Spring that I would surely write to <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1204">
        Carrie</a> and <a href=

        Mary Hughey</a> right away, but I did not do it. <a href=
        "CampbellElizabeth1830.html">Aunt Lib</a>'s little house next door to
        me is for sale now, and if I could spare the money would buy it and fix
        it up. I can remember it so well, and I think the first dollar I ever
        earned was there. Aunt Lib was sick in bed and <a href=
        "HugheyHerbert1857.html">Herby</a> had the measles, so I stayed a week
        and helped and Uncle Dan gave me a silver dollar. Shortly after that, I
        went to Osceola for a visit and I bought a calico dress from <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I450">
        Truman Crandall</a>'s Store. Those were great days. And now I think
        that this Cousins Letter scheme is the most wonderful thing that has
        ever happened for us. Just to sit down and read over the letters, it
        brings us all together so easily. Now when every one is so busy, there
        isn't time for a good visit with any one.

        It has been so icy and cold all winter that <a href=
        "HoytInez1871.html">Inez</a> has not been here as often as usual, and
        <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Ann Owlett</a>, is "ruined entirely", for
        ever living in Nelson again. I think <a href=
        "CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a> is the only March Cousin there is,
        and from all I hear they don't have March in Florida.
      </p>

        Well I must ring off and give some one else a chance<sup>5</sup>.

        Everyone around here enjoys reading the Cousins letters. My books are
        all down to <a href=

        5. An analogy with the "party line" telephone service that was the norm
        back then. Four to eight houses would share the same telephone #. So,
        you had to finish your conversation and hang up, before any other
        household sharing that line could make a call. For the same reason,
        anyone in the other houses sharing your phone # could pick up and
        listen to your conversations. Each household had a distinctive ring, so
        that when the phone rang, you would know if it was for your house or
        for one of the other houses.
