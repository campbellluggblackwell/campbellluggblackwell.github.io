        <span class="Annotation"></span>Although this is the first time I have
        written in, I have not much to say as <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1544">

      <p>
        After leaving college last June, I devoted the summer months to selling
        cars, with indifferent success. The latter part of September, I started
        to work for an investment banking house in Buffalo. After taking about
        a month's preliminary training in that city, I returned to Elmira in
        November to start in my work as a bond salesman. Selling bonds has
        given me a lot of wonderful experience but unfortunately that item does
        not show up in your bank account.
      </p>
      <p>
        At present, I am negotiating for another job out of town, which, if it
        materializes, will present a wonderful opportunity. I severed my
        connection with the Buffalo house about a month ago but am dealing
        independently in bonds until I become permanently located.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just at present I am in Philadelphia, having driven down from Elmira
        yesterday. I expect to stay here today to see the Penn Relays and then
        travel down to Princeton for the weekend. After that, I expect to
        include New York in my itinerary. After I really start to work,
        vacations will be so limited that I want to surfeit myself now so as to
        make up for the drought that is coming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being in Elmira so much of the time, I have been enabled to see many of
        the Cousins. However, I feel that I have not kept in touch with them as
        I might, but I hope to rectify this condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cousins Book seems to be the logical way of keeping the ties closer
        and promises to be even more valuable in that respect as years go on. I
        hope to make my next contribution more interesting.
