        W. A. Ellison</a> at Tioga, February 14, 1881. She was the mother of
        two children: <a href=

        Edna Alice</a>, born December 29, 1883, and <a href=
        "EllisonHugh1888.html">Hugh Campbell</a>, born April 3, 1888. The
        parents of Mrs. Ellison died in the year 1875. She is survived by two
        sisters and two brothers: <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">Mrs. G. H.
        Shipman</a> of Mansfield; <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Mrs. E. S.
        Horton</a> of Mass, Michigan; <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">T. C.
        Campbell</a> of Knoxville, and <a href="CampbellWilliam1864.html">W. C.
        Campbell</a> of Marinette, Wis.</big>

      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since their marriage Mr. and Mrs. Ellison
        have lived in Tioga, Knoxville, Potterbrook, Harrison Valley and during
        the past five years, in Elkland. Mrs. Ellison became a Christian at the
        early age of twelve years and during her later years had been drawn
        into a still closer companionship with her savior. Those who knew her
        can testify that her faith was no meer creed, but wrought in reality
        into her daily live in practical kindness and helpfulness and in
        self-denying sweetness of character.</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That she was loved and esteemed is
        evident from the fact that the M. E. Church was filled to overflowing
        on Sunday afternoon with those who met to pay the last tribute to her
        memory. The services were conducted by Rev. W. H. Henderson, who chose
        for his text the triumphant words of Paul found in 2 Tim. 4:7-8. He was
        assisted in the service by Rev. T. C. Easson. The W. C. T. U., of which
        Mrs. Ellison was an honored and faithful members, attended the services
        in a body. The remains were taken to Nelson for internment.</big>
