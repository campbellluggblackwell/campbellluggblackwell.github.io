        Dear Cousins:

      <p>
        The spring sunshine of a fine March day would seem to indicate that
        spring cannot be far behind. And yet, I have lived in New England long
        enough to know that we may have a blizzard tomorrow, and the one
        hopeful thing is, that by the time this letter reaches you, spring will
        certainly have arrived.
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, I can report that my family enjoys perfect health, and
        that my son <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1509">
        Philip</a><sup>1</sup> admits that he is the best reader in his class
        at kindergarten, and my son <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1515">
        John</a><sup>2</sup> can get muddier than any other descendant of
        <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph</a> and <a href=
        "ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann Campbell</a>.

        Perhaps the only interesting thing that has happened to me since my
        last letter was a trip to Europe the first of the year. I sailed
        January 5th on the "Aquitania", one of the largest of the Cunard
        <span class="Annotation">[Line]</span> steamships, and landed in
        Southampton, England, A busy week was spent in London in search of new
        things in golf stockings<sup>3</sup> and fine English neckwear for men.
        I saw three good shows, one of them at the London Hippodrome, whose
        feature act was a Paul Whitman Jazz Band. I also saw "Blossom-time"
        [sic], an opera which I had once seen in New York, and an American
        movie -- "Down to the Sea in Ships". "The Covered Wagon" and
        "Scaramouche" were also playing in London to packed houses at much
        higher prices than we can see them here. As usual, it rained all the
        time I was there.
      </p>
      <p>
        After one night in Paris, I took the <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orient_Express">Orient Express</a> to
        Vienna, thirty-two hours ride, and continued the search for similar
        merchandise there. Vienna is a ghost of its former gayness<sup>4</sup>.
        The streets are dirty, the buildings are grimy, windows are broken and
        people generally not well dressed. However, they have plenty of work
        and food now, and consider themselves far better off than three or four
        years ago when they actually were hungry<sup>5</sup>. The people were
        all at work and had plenty of orders to keep them busy for months to
        come.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Orient Express goes directly across Switzerland. I had two days in
        the snow covered Alps. Upon returning to Paris, I spent several days,
        and by far the<br>

      1. I wish I had known Phil. True to his start as the best reader in his
      kindergarten class, he became a widely recognized authority on the
      writings of Ernest Hemingway. If I recall correctly, at Penn State he was
      a colleague of, and mentor of, Cousin Bonnie LUGG Kyofski. Also, he was
      popular as a pianist in jazz groups. He sounds like an interesting person
      to be admired both in academia and the music worlds - wbt.<br>
      <br>
      2. I'm in touch with children of both Philip and John - wbt.<br>
      <br>
      3. He was a buyer for a Boston department store. In the 1920s, golfers
      wore knickers and knee socks. At this time, Roswell was the President of
      the Campbell Cousins Correspondence Club.<br>
      <br>
      4. It took years for Vienna to recover from WW1 and the end of the
      Austria-Hungarian Empire.<br>
      <br>
      5. There was starvation after WW1. Future president Herbert Hoover, our
      1st Quaker president (Nixon was the 2nd) became know to the public as
      head of the US' humanitarian relief program.<br>

      most delightful part of that visit was an evening spent with Cousin
      <a href=
      "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1478">
      Harry Campbell</a> and his family in their apartment on the Avenue
      Charles Floquet. After a delightful dinner, served in the French manner,
      we had two tables of bridge, and late in the evening I succeeded in
      getting Harry to sing<sup>6</sup>, a most pleasant experience. He expects
      to remain in Paris at least another year, and his two small
      daughters<sup>7</sup> seem to enjoy French life exceedingly.

        I sailed for home on the January 26th on the French Liner "Paris," the
        largest of the French boats. The second day out I went to bed with
        influenza and had a very quiet trip home. <a href=

        Katherine</a> met me in New York and we were obliged to stay there a
        week before I was able to complete the trip and get back on the
        job.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Katherine and I were in Elmira two weeks ago and I spent a very
        pleasant day with my <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1501">
        sister</a> and <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">father</a>.

        Please let me repeat an earnest invitation to any Campbell Cousin, by
        chance motoring through New England, to look up Wellesley Hills and
        make us a call.

      6. Roswell's 1st cousin Harry was an opera singer, at that time studying
      at a conservatory in Paris. He sang professionally in Europe and the US,
      then became head of vocal music at NY State's college for music
      education, in Potsdam.<br>

      Catherine or Jane.
