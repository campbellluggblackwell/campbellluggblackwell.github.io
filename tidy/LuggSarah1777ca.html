    <h1>
      Sarah LUGG Clinch Blackwell Campbell (ca 1777 - 1867)
    </h1>
    <p>
      Sarah was born abt. 1777 in Bisley, Gloucestershire, Eng., d. Jan. 21, 1867 in Nelson, Tioga Co., PA (originally called <a href="BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's Island</a>).&nbsp; Sarah's parents were <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I31">Robert Lugg</a>, b. Dec. 15, 1750 in Bisley, Gloucestershire, Eng., d. Mar. 27, 1831 in Bisley; and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I30">Ann Ely</a>, b. Aug. 1754 in Bisley. Sarah was the oldest of seven children. The sixth, <a href="LuggCharles1791.html">Charles Byron Lugg</a>, later emigrated to Nelson.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the first "connecting link" tying our Luggs, Clinches, Blackwells and Campbells together. And, although there were many intermarriages later, she's probably the only one to connect all four lines together.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah married:<br>
      1st) March 27, 1803 in England, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I20">Thomas Clinch</a>, b. in England, d. 1805 in NYC of yellow fever;<br>
      2nd) Sept. 9, 1805 in Jersey Shore, PA, <a href="BlackwellEnoch1764ca.html">Enoch Blackwell</a>, b. abt 1764 in Avening, Gloucestershire, d. Jun. 3, 1816 in Jersey Shore, Lycoming Co., PA; and<br>
      3rd) <a href="CampbellJohn1761.html">John Campbell</a>, b. 1761 in Scotland, d. 1854, presumably in Nelson.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Clinch was apparently the second of 8 children of <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I28">John Clinch</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I29">Elizabeth (or Sarah) Lucas</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Enoch Blackwell apparently was the second of 10 children of <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2434">John Blackwell</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2435">Sarah Cole</a>. Enoch first married <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I27">Hannah Perrine</a> (sometimes reported as Mary Perrin) on Dec. 3, 1783 in Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire. She died in England before he emigrated. Enoch and Hannah had 6 children, all of whom came to PA. Several of Enoch's siblings also came to PA.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah and Thomas Clinch had one child: <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann Clinch</a>, b. Jan. 27, 1804, in Gloucestershire, England, m. <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph Campbell</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah and Enoch Blackwell had two children:<br>
      <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary Blackwell</a>, b. Jun. 8, 1806 in Pine Twp., Lycoming Co., PA, m. <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James Campbell</a>; and<br>
      <a href="BlackwellEnoch1814.html">Enoch Blackwell</a>, b. June 12, 1814 in Jersey Shore, PA; m. 1st) <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2363">Mary Knapp</a>, 2nd) 1st cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2360">Caroline Lugg</a>, 3rd) <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2365">Caroline Power</a> Prutsman.<br>
      <br>
      [Mary Knapp's sister, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I642">Catherine</a>, married <a href="HazlettSamuel1816.html">Samuel Hazlett</a>, son of <a href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John</a> and <a href="CampbellJane1792.html">Jane Campbell</a> Hazlett. And her brother, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I765">William</a>, married Sam's sister, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I79">Sally Jane Hazlett</a>.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah, Thomas Clinch and baby Ann (and the Blackwell family) sailed from Bristol, Apr. 4, 1804 and landed in Philadelphia, May 17, 1804. When Ann was a year old, her father died and on Sept. 9, 1805, Sarah married Enoch Blackwell. According to Ann's daughter <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Jane CAMPBELL</a> Tubbs, Ann was sent to live with Enoch's brother, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2682">Peter Blackwell</a> in New Hope, PA. A Blackwell researcher, the late <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2956">Stella MAUGERI</a> Blackwell, believed it was with brother <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2677">Joshua Blackwell</a>, not Peter. [And I agree with Stella.]
    </p>
    <p>
      After Enoch Blackwell (the elder) died in 1816, Sarah Lugg married John Campbell and moved to Nelson. When Ann reached marrying age, Sarah wrote to her suggesting she marry John's nephew, Joseph. He traveled to meet her and Ann returned to Nelson with him in late 1821 or early 1822. A week after Ann's wedding, Ann's half-sister, Mary Blackwell, married Joseph's younger brother, James Campbell. Sarah's son, Enoch Blackwell, was the heir of John Campbell.
