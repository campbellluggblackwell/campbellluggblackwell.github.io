    <h1>
      Sarah LUGG Clinch Blackwell Campbell (ca 1777 - 1867)
    </h1>
    <p>
      Sarah was born abt. 1777 in Bisley, Gloucestershire, Eng., d. Jan. 21,
      1867 in Nelson, Tioga Co., PA (originally called <a href=
      "BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's Island</a>).&nbsp; Sarah's parents were
      <a href=
      "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I31">
      Robert Lugg</a>, b. Dec. 15, 1750 in Bisley, Gloucestershire, Eng., d.
      Mar. 27, 1831 in Bisley; and <a href=
      "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I30">
      Ann Ely</a>, b. Aug. 1754 in Bisley. Sarah was the oldest of seven
      children. The sixth, <a href="LuggCharles1791.html">Charles Byron
      Lugg</a>, later emigrated to Nelson.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the first "connecting link" tying our Luggs, Clinches, Blackwells
      and Campbells together. And, although there were many intermarriages
      later, she's probably the only one to connect all four lines
      together.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah married:<br>
      1st) March 27, 1803 in England, <a href=
      "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I20">

      Thomas Clinch was apparently the second of 8 children of <a href=

      Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire. She died in England before he emigrated.
      Enoch and Hannah had 6 children, all of whom came to PA. Several of
      Enoch's siblings also came to PA.<br>

    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah, Thomas Clinch and baby Ann (and the Blackwell family) sailed from
      Bristol, Apr. 4, 1804 and landed in Philadelphia, May 17, 1804. When Ann
      was a year old, her father died and on Sept. 9, 1805, Sarah married Enoch
      Blackwell. According to Ann's daughter <a href=
      "CampbellJane1834.html">Jane CAMPBELL</a> Tubbs, Ann was sent to live
      with Enoch's brother, <a href=
      "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2682">
      Peter Blackwell</a> in New Hope, PA. A Blackwell researcher, the late
      <a href=
      "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2956">
      Stella MAUGERI</a> Blackwell, believed it was with brother <a href=
      "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2677">
      Joshua Blackwell</a>, not Peter. [And I agree with Stella.]
    </p>
    <p>
      After Enoch Blackwell (the elder) died in 1816, Sarah Lugg married John
      Campbell and moved to Nelson. When Ann reached marrying age, Sarah wrote
      to her suggesting she marry John's nephew, Joseph. He traveled to meet
      her and Ann returned to Nelson with him in late 1821 or early 1822. A
      week after Ann's wedding, Ann's half-sister, Mary Blackwell, married
      Joseph's younger brother, James Campbell. Sarah's son, Enoch Blackwell,
      was the heir of John Campbell.
