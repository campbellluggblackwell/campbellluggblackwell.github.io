      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I95">Robert Campbell</a>, one of the oldest residents of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elkland,_Pennsylvania">this borough</a>, died at his home on West Main street yesterday morning at about 5 o'clock, in the seventy-seventh year of his age.
