        Margaret (CRAWFORD)</a> BOGGS, was born January 6, 1806, on the site of
        Evans City, Butler county, Pennsylvania. He grew to manhood under the
        parental roof, learned the miller's trade, and succeeded his father's
        business in the old mill. In 1836 he purchased seventy-six acres of
        land in Forward township, where he died April 10, 1886. He was a
        Democrat until 1855, then joined the Republican party, and was quite
        active in the political circles of his time. He was a school director
        for many years, and filled the office of county commissioner from 1855
        to 1858. He was an elder in the Plains Presbyterian church for half a
        century, being on[e] of the original members of that society. Mr. BOGGS
        was twice married, his first wife being <a href=
