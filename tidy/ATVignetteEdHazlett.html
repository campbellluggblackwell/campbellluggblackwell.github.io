        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I685">Ed Hazlett</a>'s absentmindedness was a by-word. Cowanesque Valley People had many chuckles over it. There was a whole series of anecdotes about Ed's adventures with his new fangled horseless carriage.</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first he had trouble remembering that he wasn't driving a horse. Once he hollered "Whoa", &amp; expecting it to stop got out. The car went right on, of course. He had to run after it.</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A favorite story was about Ed taking his <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I686">wife</a> to Corning shopping. On his way home to Tompkins (downstream from Nelson), he stopped to visit with a neighboring farmer. "How's your wife, Ed?" he was asked.</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed looked in surprise at her empty seat, "My God." he shouted. "I've left her in Corning.</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed was head of the local political machine.<sup>1</sup> He'd arranged for a VIP to come to speak at an important meeting. Ed &amp; the boys were at the Station to meet the dignitary's train. Naturally he got into Ed's car. There was so much to discuss that Ed paid (even) less attention to driving than usual. It was so hair-raising that the Politico jumped out yelling, "I'll walk!" Then added, "I value my life".</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1256">Tom</a><sup>2</sup> said, "Don't get the wrong idea about Ed. He was intelligent, a good businessman, a shrewd politician &amp; very articulate. The natives commented "Ed was quite a talker".</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the clan were "talkers". After G. Grandfather <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I978">H.D. Goodrich</a>'s daughter, <a href="GoodrichFrances1871.html">Frank</a> married <a href="HoytJosephD1860.html">Joe Hoyt</a>, he was invited to the Campbell Gatherings. "I'd always supposed the Scots were silent people, but I've never heard anything like the Campbells when they get together", he remarked.</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom commented on the noise level at the Campbell Cousin Reunions.<sup>3</sup> They weren't noisy or raucous, there was just a lot of talking going on.</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1591">Ed Hills</a>, old Ed Hazlett's great great nephew.<sup>4.</sup> He remembered the story about the Corning trip &amp; added some more details. The Clan descendants have long memories.</big>

        1. He was chairman of the Tioga County Republican Committee.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Anne's older brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Tom would have been talking about the Campbell Reunions of the 1930s.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. I think Anne was ill when she wrote this, which may account for her error. Ed Hills was not related to Ed Hazlett. She probably meant to write "<a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I666">Jack Hazlett</a>." Jack was Ed Hills' brother-in-law and was a nephew of Ed Hazlett.
