      senior citizens' writing class, but she hoped to preserve for her nephews
      and nieces and their descendants the stories she'd heard while growing
      up. Or descriptions of departed relatives she'd met but hoped would not
      be forgotten.)

        Ed Hazlett</a>'s absentmindedness was a by-word. Cowanesque Valley
        People had many chuckles over it. There was a whole series of anecdotes
        about Ed's adventures with his new fangled horseless carriage.</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first he had trouble remembering that
        he wasn't driving a horse. Once he hollered "Whoa", &amp; expecting it
        to stop got out. The car went right on, of course. He had to run after
        it.</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A favorite story was about Ed taking his

        wife</a> to Corning shopping. On his way home to Tompkins (downstream
        from Nelson), he stopped to visit with a neighboring farmer. "How's
        your wife, Ed?" he was asked.</big>
      </p><big></big>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed looked in surprise at her empty seat,
        "My God." he shouted. "I've left her in Corning.</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed was head of the local political
        machine.<sup>1</sup> He'd arranged for a VIP to come to speak at an
        important meeting. Ed &amp; the boys were at the Station to meet the
        dignitary's train. Naturally he got into Ed's car. There was so much to
        discuss that Ed paid (even) less attention to driving than usual. It
        was so hair-raising that the Politico jumped out yelling, "I'll walk!"
        Then added, "I value my life".</big>

        Tom</a><sup>2</sup> said, "Don't get the wrong idea about Ed. He was
        intelligent, a good businessman, a shrewd politician &amp; very
        articulate. The natives commented "Ed was quite a talker".</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the clan were "talkers". After G.
        Grandfather <a href=

        "GoodrichFrances1871.html">Frank</a> married <a href=
        "HoytJosephD1860.html">Joe Hoyt</a>, he was invited to the Campbell
        Gatherings. "I'd always supposed the Scots were silent people, but I've
        never heard anything like the Campbells when they get together", he
        remarked.</big>

      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom commented on the noise level at the
        Campbell Cousin Reunions.<sup>3</sup> They weren't noisy or raucous,
        there was just a lot of talking going on.</big>

      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called <a href=

        Ed Hills</a>, old Ed Hazlett's great great nephew.<sup>4.</sup> He
        remembered the story about the Corning trip &amp; added some more
        details. The Clan descendants have long memories.</big>

        1. He was chairman of the Tioga County Republican Committee.

      <p>
        2. Anne's older brother.

        3. Tom would have been talking about the Campbell Reunions of the
        1930s.

        4. I think Anne was ill when she wrote this, which may account for her
        error. Ed Hills was not related to Ed Hazlett. She probably meant to
        write "<a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I666">Jack
        Hazlett</a>." Jack was Ed Hills' brother-in-law and was a nephew of Ed
        Hazlett.
