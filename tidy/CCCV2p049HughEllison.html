        Dear Cousins:

      <p>
        We have taken a house out in the country for the summer; it is claimed to be on the highest point in Ontario County<sup>1</sup>. It is slightly; on a clear day we can see the Atlantic Ocean on the east and Lake Michigan on the west, but so far I have not been able to recognize <a href="CampbellWilliam1864.html">Uncle Will</a>'s place yet<sup>2</sup>, for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I879">Gertrude</a> is still going to school at Canandaigua, and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I892">Helen</a> at Victor.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are all having colds and none of us are feeling first class just now.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last of March we drove to North Brookfield, N. Y., and had dinner with Cousins <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1276">Betty</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1277">Roy Walker</a>. We certainly enjoyed our time with them, but talk about the snow in Potter County<sup>3</sup>, why down there they do not pretend to use their snow until it is two or three years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I836">Father Ellison</a> is still living in Himrod<sup>4</sup>, but is talking of going to Penn Yan<sup>4</sup> to live as <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I844">Pauline</a> is going to school there and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I842">Frances</a> is going to Keuka College.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did not want to write this letter too soon as I wanted to get in it all things of interest; but am afraid <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I876">Virginia</a> will have nervous prostration if I do not get it off now so I am writing it even though I have nothing to tell.

    <div class="Footnote">
      1. Ontario County is on the shore of Lake Ontario, and is mostly pretty flat. But it's high point (which may or may not have been where Hugh's summer home was), is Frost Hill, near Bristol Springs -- height 2,283 ft - wbt.<br>
      <br>
      2. As you have probably figured out already, Hugh liked to tell "tall tales" --- which I attribute to his being an avid fisherman. Uncle Will's place was on Green Bay, on the far side of Lake Michigan, so it's understandable if Hugh couldn't quite make it out.<br>
      <br>
      3. PA. I'm not sure what's going on with the sudden shift to talking about Potter County. Perhaps <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a>'s typists omitted a segue when they typed Hugh's letter. Perhaps he and Roy talked about fishing there (Roy was an avid fisherman too) so that might have been what brought it to mind when Hugh was writing this letter.<br>
      <br>
      4. NY.<br>
