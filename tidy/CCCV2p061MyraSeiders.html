        Dear Cousins:

      <p>
        I hope I am not too late but it seems time just flies, -- a sure sign
        of approaching old age. Days used to seem like weeks, now weeks seem
        like days.<br>
      </p>

        Right now our little town is considerably upset because of diphtheria.
        Every mother is watching anxiously for any sign of ill feeling. The
        schools are closed and every precaution is being taken. Two from
        Betty's room have it, -- one was taken sick in school. That was a week
        ago. The little girl just back of us has it. Fortunately there are no
        severe cases. Those who have not or rather are not in line for
        diphtheria are falling back on mumps as a substitute.
      </p>

        Exactly two years ago, April 16th, our little golden haired baby girl
        left us. I hope she is as happy as we are sad without her.
      </p>

        This winter hardly seemed like winter. It certainly has not been the
        old-fashioned snow bank winter. Our only hard snow was about two weeks
        ago, that was gone the next day. The spring is late, however. Usually
        by this time lilacs are out, leaves are well out, and gardens are about
        made. This year only the very earliest flowers are out. We have peas
        and onions planted, but nothing else.

        I have heard nothing more about the Cousins Dinner but suppose the
        plans are still to have it at Uncle Charlie's. I hope so, for it will
        be our wonderful chance to go and see everybody. Now that Betty is in
        school, I cannot pack up and go any time. She loves school and gets
        along nicely. She is starting music too for she has the Campbell ear
        for music.

        There is a woman in town who a few days ago told <a href=

      do so. She may be a missing "link," though perhaps it would be better to
      say "Chain" for she is more nearly a perfect 66 than 36. Would any such
      link in our family be possible?

        If any of you come near us on your summer trips look us up. A new road
        directly from Philadelphia to Atlantic City passes near here now. We
        have a big house and it is never loaded. If you find the town you can
        always find the Hardware store<sup>1</sup>, -- the only one in town. It
        meets all trains for it is just across the street from the station.

        Billy joins me in best wishes for those we do not know as well as those
        we do.
