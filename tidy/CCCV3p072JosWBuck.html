        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> has had to write
        me several times to get my April first letter started. My customary
        delay should not be attributable to my lack of interest. I have been
        very busy<sup>1</sup> and, candidly, I do find that very little has
        happened in our family in the last year that would be of particular
        interest to the cousins. <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1552">
        Marjorie</a> and the boys<sup>2</sup> have enjoyed good health this
        winter as well as myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I stated in one of my previous <a href=
        "http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Ecapane/CCCV1R2p66JosephBuck.html">
        letters</a>, I believe that this interchange of letters could serve a
        very good purpose by putting in permanent form some of the early
        history of our family. All of us remember stories and tales told by the
        older members. Unless these are written down, we shall find ourselves
        in a few years with no knowledge of what our forefathers thought and
        did.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have some very interesting old documents. Yesterday I spent a few
        hours in editing what appears to be an account book and diary started
        in 1810 by my great, great, grandfather, <a href=
        "CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph Campbell</a>. This Joseph Campbell was
        the father of my <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">great
        grandfather</a> of the same name(who was born December 24, 1793, and
        designated as the first generation on the genealogy chart<sup>3</sup>
        which was sent to all of us last year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right here I should like to make a correction on this chart. This
        Joseph Campbell was born in Scotland, and not in Ireland. When he was
        very young the family moved to Londonderry<sup>4</sup>, Ireland, where
        they lived until 1810, when they came to this country. I have heard my
        <a href="CampbellJoseph1839.html">grandfather</a> state that his father
        went to school in northern Ireland, and in so doing it was necessary
        for him to walk over the <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant%27s_Causeway">Giant's
        Causeway</a><sup>5</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a copy book belonging to the younger Joseph
        Campbell<sup>6</sup>. which was evidently prepared at this time. In
        this copy book there are problems in arithmetic in terms of English
        money and measures. This copy book was later used by my great
        grandfather<sup>6</sup> as an account book. These accounts started
        about 1817. I have also other account books extending up until about
        1840<sup>7</sup>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. Joe <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> very busy.
        He was an attorney with corporate clients such as Corning Glass.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Geo. W. Buck and the late Jos. Campbell Buck. Many cousins met Jos.
        C. Buck at a Campbell Reunion. I've never met George, but have talked
        with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. A large spread sheet style table of the descendants of Jos. and Ann
        Clinch Campbell. Will had a draftsman create this, then he sent free
        copies to all his 1st cousins. Copies are usually available at the
        Campbell Reunions.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. The English like to call it 'Londonderry'. Irish Catholics prefer
        just 'Derry'.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Note that this formation extends beneath the straight and is
        viewable on Argyl's Kintyre Peninsula (only 13 miles away) and the
        Hebrides. But of importance to us, is that the place where the Causeway
        hits the coast is abt. 35 miles from Londonderry and encompasses abt. 4
        miles of the coast. A reference indicates that at the time Jos. &amp;
        Mary Harper Campbell and their son Joseph left N. Ireland, they were
        leasing a home in Londonderry. Obviously Joseph didn't walk 36 miles to
        school. One possible explanation is that the story is correct, but our
        Campbells lived in two different locations: around 1800 near the
        Giant's Causeway, then moved to Londonderry before 1810.

        7. Those books are lost. Jos. C. Buck made an extensive, unsuccessful
        search for them among his mother's papers.

        The following account for 1827 may be of interest:<br>

        "&nbsp; - 10 ¾ lbs. of Mutton @ 43¢<br>
        <br>
        I was particularly interested in the items for whiskey which occurred
        with great regularity throughout the account.
      </p>
      <p>
        To refer back to the diary which starts in 1810, on the first two pages
        there is an account which starts as follows:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I sold my land to
        Al'D'R McSchain for 250<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guineas or
        <del>L</del>233-3S-9D."<sup>8</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are other entries showing that from the money received certain
        debts were paid.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following is the first four pages of the diary as nearly as I can
        decipher it. I have tried to retain the original spelling. Some of the
        words I have had to guess at. I do not know the month in which the
        diary starts, but I imagine that it was in the summer of 1810:

        From this point on the diary as such seems to stop. The book contains a
        description of the land, crops and game at the new home, which I
        imagine is our old farm, as one of the the original deeds for the place
        which I have in my possession is dated 1815; and I have another paper
        dated 1810 which refers to the contract to buy. The diary then takes on
        the nature of a letter for Joseph Campbell's brothers and sisters who
        were still in northern Ireland or some other place in the United
        States<sup>11</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been very much interested in going over these old papers and I
        am giving these extracts from the papers in the hope that they will
        likewise be of interest to the rest of the family. In some future
        letter I shall try to decipher more of this diary and pass it on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope other members of the family can find old papers and letters
        which would be of general interest and, if so, wouldn't it be a good
        idea to include those in our Correspondence Book?<sup>12</sup>

        9. Presumably "acloreara" was near Stroudsburg, PA. As for the sawmill,
        according to <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I661">
        Lucy DUNHAM</a> Hazlett, when the Hazletts arived in Beecher's Island
        (later Nelson) the only signs of it they found was a rusty saw blade.

        10. It's curious that he didn't mention that two of Elizabeth's older
        siblings, John Campbell and Mary CAMPBELL Hazlett remained in Lancaster
        Co., PA, where they had lived for several years. Elizabeth lived with
        Mary for a few years, then came to Beecher's Island.
      </p>
      <p>
        11. No trace of his siblings has ever shown up Joe only suggest 2
        places they might have lived, but they might have been Scotland --- or
        most any place Scots settled.
      </p>
      <p>
        12. This suggestion bore fruit in Vol. 4.
