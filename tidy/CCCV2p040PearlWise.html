        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        While in Elmira <span class="Annotation">[NY]</span> this fall, I enjoyed reading your letters so much, and thought at the time I would send one in too, but neglected it, so when <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a>'s letter came asking me to contribute this time, I was glad to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        As most of you know, on August 21, 1923, I married <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I951">Frederick H. Wise</a>, a successful chiropractor of Auburn, N. Y., and September first, we moved here to out present home. We have one son, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1549">Henry Mowrey Wise</a>, ten years old, who is very much delighted with his new "Daddy."<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        We have had a very pleasant winter and made many new friends. It was fortunate for me that my husband has been located here eight years. Auburn is in the heart of the Finger Lakes region, so I am sure some of you will be motoring this way this summer. Please be sure to look us up.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the other members of the family are writing for themselves. I am sure it will be easier for us to all write one letter a year instead of two<sup>2</sup>. Next time, I will have some pictures too.
      </p>
      <p>
        With best wishes to all, I am

    <div class="Footnote">
      <br>
      1. Pearl married her deceased husband's brother, so Frederick previously was Henry's uncle.<br>
      <br>
      2. Initially, Will Selph proposed 4 letters per year, but the Cousins would only agree to two per year --- which was done for 1923. But from then on, they decided one per year was enough.<br>
