        Dear Campbell Cousins:-

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        My letter has been delayed, largely because of the arrival on March
        20th, of Miss <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1527">
        Marian Loring Young</a>. She joins her brothers, <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1509">
        Philip</a> and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1515">
        John</a>, in sending greetings to her cousins of the third, fourth, and
        fifth generations<sup>1</sup>. Her <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1506">
        mother</a>'s <a href="CCCV4p039KatherineYoung.html">letter</a> tells
        you more about Miss Marian.

        I am now in the midst of preparations for the usual business trip to
        Europe and expect to sail on the Leviathan from New York on April 10th.
        Fortunately this year one of the boys from the store is going with me
        and I expect to have good company all the way, thereby removing one of
        the objectionable features of such a trip, namely, loneliness. We are
        going directly to London and from there will reach in turn, Paris,
        Berlin, Chemnitz, Dresden, Vienna and Paris again, whence we sail for
        home about the middle of May. With an itinerary like this, the trip is
        as enjoyable as though I were going as a tourist<sup>2</sup>. The
        amount of time spent buying and looking at merchandise is necessarily
        so small in comparison with the amount of time spent traveling that it
        is really more of a pleasure diversion than it is work.

        While in Elmira the first of March, at the time of my <a href=
        "YoungPhilip1866.html">father</a>'s death, I saw a good many of the
        Cousins, including <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1477">
        Carrie Campbell</a>, <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1482">
        Will Campbell</a> and his wife, <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1483">
        Winifred</a>, <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1559">
        Ruth Buck</a> Mandeville an her husband, <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1560">
        Bill Mandeville</a>, <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1551">
        Joe Buck</a>, and Cousin <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1544">
        Grace Carey</a>. Their sympathy and help did much to relieve the sorrow
        we felt. Cousin Will Campbell said truly that the Campbells as a rule
        see very little of each other but at times of sorrow they may be
        counted on to appear and offer real help.

        I have already warned you that I am a radio fan. We were late in
        catching the fever at my house and I have had a set only a little over
        a month. I have already worn out my near-by friends and neighbors with
        my radio yarns and turn gladly to you who have no way of stopping me.
        Like all beginners I went after distance with only moderate success.
        Some Chicago stations and Jacksonville, Fla. seem to constitute my
        limit, but I am consoled by the statement of older radio "experts" that
        conditions have been very bad around here this winter and that I will
        do better later on. With four Boston and three Providence stations
        broadcasting every night we can always get some variety and our
        greatest problem is to tune out local stations that monopolize the

        air<sup>3</sup>. I recently changed all of my tubes for new ones and
        about trebled the efficiency of my set. Just to show that the Campbells
        get in everywhere, let me record that Cousin <a href=

        Harry Campbell</a> sang from WLSI, Providence, about a month ago, and

        Edward Young</a>, broadcasted from Newark, N.J. over two years ago, so
        you may pick a Campbell on the air most anytime. This is a warning.

        3. In those early days of radio, programs were mostly music, with few
        commercials. Because the number of radio stations was fairly small, the
        pioneering stations were allowed to broadcast much stronger
        signals&nbsp; The chance of picking up distant stations was much better
        in the evening, because of "<a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave">skip</a>" --- except at times of
        higher solar activity such as sun spots.

        4. It's always seemed strange to me that the CCC letters frequently
        mention the Cousins Dinners; but rarely mention the Campbell Reunions.
        The Cousins Dinners were only for the grandchildren of Joseph and Ann
        Clinch Campbell --- and for their invited guests. The Campbell Reunions
        were open to the public and were attended by Luggs, Blackwells, and
        friends --- not just Campbells (including Hazletts).
