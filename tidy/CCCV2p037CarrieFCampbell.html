        Dear Cousins:

      <p>
        As I review the past months since I last wrote you there seems nothing of much interest to tell you about. Undoubtedly many of you know I have disposed of our former home here and am now occupying a four-room, heated apartment. Certainly this is a great change, but I rather enjoy it. One pleasant feature is that I am not more than fifteen minutes walk from my son <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1482">William</a>'s home, and only a block our of his way to business. As I have continued my work at the office, it makes it very nice for me as he comes for me in the morning and we return together at night.
