      <p>
        My dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        To be able to write a Round Robin to so many of my kin is really a
        treat for me, and the volume of letters is of great interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I am one of the few Western Cousins, I presume I should come
        through with a wild and wooly addition to the Campbell letters and
        perhaps even wax poetic over the great open spaces, et cetera.
        Unfortunately, I have long since discarded spurs and chaps, so can
        offer you nothing of the romance of our famed Golden West.
      </p>
      <p>
        If our strenuous April showers permit, <a href=
        "CampbellWilliam1864.html">Dad</a> and I will go into intensive
        training, shortly, for the family golf trophy must be wrestled from my
        brother <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I916">
        Bill</a> as soon as he returns from school<sup>1</sup>. Though he has
        been a long time "too busy," Dad has finally joined his two sons and
        has become quite a golf bug.
      </p>
      <p>
        If my plans materialize, Dad and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I905">
        Mother</a> will motor East in June to bring the brother home from
        school and I'm sure they will renew acquaintances in as many localities
        as their time will permit. You see, I am still very much unattached and
        will have ample time to direct the Campbell interests during their
        leave of absence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dad came closer to calling on <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Uncle
        Tommie</a> in St. Petersburg this winter than any previous year, so I
        really believe his motor jaunt will go through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anxiously awaiting the next edition of "The Campbell Cousins Conduct,"
        I am,
