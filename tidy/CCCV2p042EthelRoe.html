        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Having had the privilege of reading the letters of you all, I have felt very much ashamed ever since I let the opportunity pass by to contribute my share to this splendid means of renewing friendships and making new ones among the Cousins of my dear <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1493">Mother</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel as if I know you all, although many of you I have never seen, and I will say that I think the Campbells keep in touch with each other more closely than any family I have ever heard of. Congratulations!
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever since I have been married, we have lived just outside the city limits in a very pretty district Our family consists of only my husband, known by every one as <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1502">Jay</a>, his name being John, our little girl, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1503">Helen Jane</a>, and myself. Helen was eight on January the 12th, -- that is the date of my grandfather, <a href="CampbellJohn1836.html">John H. Campbell</a>'s birth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jay is engaged in the manufacturing business, distilling water and making soft drinks. I want to tell you right here that he, too, thoroughly enjoyed your letters.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;Helen Jane has kept things stirring in this home ever since she came to bless it. There are not any dull times except perhaps when she is asleep. This fact I have been very thankful for due to the untimely passing of my mother.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        We spend the greater part of our summers at Lake Keuka and Ontario, all being great lovers of water. Helen swam and did all sorts of stunts in the water when she was six<sup>1</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am told many, many times that I look just like my Mother and I regret that the suggestion of a group picture came too late to have one for this installment. Perhaps next time we will have one and you may judge for yourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        With love and best wishes to you all,
      </p>

      1. I haven't talked with Helen for quite a while, but from what I hear, as of this date (Feb, 6, 2013), she still enjoys summering on water - wbt,.
