        Dear Cousins:-

        Old Father Time is ever ready to remind us of things we are apt to
        neglect, -- and the Correspondence must not be neglected, as it seems
        to me like a continued story. I am looking forward to a lot of new
        correspondence this ear, - the more the merrier. Writing a letter is s
        small a thing to do in comparison with what we receive in return.

        We have been very much at home the past winter nursing a dislocated
        shoulder which <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1608">
        Alta</a> received on October 30th, while riding with a man, who lost
        control of his car and tipped over; but it is slowly coming back to
        normal we hope. However, he has invented and had patented a
        non-skidding auto-chain; our rural mail-carrier is using a pair now.
        The roads are in a very icy condition and he is making the entier trip,
        whereas before, he was not able to do so and had to have help in some
        places. Alta wants t keep us all from skidding. Cousin <a href=
        "EllisonHugh1888.html">Hugh Ellison</a> tried them our too and he tells
        the same story.<br>

        wife</a> and daughters and ourselves were privileged again last summer
        to take our vacation in the beautiful Adirondacks. We certainly enjoyed
        the trip and drives while there; we were near a farmer from whom we
        could buy fresh milk, butter, vegetables, and strawberries, and with
        our fish and what we took with us we fared sumptuously. The only
        trouble with vacations is that they are too short, although ours
        included the month of June. We enjoyed the woods and birds, -
        especially the Whip-poor-wills, who visited us every evening. We
        visited a deer lick, -- something I had always heard Uncle
        George<sup>1</sup> speak of, as he enjoyed hunting. Sometime I would
        like to go to the highest peak,- Mount Marcy.

        We received Christmas Greetings from nearly all of the Cousins; was
        glad to be remembered.
      </p>
      <p>
        With best wishes to all,

        1. I'm not sure who "Uncle George" referred to. The first candidate
        that comes to mind is <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1295">
        George Tubbs</a>. Presumably the deer lick she was referring to was a
        naturally occurring salt deposit.
