        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Again we are to hear from each other and to feel that we are not so widely separated. It will indeed be a pleasure to us to receive the package of letters from home, and I am sure the most important work at that time will be the reading of them. Perhaps we will hear from some who have not written before. Every new member adds to the interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have glorious news, Cousin <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel</a> has written to us that she and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I773">Llewellyn</a> are coming for a visit, -- in fact they will spend their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary with us, the 12th of July. What a wonderful trip they will have motoring from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast, and what a joy in store for us!
      </p>
      <p>
        We wish more of the Cousins would plan such a holiday. Better have the Cousins' Dinner here, July 12th.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have been unusually well during the winter, always looking forward to <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I820">Faith</a>'s<sup>1</sup> occasional visits home. She brought one of her room mates for the spring vacation and we had a happy time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Will close now with best wishes to all.
      </p>
