        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        When March first arrived I said "For once I'll be on time with my
        "cousin letter", but regardless of several previous reminders, I'm just
        writing it now.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Today is <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1596">
        Ann Taylor</a>'s birthday. She is eight years old and considers herself
        quite a young lady. We are to entertain tonight, as no birthday is
        complete without a party.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have had a busy and enjoyable winter. Some of the special events for
        me have been trips once a month to Bailey Hall, Ithaca, where we heard
        fine concerts given by the Boston Symphony Orchestra; Moriz Rosenthal,
        pianist; Cleveland Symphony Orchestra; Emilio de Gogorza, baritone; and
        Efram Zimbalist, violinist. I also had the pleasure of hearing
        Geraldine Farrar in Carmen.
      </p>
      <p>
        In October we drove to Nelson with Miss McKay, a kindergarten teacher,
        and had dinner with <a href="LoopStella1863.html">Mama</a>. Then we
        went to Mansfield and called on Aunt <a href=
        "CampbellMary1851.html">Mary Shipman</a> and family, and inspected the
        Normal<sup>1</sup>. In December we drove to Watkins to see Cousins
        <a href="CongdonEmma1848.html">Em Buck</a> and <a href=
        "CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a> and <a href="VaughanEmma1854.html">Em
        Congdon</a>. Needless to say, we enjoyed the calls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christmas Day we spent with <a href="HookerEva1885.html">Eva</a>. All
        that was lacking to make it a perfect day was Mama. But we are hoping
        we'll be together next Christmas.
      </p>
      <p>
        All these things together with church, clubs and Eastern Star work (I'm
        secretary of our Chapter) have kept me busy.

        Jack Sr.</a> is president of the Parent-Teacher Association. The
        Association is responsible for the organizing of a Boys Band of
        sixty-five pieces, and it has also raised twenty-eight hundred
        dollars<sup>2</sup> to equip a playground. These accomplishments,
        together with a new community house which is being built by our church,
        make us feel the Heights is active.

        Mother Hazlett</a> home from Florida soon. They have been gone since
        last November. Dad bought a lot and built a bungalow, so I suppose
        that's where we'll find them winters now, as according to the letters
        Florida agrees with them.

        1. Treva and my mother were both Mansfield Normal School grads, class
        of 1913. I think Treva stopped teaching when she married.

        2. A lot of money back then.

        I went to Nelson in February for Mama's birthday. The children thought
        it a treat to ride on the Nelson train, but to me it goes slower each
        year, and I was glad Jack could drive up<sup>3</sup> for us.

        In looking over the letters of a year ago, I find that <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1505">
        Cousin Roswell</a> mentioned seeing "Blossom Time" in London. We saw it
        at the Lyceum in January, the night of our severe snow storm. We
        couldn't drive the car, and it took over an hour to go by trolley, but
        we arrived on time and enjoyed the play. We found afterward that the
        trolley stopped at nine o'clock that evening because of drifts! We met
        a young man from the Heights who was also attempting to get home, and,
        because we had left our children with young girls, said he would take
        Mrs. Owen and me home. For about two hours we sat along the road - when
        we were not shovelling snow <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>.
        Finally we arrived within two blocks, so we waded that far and reached
        home about one o'clock the next morning! Mr. Owen and Jack got a taxi
        and managed to arrive at about two o'clock. I don't think we shall
        forget "Blossom Time", soon, anyway. Uncle <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1577">
        Ross Loop</a> drove over and had to be shovelled <span class=
        "Annotation">[sic]</span> out.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a rather long letter for me, and as it is nearing party time,
        as Anne keeps reminding me, so I shall now close.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope that we shall see a good many out at the reunions this year.
        Plan to take your vacation for this year, and we'd like to make it a
        success.
