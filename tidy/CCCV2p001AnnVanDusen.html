        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        So much has happened since I received your letters last fall that I hardly know what to write.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are having severe March weather after so mild a winter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am quite well again and am staying in my own home.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have a fine Presbyterian minister here now and I get out to church every Sunday.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish all of my Cousins could come and see me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have twenty maple trees on my lot. My grandboy<sup>1</sup> and I are going to make sugar and if you were all here, I surely would treat you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think we ought to congratulate <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will</a>, also ourselves, for our willing helpers who are going to continue our Correspondence Club. I enjoy the letters very much. Four of the first cousins live in Osceola. In Nelson, the old home town, very few of the cousins are left.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our next Campbell Re-union and Cousins Dinner are coming before our next Letters and I hope to be able to attend both gatherings this year and meet as many of you as can possibly attend.<br>
