        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        It seems so short a time since we wrote our Cousins letters in 1925 that I hardly know what to write, so many things have happened all around us. In our home town there have been a number of deaths and at present many are sick.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yesterday at the Bulkley farm, above town, a man was crossing the river with a load of milk -- the water was high and man and team were drowned; the man has not been found yet today; the team and wagon were carried nearly a mile down stream.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I went to Wellsboro a few days ago to see sister <a href="SeelyAda1858.html">Ada Crandall</a>, who is with her son, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I453">Mahlon</a>, this winter; she went there last December and has not been able to go out on the street since; has been under the doctor's care most of the time; gains very slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I660">Mary</a> and I are well as usual and able to eat our rations and this reminds me that it is dinner time and I will have to get my own dinner for Mary has gone out to a tureen dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        All these things remind me that while we are in life, we are in the midst of death. "Be ye also ready, etc."
      </p>
      <p>
        With love and best wishes to you all,
      </p>
