        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        When Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a>, on October
        20th, at the Cousins Dinner (which by the way, was a most enjoyable
        affair), so kindly explained the necessity of of having the letters
        sent early, and how much easier it mad it for those who have the work o
        putting them together, I fully resolved that I would send mine on time,
        but - well I failed again, and Cousin <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1505">
        Roswell</a>'s letter came as a reminder.
      </p>
      <p>
        The winter has passed as usual, - plenty of work to keep us out of
        mischief, but no rush. Sometimes, when the thermometer registered
        several degrees below zero, the wind blowing a gale, snow a foot deep,
        and drifting, - perhaps we <u>did</u> feel a little envious of our more
        fortunate Cousins basking in the sunshine of the Sunny South, but we
        must do our part to keep Nelson (the birthplace of most of our Cousins
        and ancestor), on the map.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        We were shocked and saddened to hear of the death of Cousin <a href=
        "YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil Young</a>. I had transacted business with
        him for several years and always found him a man of sterling qualities,
        pleasant and genial personalities. So it is, year by year, some drop
        out and occasionally some are added to our number.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were glad to welcome Cousin <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1051">
        Albert Snavely</a>, who so kindly came all the way from Washington,
        D.C., with family to spend the day with us at the Cousins Dinner.
        <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1605">
        Cousin Doris</a>, also added one to the clan, and we hope to meet him
        at some future time.
      </p>
      <p>
        My sister, <a href="SeelyAda1858.html">Ada Crandall</a>, has been quite
        sick all winter had has been with in Wellsboro, Pa., with <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I453">
        Mahlon</a>, her son, and we have missed her usual visits, but am glad
        to say that at last account she was better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks giving day we spent with brother <a href=
        "SeelyJud1851.html">Jud</a> and family at Osceola, and had a very
        pleasant time, talking over old times and bringing to mind many things
        almost forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have not heard whether Cousin <a href=
        "CampbellKate1853.html">Kate</a> and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I787">
        Lish Horton</a> have returned from the West, -- called there by the
        serious illness of their daughter <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I815">
        Nellie</a> but feel sure we will hear from them in the Cousins Book;
        also from <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a> and <a href=
        "CongdonEmma1848.html">Em</a> and <a href=
        "CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie</a> and all the rest, too numerous to
        mention.
      </p>
      <p>
        With love to all and best wishes to all, I am
