        Yours of June 1st is at hand. I received the book and acknowledge same. Say, you do not know how I appreciate your kindness in making it possible for me to have one of those books. <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">C. H. Congdon</a> sent one to <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1708">Em</a> and me to read, -- the first issue -- and we returned it. I appreciate <a href="SeelyJud1851.html">Jud Seely</a>'s thoughtfulness in giving my name as one to receive the Cousins Book of letters. But this time my wife was not present<sup>1</sup> with me to talk about the different composers of those letters, which keeps the chain of relationship together.&nbsp;<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I cannot comprehend the effort you have give to complete such a book. I take pride in showing it to some people who are capable of realizing the effort such an undertaking requires.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope you and your wife can make me a visit. My sister-in-law is keeping the house open and making it possible for me to have a home.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent three months last winter in Florida and California, but was glad to come back to my own home.
