      <p>
        After the appointment of the several committees, an address was given
        by the Rev. Mr. Armstrong who dwelt for some time upon the redeeming
        qualities of the Scotch as a people our forefathers being of Scotch
        descent. He also referred to the active work of them in connection with
        the early history of the Presbyterian Church of Nelson.
      </p>
      <p>
        His remarks <span style="text-decoration: underline;">were
        followed</span> by some very fitting remarks by the Rev. Mr. Miller.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. E.B. Campbell was then called upon for reminiscences. He gave a
        very interesting account of the Journeyings of our Forefathers from the
        time they left the old Country, following them to Belfast where they
        engaged in work at the Belfast Iron Works, then coming a little farther
        on making the next stop at Jersey Shore, then following the Williamson
        road to the Chemung River and finally cast anchor at a place known as
        Thorn Bottom<sup>1</sup> at the junction where it joins the Cowanesque
        river. in a perfect wilderness filled with all sorts of howling beasts.
        Here the first tree was fell the first land was cleared, the first hill
        of corn was sown and the first wheat was raised by our forefathers.
        Then Came the long Journey on foot, through the dense wilderness, with
        the Bag of corn on his back. Miles away, to get it ground into meal for
        food for the family, cutting notches on trees as he went along, to mark
        the path he must follow on his return, that would bring him safely
        home, and later, when the river was frozen and these trips, fraught
        with danger would be made on the Ice. Not having friction matches in
        those days, much difficulty was experienced in building fires, often
        being obliged to go some distance to a neighbors in the morning before
        breakfast after a Fire Brand to start a fire to get the morning's meal
        with. The nearest store was at Lawrenceville. There was no money in
        circulation and produce was the principal thing used as a circulatory
        mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James Campbell</a> at one time got
        into debt at this store in the Sum of $12 and was arrested and going to
        be imprisoned, which seems to have practiced in those days. But by
        going the length of the river he was able to raise the amount, by
        borrowing 50 cts here &amp; $1 there. Thus saving his being imprisoned.
        This the Speaker said was the nearest he knew of any of the family ever
        being imprisoned.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next Speaker was J.H. Campbell. He told us a story of much
        interest, about the voyage to this country of those who came here
        first. It seems that a storm came across the Vessel, in mid ocean which
        broke off the mast of the ship's, which fell killing the ships mate.
        Then speaking of the strict religious character of our ancestors, told
        how an Saturday P.M. they turn the Sap troughs bottom side up, for over
        Sunday, letting the sap fall upon the ground. Thus strictly adhering to
        Bible doctrine, and regarding the Sabbath as a day of rest. While the
        Sons of this generation were Christian Men, and observed the Sabbath,
        they thought it equally as much a sin to see the Sap run to waste on
        Sunday, as it was to catch it. So one Sunday night the slipped back and
        turned the troughs right-side up and caught the sap on Sunday that
        would otherwise have gone to waste, they boiled this down into sugar
        and traded the sugar for a log chain, this chain however was never used
        by the Father and his religious scruples were such that he would not
        eat a meal of victuals that was cooked over a fire that was made of the
        wood drawn by this chain. He then Spoke of some of the pranks of wild
        beasts so numerous in those days, one about a Bear that came and caught
        a Hog that weighed over 100 lbs and ran away with it. the peculiar of
        this story was that they hadn't seen the Hog since.
      </p>
      <p>
        He then spoke of that branch of the family living near Pittsburgh &amp;
        Allegheny City, of which but little is known by the present generation
        living in this vicinity.<sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The next speaker was <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I95">
        Robert Campbell</a> who spoke about his childhood among the wolves.
        then came a barefoot story about garding <span class=
        "Annotation">[sic]</span> the Sheep for protection from the wolves at
        night.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next speaker was Mrs. Jane Tubbs about a sect called the mill
        wrights. that had set a day on which the world was going to burn up.
        This created a great tumult in her childish mind but her confidence was
        reassured when her father. in whom She had explicit faith. told her not
        to fear. that God would care for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next speakers at this meeting. only made short remarks. and they
        spoke in the following order.<br>
        J M Loop<sup>3</sup> --- <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil
        Young</a><br>
        <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1476">
        A E Campbell</a> - <a href="CongdonEmma1848.html">Emma Buck</a><br>
        <a href="CampbellEleanor1828.html">Elenor <span class=
        "Annotation">[sic]</span> Bosard</a> - Jane Tubbs.
      </p>
      <p>
        E. B. Campbell and Jane Tubbs were appointed as a committee to prepare
        a Genealogy and reminiscences of our ancestors to be presented for
        reading at the next annual gathering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rev. Mr. Miller then desired to add a few remarks. in which he
        announced a Union Sunday School Picnic to be held on the same grounds
        we were occupying Two weeks from that date.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then a vote of thanks was given to the clergy for their presence &amp;
        remarks. and to Mrs. G.H. Baxter for kindness in permitting us to use
        the grounds for the Picnic. The secretary then reported 21 present
        bearing the name of Campbell - 9 males and 12 Female. There were 108
        Relatives present and 4 visitors present. Total took dinner at the
        Picnic 112.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the close of secretary's report, Prayer was offered by the Rev Mr
        Armstrong. This virtually ended the program for the day. Though the
        younger ones lingered for some time engaged in exchanging friendly
        greetings, playing Croquet and other various sports.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> five sisters, Daughters
        of Joseph Campbell present - whose ages run as follows<br>
        <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Jane Tubbs</a> 59<br>

        The agregate <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> Ages of these five
        sisters is 315 years. I doubt very much if any family living can show a
        like record.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were 12 children in the Joseph Campbell family, 33 Grand
        children, and 49 Great-grand children making a total of 94 in the three
        generations from the one Family.
      </p>

        members of the Two Families in three generations.

        The above Statistics were handed me by Phoebe Hoyt to be recorded with
        the report of this meeting.
