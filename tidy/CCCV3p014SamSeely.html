        Dear Cousins:

      <p>
        Another year has passed and I have been reminded that the time for another exchange of letters is approaching - a pleasure to which we are all looking forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a wonderful day for this time of year. It see,ms good after such a severe winter. The dirt roads are in fine shape, and land will soon be dry enough to work if the good weather continues. In fact, some farmers have already been plowing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general cleaning up, repairing of fences and numerous other chores, keeps a farmer always on the job at this season of the year.

        We attended the Campbell reunion<sup>2</sup> at Nelson this last year, and, I am sorry to say, there were only about sixty members present. I can remember when there used to be twice that number. But as each year passes, it is bound to bring its joys and sorrows to all of us. Hope to see more of the cousins there this year, and renew our acquaintance.

        These spring days begin to make us think about summer and what we shall do when the weather is warm and we can get out to enjoy it. Usually we plan on a trip to Pennsylvania, but this year I am trying to get my people to come here instead. They haven't said that they will come, but I am making my plans for them just the same, for I think they will come if they can. There are lots of lovely things to do here in warm weather, and I hope they decide to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can say for my family that we are all well and looking forward to the letter, including those from the new members of the C.C.C.

        2. Strange as it seems, CCC letter seldom mentinn the Campbell reunions. [The latter were held in the summer.] At their peak, in the early 1900s more than 300 sometimes attended. For some, that was too big. So, the grandchildren of Joseph and Ann Clinch Campbell formed the smaller, and more selective Cousins Dinners [which were held in the fall and were by invitation only].
