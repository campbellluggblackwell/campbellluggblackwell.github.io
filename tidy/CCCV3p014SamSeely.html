        Dear Cousins:

      <p>
        Another year has passed and I have been reminded that the time for
        another exchange of letters is approaching - a pleasure to which we are
        all looking forward.
      </p>

        This is a wonderful day for this time of year. It see,ms good after
        such a severe winter. The dirt roads are in fine shape, and land will
        soon be dry enough to work if the good weather continues. In fact, some
        farmers have already been plowing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general cleaning up, repairing of fences and numerous other chores,
        keeps a farmer always on the job at this season of the year.

        We attended the Campbell reunion<sup>2</sup> at Nelson this last year,
        and, I am sorry to say, there were only about sixty members present. I
        can remember when there used to be twice that number. But as each year
        passes, it is bound to bring its joys and sorrows to all of us. Hope to
        see more of the cousins there this year, and renew our acquaintance.

        These spring days begin to make us think about summer and what we shall
        do when the weather is warm and we can get out to enjoy it. Usually we
        plan on a trip to Pennsylvania, but this year I am trying to get my
        people to come here instead. They haven't said that they will come, but
        I am making my plans for them just the same, for I think they will come
        if they can. There are lots of lovely things to do here in warm
        weather, and I hope they decide to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can say for my family that we are all well and looking forward to the
        letter, including those from the new members of the C.C.C.

        2. Strange as it seems, CCC letter seldom mentinn the Campbell
        reunions. [The latter were held in the summer.] At their peak, in the
        early 1900s more than 300 sometimes attended. For some, that was too
        big. So, the grandchildren of Joseph and Ann Clinch Campbell formed the
        smaller, and more selective Cousins Dinners [which were held in the
        fall and were by invitation only].
