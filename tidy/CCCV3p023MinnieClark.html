        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        We are again called upon to exchange letters. I hope that this year we shall receive one from each of the cousins. Some of them have gone from our midst by reason of death. We can't get over <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1448">Ross</a>'s death. He was such a useful man. He is very much missed by the company.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SeelyAda1858.html">Cousin Ada</a> had a bad loss by fire. She is now living in the Seely house next door to me. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I456">Mrs. Seely</a> died very suddenly, after being sick only one hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today we are having March winds, all right, and snow and rain. Well, I guess we shall have spring sometime.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="TubbsAnn1855.html">Anne</a> was just in and reminded me about my letter, saying that it should reach New York by the first of April. I am so glad to receive the letters. I can't wait to get and read them all. They come from so many different states and cities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I cannot think of very much to write. I stay at home most of the time during the winter, but I have been to Nelson once this winter. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1608">Alta Cady</a> comes in quite often.<sup>1</sup> I have not been up on the farm since New Year's Day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I see in the Nelson items that <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Ann Owlett</a> is home. I was glad she visited New York <span class="Annotation">[City]</span>. I heard part of President Coolidge's fine inaugural address over the radio<sup>2</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1470">Will</a> still works at carpenter work<sup>3</sup> and likes it very much.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I guess that I have written enough for this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Love to all the cousins,
