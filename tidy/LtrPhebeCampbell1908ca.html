    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. We don't know to whom this letter was written, but it appears to
        have been to one of her nephews or nieces (or perhaps to their spouse
        or child). Because she refers to several of her siblings as 'uncle' or
        'aunt' we can rule out their children or grandchildren. And those who
        died before 1907/8. Some possibilities might be Mary CAMPBELL Shipman,
        Kate CAMPBELL Horton, Tommie Campbell, Wm. Clayton Campbell, Emma
        CONGDON Buck, Ed Congdon, Charlie Congdon, Jennie CRANE Bosard, Laura
        BOSARD Mourey, Ann BOSARD Owlett, Herb Hughey, Stella LOOP Hooker
        Wilbur, Will Selph or Jennie SELPH Cady. The latter seems unlikely
        because she lived in Nelson.
      </p>

        The existing letter is a single sheet of paper, both sides filled. It
        is possible that instead of being the entire letter the surviving sheet
        is merely the last sheet of a longer letter.

        Isabelle Hoyt</a>.

        3. "Frank" may have been <a href="GoodrichFrances1871.html">Frances
        GOODRICH</a> Hoyt.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. "Charlie" may have been "Professor" <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1636">
        Charles Blackwell Campbell</a>. He was a musician and music teacher.
        But I don't know Frances Hoyt would have been able to help him with his
        sheet music --- if that's what the "charts" were.
