        1. We don't know to whom this letter was written, but it appears to have been to one of her nephews or nieces (or perhaps to their spouse or child). Because she refers to several of her siblings as 'uncle' or 'aunt' we can rule out their children or grandchildren. And those who died before 1907/8. Some possibilities might be Mary CAMPBELL Shipman, Kate CAMPBELL Horton, Tommie Campbell, Wm. Clayton Campbell, Emma CONGDON Buck, Ed Congdon, Charlie Congdon, Jennie CRANE Bosard, Laura BOSARD Mourey, Ann BOSARD Owlett, Herb Hughey, Stella LOOP Hooker Wilbur, Will Selph or Jennie SELPH Cady. The latter seems unlikely because she lived in Nelson.

      <p>
        The existing letter is a single sheet of paper, both sides filled. It is possible that instead of being the entire letter the surviving sheet is merely the last sheet of a longer letter.

        2. Phebe's granddaughters, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1250">Jessica</a>, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1276">Elizabeth</a> &amp; <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1285">Isabelle Hoyt</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. "Frank" may have been <a href="GoodrichFrances1871.html">Frances GOODRICH</a> Hoyt.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. "Charlie" may have been "Professor" <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1636">Charles Blackwell Campbell</a>. He was a musician and music teacher. But I don't know Frances Hoyt would have been able to help him with his sheet music --- if that's what the "charts" were.
