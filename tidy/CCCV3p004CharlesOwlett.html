        Dear Campbell Cousins:
      </p>

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Well, as you have urged me to write, I'll try and say a few words.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a nice fat boy to add to your list of cousins. His name is <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1158">Charles Butler Owlett</a>. He was eight months old the twentieth of this month. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1157">Marth <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> Ann</a> was four years old the tenth of February, but she doesn't walk yet<sup>1</sup>. However, she is gaining every day now, and we are hoping that she can walk before long.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have just attended church. Mr. Alty preached a wonderful sermon on the works of the Holy Ghost in the lives of men. I have been a little unfortunate this winter. Was out of work about three months, but business is picking up some now.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were all glad to see <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Mother Owlett</a> back home with us again after her Washington trip.
      </p>
      <p>
        Best wishes to all the cousins,
      </p>

        1. Reportedly Martha had polio plus some developmental problems and was cared for all her life by her very dedicated mother.
