          Dear Cousins and Sisters:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Message">
        <p>
          In our good book of letters there are so many very interesting ones which we have read and reread, that it seems hardly worth while for me to make the attempt. However, I must do my duty as far as I can. Perhaps just a short sketch of my first experience with the Campbell family, may bring to the memory of some of the older Cousins other events of interest.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the year 1869 circumstances were such that I went for a time to live with my sister, Mrs. Susan Deland, to assist her with millinery and dress-making. Her home was at Nelson, Pa., which was at that time a thriving little town.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a business way, I soon became acquainted with the people there, and in the surrounding country, They often came to the Island (as many of them still called it)<sup>1</sup> to exchange their products for the supplies they needed. I frequently heard the name Campbell mentioned. I said, "How many Campbells are there here?" I was told that they comprised many of the substantial families of Nelson and vicinity, little thinking at that time I would ever become so closely interwoven with the good people bearing that name. However, fortune seemed to favor me, and in a little less than three years, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1048">John</a> and I were married at my Nelson home, by Rev. S. A. Rawson, whom many of you will remember.
        </p>
        <p>
          We began housekeeping in Nelson, when <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1050">Mary</a> was ten weeks old. For a time we were near neighbors to <a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">Mark</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I973">Sue Seely</a>, also <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a> and <a href="VaughanEmma1854.html">Emma Congdon</a>. We were surely a very congenial lot. <a href="SeelyLena1873.html">Lena Seely</a>, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I941">Georgia Congdon</a> and Mary were nearly an age so there was always something for entertainment. Sad indeed were the days when we had to be separated. <a href="SelphJennie1873.html">Jennie Selph</a> Cady and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1059">Elva Mourie</a> Seely with the three I have mentioned were born the same year, 1873.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember seeing <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Grandmother Campbell</a> often. One time in particular, I saw her at Aunt <a href="CampbellSarah1824.html">Sallie Congdon</a>'s where she had spent the day. She left her glasses, but soon returned for them, walking all the way back to her home on the old farm where she had lived so many years. At the time of her death, my sister went to assist in all that could be done as was the custom in those days. The picture of Grandmother, which you all have in your Correspondence Album, is a very good one as I remember her.

          With the exception of <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1043">Father Bosard</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I89">Uncle Thomas</a>, I have known all of that generation, their wives and husbands. I saw but little of <a href="CampbellJulia1845.html">Aunt Julia</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1600">her husband</a> as their home was in the west [Michigan - wbt].
        </p>
        <p>
          For several years we lived on the farm two miles from Nelson. <a href="CampbellEleanor1828.html">Mother Bosard</a> and <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Ann</a> were with us, --<a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1057">Laura</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1058">Charlie</a> having moved to the Buck Mowrie farm where they still reside. I then became better acquainted with the families. Mother never wearied of telling us of their experiences, the pleasures as well as the hardships of their early life, -- in fact all the way through. We frequently exchanged visits with the different families and those of you who remember, know the latch string<sup>2</sup> always hung outside and we received a cordial welcome as we walked in.
        </p>
        <p>
          We often visit Tioga County and are happy to meet so many of the Cousins in Nelson and the nearby towns, also the Uncle <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James Campbell</a> and Hazlett Cousins<sup>3</sup>, who are very near to us all. As I sat in the little church on the hill<sup>4</sup>, I picture the scene as it was in the long ago. How different now, their seats are vacant or occupied by other earnest workers, all with the same aim. We pass on to the cemetery which plainly tells the final story.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel that <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a> has, and is still performing a wonderful task. A blessing which we all appreciate and one which will be appreciated by the generation to follow. I wonder if he remembers stopping at our house in Lawrenceville [PA - wbt] as he journeyed back and forth from his Osceola home<sup>5</sup> to Mansfield where he attended school<sup>6</sup>. A strong determination to be a man among men has brought him where he is. I wish to express my pleasure in the confidence he has in my daughters by asking them to assist in this great work<sup>7</sup> and trust with the aid of a proficient <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">President</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1505">Vice-President</a> his work will be diminished.

        2. <u>Latch string is out</u> --- Pioneer's cabins in early PA had no doorknobs. On the inside of the door, was a piece of wood, several inches long, that pivoted. When it dropped into a holder fastened to the door frame, the door was "latched" shut and secure. A visitor had to knock or call out, to have the door opened for them. A string was tied to the latch, so if everyone was leaving the house, they pulled the string so that when the door closed, the string could be pulled up to open the door and get back in. The end of the latch string could be left out when people were at home --- as a signal to visitors to come on in.<br>

        6. Then named "Mansfield Normal School", later "Mansfield State Teachers College", now "Mansfield U." In pioneer days, neighbors would eventually decide a school was needed, meet together, pledge money, build a school, and hire someone who would work cheap as a teacher --- almost always someone who was single. At first, males; later usually a young woman. One of the parents usually provided room and board. As public education became more organized, states created "Normal Schools" to train teachers. When my mother graduated from Mansfield Normal School (1913), two years of study qualified you for certification as a primary school teacher; three years for certification as a secondary school teacher. State teachers colleges had a 4 year program, resulting in a B.S. in Education degree. For what Nelson's early schools were like, see Phebe CAMPBELL Hoyt's <a href="MemoirCampbellPhebe1832.html">memoirs</a>.<br>
