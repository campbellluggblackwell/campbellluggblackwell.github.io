        Dear <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a>:-

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I hope you will pardon our delay in acknowledging receipt of your
        letters and of the very good looking book for correspondence. They
        arrived when we were in the process of moving and we are just now
        getting back to normal living.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        This Correspondence Club idea is splendid and you certainly deserve a
        lot of credit for getting it up. In a very few days I am going to get
        off a letter to the Cousins. Hope you don't mind my writing it instead
        of <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I962">
        Bernice</a>; she is really too busy for any personal correspondence.
        She is very much a "business woman" and when she gets home at night she
        has to relax.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the pictures,-- it just happens we haven't any of the three of us
        <span class="Annotation">[Louise, Bernice, and their mother, who was
        living with them most of the time to assist a convalescing
        Louise-wbt]</span> together. Ever since your letters came we have
        intended to have some taken but Sundays are the only days we are
        together and the last two have been cloudy. However, we will make
        another attempt and maybe they will reach you in time.
      </p>
      <p>
        With kindest regards from us all to you and your family,<br>
      </p>
