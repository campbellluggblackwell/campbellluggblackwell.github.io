        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Am very sure that Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> has never been grandmother to three babies<sup>1</sup> with measles or he would not have asked me to write a letter even as important as the Cousins Correspondence letter.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        We have not only had measles but measles plus. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1266">Baby Henry</a> has had bronchitis and an abscess in both ears and a sixteen month old baby with all that trouble is considerable care. However, we hope they are all on the road to complete recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        As <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1285">Isabelle</a> has written the family letter since I have been here<sup>2</sup> you will have to pardon me if we tell the same story.
      </p>
      <p>
        Talked with <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1276">Betty</a> last evening. They have a dandy <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1282">baby boy</a> but think <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Walker-36164">Joseph</a> will always come first with his "Gram."<sup>3</sup> He has just had his half term examinations and passed all his subjects above ninety, which I think pretty good for an eight year old boy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Am afraid <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1256">Tom</a>, Jess' boy, will not be able to go back to school this year. He has a slight valvular heart trouble and measles have left him far from strong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Isabelle wrote yesterday from Atlantic City that she was enjoying her Easter vacation<sup>4</sup> very much She expects to visit Philadelphia and Harrisburg on her way home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anticipating much pleasure from the Cousins letters, I extend greetings to you all from <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/hoyt-211">Jessica</a> and myself.
