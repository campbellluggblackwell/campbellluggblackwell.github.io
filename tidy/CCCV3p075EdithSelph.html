        Dear Cousins-in-law:

      <p>
        After having delayed this letter as long as I possibly could in the hope that I might be excused this time, my inexorable <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">husband</a> still persists in his demand for an epistle,which will be, I fear, like some epilogues, somewhat superfluous. For with two other members of the family to tell the news<sup>1</sup> it is difficult to add much that will be interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as it has been suggested that we write of "everyday happenings" (and, after all, what else is there to write about?), William may have forgotten to tell you that we are trying to "keep a roof over our heads" just now; so if this letter of various remarks seems disconnected and betokens a wandering mind, please lay the blame on the broad shoulders of the carpenters.

        The other day a newspaper item telling of the blooming of the trees in Washington turned our thoughts backward a year and we were again in our Capitol City looking at the Lincoln Memorial and the Monument, standing in the midst of the beautiful pink blossoms, where we left you last year. After the visit to Washington I took another trip. First, I visited Springfield, Massachusetts, with friends and attended several sessions of the big conference of our church held every four years. All the bishops and prominent people are at this gathering, and the great Municipal Building was filled. While there I also visited a paper mill for the first time, and was much interested in the many processes employed in producing all kinds of paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I went to Wheaton College to visit <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1605">Doris</a> and to attend the Annual May Day Pageant. We have had no trips this spring, but I hope to visit Doris again next month, and am looking forward to this treat.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meantime our hands are being "kept out of mischief " by the usual "common round of tasks"--sewing and the inevitable attack of housecleaning which breaks out at this time of the year to keep us indoors when we would much rather go out and play.

        This year Doris' new experience<sup>2</sup> has kept our minds and hands a little busier than usual, and our hearts, too, as many of the cousins can realize as the young people grow up. We have enjoyed the cousins' visits. <a href="SelphJennie1873.html">Jennie</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1608">Alta</a>, <a href="LoopStella1863.html">Stella</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I846">Edna</a>, <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Anna Owlett</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1050">Mary Snavely</a>, and <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">George</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I927">Anna Buck</a> have been with us. We regret the illness that kept us from adding to the list Cousin <a href="CongdonEmma1848.html">Emma Buck</a> and Cousins <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a> and <a href="VaughanEmma1854.html">Emma Congdon</a> whom Doris and I have never met.

        Our town is growing and progressing: four churches are planning for larger buildings, the Women's Club is raising funds for a larger clubhouse, and with the new country club and with other interests which we have, it's a busy town. Our own church societies carry on a good work. William has served on the music committee and we hope that during the coming year a new quartette and new organ will give us very good music.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have been admiring the florist's windows at this season with their Easter displays of azaleas, hyacinths, daffodils, tulips and lillies <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>, and we are enjoying our own jonquil bed which after the winter's storm is filled with big, golden flowers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I shall leave you here. You will be ready by this time, to take a long breath before you turn to the next letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        With best wishes to one and all, I am,
