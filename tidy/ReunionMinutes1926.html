        The 34th Annual reunion of the Campbell Clan was held at Nelson Aug.
        19, 1926.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over 100 members availed themselves of this friendly fellowship.
      </p>
      <p>
        The committee in charge gave their best in making arrangements and
        carrying out the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        The committee on place of meeting secured the I.O.O.F. Hall and the
        refreshments committee was early on hand and spared no pains in
        arranging the dinner. The reception committee made each one feel the
        "at homeness" which makes a real reunion.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the first tablespoonsfull had satisfied the natural appetite with
        the bountiful dinner served by willing hands they were entertained by
        Prof. Dann and family and when all had been served to dinner the Pres.
        <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2516">
        C.H. Lugg</a> took the chair and called the social and business meeting
        to order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Chas. Congdon</a> let the Clan
        in singing "America the Beautiful" and "America" in his own masterful
        manner, with <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I9930">
        Mrs. James Parks</a> at the piano.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Rev. <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1641">
        Coral Butler</a> offered prayer Cousin <a href=
        "ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel Shaw</a> took charge of the program and
        in her able way made this hour of the day vie with the bountiful dinner
        in enjoyment and satisfaction to those present. She spoke of those of
        our number who have made for themselves names in the musical world as
        <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I695">
        E. L. Monroe</a>, <a href=

        Edward Young</a>, <a href=

        Harry Campbell</a> &amp; C. H. Congdon. But added we have musical
        ability in our younger cousins &amp; stated we were to be favored with
        music by some of them. She then called on <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1648">
        Gertrude</a> and <a href=

        Mary Butler</a> of the "<a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James
        Campbell</a> family" who then favored us with a piano duet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cousin Mabel said the committee had tried to have a representative from
        each branch of the Clan have a part on the program; so she asked C.H.
        Lugg to represent the "Lugg unit"<sup>1</sup> with a word of welcome -
        Altho it was the "Irishman's Surprise" to him he extended a hearty
        welcome.

        A clarinet solo by <a href=

        George Wilson</a> was so pleasing that he was encored &amp; cheerfully
        responded. <a href=

        Fannie Monroe</a> in behalf of the "Hazlett family",<sup>2</sup> gave a
        reading, for the benefit of our cousins from the Sunny South she said,
        entitled "A Colored Wedding".<sup>3</sup>

        Francis Hall</a> of the "Merritt family"<sup>4</sup> was encored &amp;
        our little cousin responded very readily to the pleasure of his
        audience.

        <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Mrs. E. S. Horton</a> of the "Joseph
        Campbell family" gave an interesting paper containing facts gathered
        from previous Reunion minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        When <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Cousin Tommie</a> was called on
        for remarks he told us he is so full of Florida with its sunshine and
        flowers he can not talk without speaking of it &amp; he is sure the
        birds sing sweeter, the flowers are more fragrant &amp; and the moon is
        bigger in St. Petersburg than any where else in the World, He read an
        account of "A Colored Funeral"<sup>2</sup> to compliment Fannie's "A
        Colored Wedding" story.

        Clyde Campbell</a> responded to a request for an impromptu speech and
        again the "James Campbell family" was represented.

      <p>

        Seldon Butler</a> favored us with a vocal solo entitled Fast Falls the
        Eventide and responded to the encore with another sacred selection.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I5067">
        Arthur McKean</a> of the "Blackwell family"<sup>5</sup> gave some
        interesting facts about the Blackwells &amp; invited us all to come to
        Troy to examine his family records.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">George Buck</a> reminded us it is real
        worth or character he prizes most in his very favorably recollections
        of his ancestry &amp; he is instilling in the minds of his sons the
        need of "carrying on" - the best from the lives of those who have
        passed on before.
      </p>
      <p>
        After remarks by <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1693">
        Mr. Shuman</a> <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> Mrs. Shaw was
        asked by cousin <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">Frank Campbell</a> to
        favor us with some songs she learned while in the South last winter.
        One of the several selections given was of more than passing interest
        because of the very precious "Truth" couched in the negro
        dialect<sup>3</sup> which ran something like this-<br>
        What done to my Lord by Hisself alone (repeated twice)<br>
        Nailed him to the cross by Hisself alone (repeated twice)<br>
        Never said a mumblin word by Hisself alone (repeated twice)
      </p>
      <p>
        Without doubt it drew out of all of our hearts to a deeper love for Him
        who so willingly gave His life that we through His sacrifice may have
        Eternal Life.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href=

        J. E. Hazlett</a> made a plea for financial help for needed repairs on
        the Beechers Island Pres. Church where many of the Clans forefathers
        worshiped.
      </p>
      <p>
        "America the Beloved" was heartily sung as Chas. Congdon again led
        &amp; thus ended the excellent program provided by our committee
      </p>
      <p>
        Minutes of 1925 meeting were read &amp; approved <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2369">
        E. C. Blackwell</a> presented the financial need &amp; the generous
        offering of $16.50 was given to which cousin <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1760">
        Harry Kemp</a> added another dollar making it $17.50 in all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edward Monroe at this time favored us with two solos which were greatly
        enjoyed by all present.

        Aug. 19, 1926 Minnie J. Lugg, Treas.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. Descendants of James or his brother <a href=
        "CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph Campbell</a>, are also Luggs because
        their wives were daughters of <a href="LuggSarah1777ca.html">Sarah
        Lugg</a>. C. H. Lugg, like all of our cousins that still carry the Lugg
        surname, was a descendant of Sarah's brother, <a href=
        "LuggCharles1791.html">Charles Byron Lugg</a>.
      </p>2. Three of Joseph and Mary Harper Campbell's daughters married
      Hazletts. Fannie was a descendant of <a href="CampbellJane1792.html">Jane
      Campbell</a>, who married John Hazlett. Our other Hazlett branches are
      descendants of Jane's sister, <a href="CampbellSarah1777.html">Sally
      Campbell</a>, who married John's brother, Sam Hazlett. And descendants of
      their sister, <a href="CampbellMary1779.html">Mary Campbell</a>, who
      married a different (as far as we know unrelated) John Hazlett -&nbsp;
      haven't yet participated, but we are now in touch and hope they will join
      us soon.
      <p>
        3. Everyone is a product of their times. It's unfair to judge people
        born and raised in the19th century by the standards of the 21st
        century. Our Campbell Cousins of 1925 were "God fearing" pillars of
        their communities. But racial stereotypes and prejudice were pervasive
        in 1920s&nbsp; America. The '20s &amp; '30s were a high point of KKK
        activity, with hundreds of lynchings. Large KKK parades were held in
        Binghamton and other Northern cities. There were "Jim Crow" laws
        throughout the South. Fortunately our awareness of discrimination and
        prejudice has improved in the last 90 years. But I wonder what things
        in our writings will cause people 90 years from now to say "How could
        they be oblivious of ___?" - wbt

        4. Our Merritts are descendants of Jane CAMPBELL Hazlett. When [Edwin

        5. All of the Blackwells that came to our reunions were descendents of
        <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2434">
        John Blackwell</a> (1734 - 1824), whose will is on our website. Most
        were descendants of his son, <a href="BlackwellEnoch1764ca.html">Enoch
        Blackwell</a> (ca 1764 - 1816), but some were descendents of various
        siblings of Enoch. Enoch had 7 children by his first wife, Hannah
        Perrin, and 2 by his 2nd wife, Sarah Lugg. aaaThe maternal grandfather
        of the speaker, Arthur Blackwell McKean, was a descendant of Hannah
        Perrin. Arthur's maternal grandmother, was a descendant of one of
        Enoch's brothers. It doesn't make genealogical sense, but the attendees
        of these reunions apparently didn't think of James Campbell's
        descendents as also being Luggs and Blackwells. Nor of the descendants
        of his brother, Joseph Campbell as also being Luggs.
