      <big><big><big><big>Elizabeth CAMPBELL Ellison (1789 - 18xx)<br></big></big></big></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big><big><big>Elizabeth was born Jul. 21, 1789, in N. Ireland or possibly Scotland; d. 18xx, in Tioga Co., PA. She married <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I14">Richard Ellison</a>, born in England.<br></big></big></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big><big><big>Elizabeth was the 4th of 8 children of <a href="CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph Campbell</a>, b. 1748, in Scotland, d. 1824 in Nelson, PA, (originally called <a href="BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's Island</a>); and <a href="HarperMary1749.html">Mary Harper</a>, b. 1749, in Scotland, d. 1844 in Nelson.<br></big></big></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big><big>Elizabeth's older sister <a href="CampbellSarah1777.html">Sally</a>, and brother, <a href="CampbellJohn1781.html">John</a>, came to America before their younger siblings. We're not sure exactly when. Sometime between 1800 and 1802 seems likely for Sally and husband <a href="HazlettSamuel1780.html">Sam Hazlett</a> --- their first child, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I38">Archibald Hazlett</a> was born in Lancaster Co., PA in 1803. John, Mary, and Elizabeth Campbell may have come slightly later. Brother John Campbell married soon after his arrival and shortly thereafter moved to what is now Pittsburgh. Mary and husband, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I12">John Hazlett</a> (no known relation to Sam), settled in Lancaster Co. Mary's son Robert, was born in PA in 1809, so we know she was here before then. Elizabeth apparently lived with them.<br></big></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big><big>Elizabeth's parents, and youngest siblings sailed from Londonderry to Perth Amboy, NJ in 1810 and went to Sam Hazlett's farm (he was then living near Stroudsburg, PA) before going to Nelson. Elizabeth apparently did not join them and go to Nelson at that time.<br></big></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big><big>John Campbell and wife <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I13">Elizabeth Bell</a> moved to a farm near Pittsburgh shortly after they married,</big></big> <big><big>before his parents came to America. He and Elizabeth never came to Nelson. John's oldest sister Sarah/Sally, came to America about 1800. John and his sisters, Mary and Elizabeth, may not have come until 1806.</big></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big><big>After Mary's death in 1824, her husband and children moved to a farm near his brother-in-law, John Campbell, in what is now Pittsburgh's North side.<br></big></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big><big>It's not certain when Elizabeth left Lancaster Co., moved to Tioga Co., and married Richard Ellison, one of the early settlers of Beecher's Island.<br></big></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big><big>Elizabeth Campbell and Richard Ellison had no children.<br></big></big>
