        Dear Cousins:-

      <p>
        What a pleasure it is going to be to have my visit with you all while sitting in the car on this glorious sunshiny afternoon. I am waiting for <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1566">Mr. Carey</a> to finish his business at the Union Structural Steel Plant.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        We came to Syracuse this morning from Elmira, a distance of ninety-two miles. With our good New York State roads it makes a very enjoyable trip. The hill sides are still gorgeous with autumn coloring, and as we went over the hills and through the valleys it all seemed so wonderful that I felt thankful to&nbsp; be living.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that you all know that on January 6, 1920, I married my next door neighbor. He has one son, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1567">John B. Jr.</a>, who lives with his <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I13638">grandmother</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have spent a greater part of the time in Pittsburgh, Pa., and the past year in Buffalo where Mr. Carey is located. Just at present we have opened up our home at 439 West Clinton Street, Elmira, and will be here until after Christmas.
      </p>

        I want to you all to know how much I have enjoyed the Cousins letters. It has brought to my mind many pleasant memories of you all.

        With kindest regards from us all to you and your family,

        It was an unexpected pleasure to meet Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I948">Helen Congdon</a> on the train. I should certainly have enjoyed a visit with her at our home.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want you all to know that our home is always open to you. I am always glad to hear Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie Congdon</a>'s voice on the phone as I know then that he will run in between trains and we can have a little chat.
      </p>
      <p>
        With sincere good wishes for your health and happiness,
