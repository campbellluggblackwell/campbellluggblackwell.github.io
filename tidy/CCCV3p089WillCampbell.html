        Dear Campbell Cousins:

        This, seemingly, has been a short year. The Marinette Campbells are all
        in very good health, with no change from one year ago. <a href=

        Bill</a> is attending the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor this
        year, and is spending his Easter vacation with us this week. <a href=

        Henry</a>, still unmarried, is here in business with his dad.

        Louise</a> and I have talked over our trip many times, and the only
        regret we have is the fact that we could not see you all. However,
        those we were fortunate in seeing made us feel so welcome that we shall
        certainly try it again. We had a very happy month with you all.
      </p>

        This winter we intended to make a short visit with our Florida
        relatives, but we have had such wonderful weather here in Wisconsin
        that Florida lost out.

        Speaking of Wisconsin, I hope you don't judge all the people of the
        state by her politics. Without a doubt Wisconsin is one of the greatest
        and most resourceful states in the Union, but <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._La_Follette,_Sr.">LaFollette</a>
        and LaFolettism has unfortunately stamped her people as Socialistic.
        This is not true, and one of these days Socialism in Wisconsin will get
        the licking of its life.
      </p>

        With good wishes for continued success to the Campbell Cousins
        Correspondence, and with love to you all, I am,
