        Dear Cousins:-

      <p>
        It is again time to send our annual greetings to the Cousins.
      </p>

        Although my days are so very interesting to me, it is difficult to select the things that might interest others.<br>

      <p>
        Our church, our clubs, the Parent Teachers Association and the boys all combine to keep us "glad we're livin' ".

        Last summer was full of delightful things,- our trip home which we always look forward to, - a visit from Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1050">Mary</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1051">Al Snavely</a> and wonderful days camping. We camp at a lake near here, so we can all e together all summer. Pittsfield is surrounded by beautiful lakes and we are planning a cottage of our own to be built soon.
      </p>

        We have all been well this winter and the winter has been unusually attractive to the boys -- there has been so much of it, They are interested in school and both are doing well. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I988">Junior</a> has just been elected President of his school club He is becoming very much interested in the Boy Scouts this Spring, and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I992">Marcus</a> is very much disgusted that he isn't old enough to join.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just now we are very much interested in getting a little Spring weather - but it comes very slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eagerly awaiting your letters, I am
