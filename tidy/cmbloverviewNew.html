    </div><br>
    <big><big><big>There are many intermarriages throughout the generations, but here are the early connections. There's lots of overlap in the family trees. Below are selected parts of the trees: first from the CAMPBELLs' viewpoint; then from the LUGG perspective; BLACKWELLs' next; then from the HAZLETT perspective. For simplicity, only the children that "interconnect" are shown. "Sr." and "Jr." were not usually used as part of the names below, but are added to help distinguish father from son, where both have the same name.<br>
    <br>
    [Note the longevity of many of these folks. Infant and child mortality was high, but for those who reached adulthood, a surprising percent lived to "ripe old age".]</big><br>

    <br>
    <big>We haven't been able to trace our Campbells farther back than Joseph Campbell, born 1748 in Scotland, died 1822 in Nelson, Tioga Co., PA and his brother, <a href="CampbellJohn1761.html">John Campbell</a>, born Apr 3, 1761 in Scotland, died Mar 20, 1855, in Nelson. We do not know where in Scotland they were born, nor where in Scotland Mary Harper was born.<br>
    <br>
    John Campbell (b. 1761) was the apparently first of the family to come to America, probably in 1776. He worked as a tailor in Philadelphia and later as a land agent. Next to come were some of Joseph's older children. They initially settled in Lancaster Co., PA. We don't know exactly when they arrived, but Sam and Sally Campbell Hazlett's first child, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I38">Archibald</a>, was born in Lancaster Co. in 1803. Joseph Campbell, wife Mary Harper, and their younger children lived in N. Ireland for about 10 years before sailing from Londonderry to Perth Amboy, NJ in 1810.<br>
    <br>
    John Campbell married a widow, <a href="LuggSarah1777ca.html">Sarah LUGG</a> Clinch Blackwell in 1818. Sarah Lugg was born in Bisley, Gloucestershire, abt. 1777. Sarah first married <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I20">Thomas Clinch</a> and had a daughter, <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann Clinch</a>, b. 1804 in Avening, Gloucestershire. In 1804 Sarah, Thomas and infant Ann sailed from Bristol to Philadelphia. On board was a widower, <a href="BlackwellEnoch1764ca.html">Enoch Blackwell</a> (also from Avening, born there about 1764) his children, and several of his siblings. In 1805, Thomas Clinch died in NYC of yellow fever. Soon after, Sarah and Enoch married. According to Ann's daughter <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Jane CAMPBELL Tubbs</a> (1834 - 1916), Ann was given to Enoch's brother <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2682">Peter Blackwell</a> and raised near New Hope, PA. But the late <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2956">Stella MAUGERI Blackwell</a>, a Blackwell family researcher, believed Ann was raised by brother <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2677">Joshua Blackwell</a>, not Peter.<br>
    <br>
    Sarah and Enoch lived in Lycoming Co., PA, where their two children were born: <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary Blackwell</a> in 1806, and <a href="BlackwellEnoch1814.html">Enoch</a> in 1814. Enoch "Sr." died in 1816. After Sarah married John Campbell in 1818 and John, Sarah, Mary, and Enoch "Jr." lived in Nelson. In 1821 Sarah decided two of John's nephews would make good husbands for her daughters. She wrote to Ann Clinch, inviting her to come to Nelson to marry <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph Campbell</a> "Jr." Daughter Mary Blackwell married <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James Campbell</a>. The two sets of siblings married a week apart in 1822.</big><br>

    <big><big>Both Sarah Lugg, mentioned above, and later her brother, Charles Byron Lugg, b. 1791 in Bisley, came to America. She was the eldest, and he the 6th, of Robert and Mary Ann Lugg's 7 children. Sarah Lugg's 3rd husband was John Campbell. Sarah's daughters (Ann Clinch and Mary Blackwell) married John's nephews Joseph and James Campbell. Sarah's son, Enoch Blackwell "Jr." married three times. His second wife was his first cousin, Caroline Lugg. Caroline was the mother of his only child, Enoch Charles Blackwell, b. 1867. Enoch Blackwell "Jr." was the heir of his step-father, John Campbell. We have several generations of Robert Lugg's ancestry.</big><br>

    <big>The elder Enoch Blackwell's tree is embedded in the LUGG tree above, except for his first marriage. Enoch Blackwell, b. abt. 1764 in Avening, Gloucestershire first married <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I27">Hannah Perrine</a>, who died in Gloucestershire before he emigrated. They had 7 children, at least 5 of whom came to America with Enoch. Enoch was from a family of 10 children. At least 3 of his siblings came to America: <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2636">Thomas</a>, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2677">Joshua</a>, and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2682">Peter</a>. We have several generations of Enoch's ancestry. Enoch "Sr." was Sarah Lugg's 2nd husband, and had two children by her: Mary Blackwell (who married James Campbell) and Enoch Blackwell, who married 3 times.</big><br>

Sisters Sarah (Sally), b. 1777, and Jane, b. 1792 married brothers Samuel, b. 1780, and John, b. abt. 1787, both in Scotland. We know their father's name, and two of their siblings, but do not know their birthplace. Mary Campbell, b. 1779, never came to Nelson. She too married a John Hazlett, but in Lancaster, PA. He was born 1783 in County Down, Ireland. As far as we know, he was not related to the other Hazletts. The children of John and Mary moved to Allegheny Co., PA to be with the families of Mary's brother, John Campbell, b. 1781. Sam Hazlett's <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I14338">mother</a>, his sister <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I3437">Mary</a>, and his brother, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I18">Archibald</a> also settled in Allegheny Co., PA. We have not been able to trace back beyond Robert Hazlett. Or even identify which of the many Robert Hazletts he is.<br>

    HISTORY'S MYSTERIES.<br>
    The story of Sarah Lugg and Ann Clinch has always intrigued me.</big></big></big>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <big><big><big>Why did Sarah Lugg give baby daughter Ann Clinch to one of Enoch Blackwell's brothers to raise?</big></big></big><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <big><big><big>Did Ann and Sarah ever see each other from the time of Sarah's 2nd marriage?</big></big></big><br>

      <li>
        <big><big><big>Did they correspond?</big></big></big><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <big><big><big>Why did Sarah feel that Ann should marry her nephew, Joseph Campbell (the younger)?</big></big></big><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <big><big><big>How did Ann feel about Sarah's matchmaking? Was she reluctant to leave the well established communities around New Hope, Bucks Co., PA, or adjacent Lambertville, Hunterdon Co., NJ, for Beecher's Island --- which was still the wild frontier?<br></big></big></big>
      </li>
      <li>
        <big><big><big>How did Ann's foster parents feel about her departure knowing they would probably never see her again?</big></big></big>

        <big>How did Joseph feel about being sent to New Hope to court his aunt's daughter?</big>
