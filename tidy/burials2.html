    <p>
      <big><big>Many of our readers, when traveling (especially to our <a href="reunion2012.html">Campbells of Nelson Reunions</a>) would be interested in visiting the graves of their relatives. To help with this, we have created a list of <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">all</span> our known burials, domestic and foreign. It's sorted by:<br></big></big>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <big>State (or country)/County/Municipality</big>
      </li>
      <li>
        <big>Cemetery</big>
      </li>
      <li>
        <big>Birth Surname &amp;</big>
      </li>
      <li>
        <big>First Name</big>
      </li>
    </ul><big><big>It's a work in progress, but includes all known burials.</big></big><br>

    Volunteers are needed to help add the burial lot info. Anyone reading this page has the necessary skills. I'll give you the URLs for looking up the data. I could do it all myself, but I have a lot of other things to do, and this is an easy way for you to help out with this web site. Your assistance will be appreciated and you will be given credit for your help. See our <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?db=capane&amp;I11.x=27&amp;I11.y=7">tree</a> for contact info.<br>
