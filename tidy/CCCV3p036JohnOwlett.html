        Dear Cousins and All:
      </p>

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Well, it is something unusual for me to write a letter, but I will try to make a few remarks if it is not too late.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been busy, and like all the rest of the folks on a farm have had plenty of chores and mud to take up time. We are all well at present, and have been lucky this winter in having only a few colds to bother us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have seen <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Mother</a> but once since she returned from Washington, D.C., and New York, but shall look for her to make some more visits soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have had very bad roads this spring, but we all hope from now on it will be better getting around. It acts very much as if spring had come at last, although the nights are cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope this letter will be on time, and I shall try to be a little more prompt next time.
      </p>
