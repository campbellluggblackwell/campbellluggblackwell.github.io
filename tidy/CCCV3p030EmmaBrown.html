        Dear Campbell Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        As I was sweeping this morning I ran across the letter from Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1505">Roswell Young</a>. I had not known that I was to be included in this Cousins Club. I was very glad to receive one of the volumes of "cousins letters" which my brother, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1448">Ross Van Dusen</a>, brought to me. Many thanks to Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">William Selph</a>, I have spent many happy moments reading the letters. It seems as if I were acquainted with all the cousins after reading the letters, although there are a great many of them whom I have never seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        We live on a farm, and I have lots of work to do, so letter writing looks like a big task.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I guess that I have said enough for this time. I promise to do better next time.
      </p>

    <div class="Closing">
      <p>
        Sincerely,
      </p>
