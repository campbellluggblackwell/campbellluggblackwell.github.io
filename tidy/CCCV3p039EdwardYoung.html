        Dear Campbell Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        This seems to be a most appropriate day for me to be attending to my
        correspondence. My letters are always a surprise, although not always a
        delightful one.
      </p>
      <p>
        A couple of weeks ago I received a letter from my brother <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1505">
        Roswell</a> addressing me as "Dear Campbell Cousin". Evidently with the
        true Bostonian aloofness he reuses to make the horrible admission that
        I am his brother. But I know why it is. He's jealous that I have some
        hair on the top of my head. If we stand alongside each other with our
        heads uncovered in a public place he's simply embarrassed to tears.
        Don't worry, though, about his losing his hair. He lost it long before
        he was married - in fact way back in the days when he was a freshman at
        college. It must have been due to over-study (?) .
      </p>
      <p>
        However, he asked me to write a letter to my cousins and not a
        dissertation on hair. When one writes to one's cousins, what should one
        write? What one has been doing? That's just a bit risky.
      </p>

        Last week a baritone from New York and I gave a concert in Hornell, New
        York. Several of my relatives were there including my <a href=
        "YoungPhilip1866.html">father</a>, <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1501">
        sister</a> and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1502">
        brother-in-law</a>; also - a friend of mine came on from Buffalo to
        attend the concert. Now, you wouldn't jump at a conclusion like that -
        I didn't say it was a young lady friend! The following morning we all
        rode back to Elmira in my father's new car. Say, by the way, I suppose
        you all know that I have a new <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1533">
        sister-in-law</a>. You just bet your life I have. I flatter myself that
        I helped to complete the job by pushing down the keys on the organ
        while my brother <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1532">
        Clifford</a>'s knees behaved in a most mysterious manner. I am the only
        one now in the Young family that isn't signed up for life.

        Perhaps you will be interested to know that I am still doing my bit
        toward making New York a noisier place by pursuing the musical
        profession. Yesterday I started organ lessons with <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Tertius_Noble">Tertius
        Noble</a><sup>1</sup>, the organist at St. Thomas' Fifth Avenue Church.
        He is considered on of the greatest organists in the country, but he
        will not have that marvellous <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>
        disposition when he gets through with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having complied with Roswell's request, I shall now look forward to
        hearing all about my Campbell Cousins who are scattered all over the
        country. No one state seems to have been big enough to keep more than a
        few of them.

        with (one of these days I hope to add his letters to our web site), the
