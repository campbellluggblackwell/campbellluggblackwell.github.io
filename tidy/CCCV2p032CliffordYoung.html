        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Just a brief word of cordial greetings to you all!
      </p>
      <p>
        Probably like the rest of my Cousins, in reply to my Cousin's letter, I immediately asked what I should write about, and was told to write about myself. That isn't much to write about, but here goes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The life of a clergyman in a metropolitan suburb offers plenty of variety in its own way, yet there isn't much that would be of newsy interest to others. My church is raising funds for a Manse, and I am hoping to be married before long and "settle down" in that long-looked-for home of my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope this will find you well and happy, and shall be glad to hear from you individually.
      </p>
