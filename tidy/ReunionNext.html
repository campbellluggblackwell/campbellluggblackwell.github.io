        Since 2014, our reunions have been held every other year, on the first Saturday of August, in even numbered years. Last year's reunion was held Sat., Aug 1, 2020. But because of the COVID-19 pandemic, for the first time, instead of being held in person, we did it by televideo -- via ZOOM.
      </p>

        We missed the comradery of meeting in person, and the pleasure of sharing a pot luck meal. BUT, it provided an opportunity for many to join us for the first time. Cost, travel time, being a caregiver to others, infirmities of age, etc. instantly faded. For instance, a cousin joined us from a remote part of British Columbia who would not have come to Nelson. Perhaps cousins from other countries may decide to participate in the future -- no Visa &amp; passport needed. Nor airfare, hotels, meals, etc. (I met one of our English cousins years ago -- it would be great to meet more.)

        Because the logistics of holding Zoom reunions are easier to arrange than for in-person gatherings, we may hold one this year. If so, it will be via ZOOM (or a similar product). It's too soon to know, but depending on the course of the pandemic, it may be possible to have an a single, in-person event in our near Nelson -- or perhaps a number of small gatherings, all over the country -- all connected via ZOOM (or the equivalent). People are getting vaccinated at an increasing rate --- an encouraging sign of getting the pandemic under control. But the virus is mutating and new strains are more contagious. Hospitalization rates and daily deaths remain high. And many people are afraid of vaccines. So, we'll "play it by ear" and make decisions as a clearer picture unfolds.
