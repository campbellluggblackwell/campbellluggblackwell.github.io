Their home was on the edge of a small lake, in a new undeveloped section of the country when we were there;‑ not much cleared land about. We stayed all night with them; he had a small cleared field up north of the house on which they had raised Buckwheat, and Herb arranged that he and I should get up early the next morning and go up there and shoot some prairie chickens. We went, and he allowed me to carry the gun and do the shooting. I shot two, and we had them for dinner. We hired a livery to take us from Brainerd out to his farm, and as I remember, it was about six miles, through winding sandy wood roads part of the way. But a straight laid out highway was in the making by his place, and he had given the Township a Schoolhouse site on his farm on which they were to erect a Public School.<br></font></font></font></font>

We did not run it this year, but rented it to a party from Syracuse,‑ and we rented a small Cottage among some fine sheltering Oaks, a few blocks away, just large enough so we could have them with us, and we did enjoy<br></font></font></font></font>

The fact is, I had taken on a forty acre tract just in the City limits, and sub‑divided it and my time was occupied looking after that. We built as Office out there, and kept a Real Estate Agent there all the time. Have also put up eight houses and sold them, so manage to keep busy most of the time; but shall try and go North for a couple of months this Summer if I can possibly leave.<br></font></font></font>
