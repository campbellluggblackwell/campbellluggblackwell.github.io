          <font face="Courier, monospace"><font size="4">Dear Cousins:-<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having looked forward to this letter (not
          with delight) for a matter of six weeks or two months, and having,
          from time to tire received gentle hints, or, better yet, very
          carefully worded duns from <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin
          Will</a>; ­"who by the way has been very patient", I think it about
          time I made some kind of an attempt to use up some of the paper he
          has sent me.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was raking leaves this afternoon and it
          made me think that perhaps, I might be shoveling snow from the same
          place before many weeks have gone. I can't make it seem possible our
          summer is over.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In regard to my work, ‑ I am agent and
          operator for the New York Central rail road Company at Ansonia, Pa.,
          ‑ two miles from where we live at Asaph. I drive back and forth in
          summer, and walk in winter. Just at present, traffic on the Railroad
          is rather heavy and we are unusually busy. The greater part of
          traffic on this Division is Bituminous Coal from the Pittsburgh
          District.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ansonia is located eleven miles from
          Wellsboro on Pine Creek and at this time of the year the mountains
          here are wonderful. Only wish you people could be here and enjoy them
          with us. Hunting and fishing is of the best,- bear, deer, partridge,
          squirrels and rabbits in abundance. Trout (Brook and German Brown),
          bass and pickerel. Don't it make your mouth water and your blood
          tingle?<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally am looking forward and making
          plans for November 1st, when the hunting season will be open. Perhaps
          I may be disappointed; for two years now I have made the same plans,
          and found it impossible to fulfill them on account of shortage of
          help on the Railroad, but am living in hopes this year.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My <a href="SeelyAda1858.html">Mother</a>
          and also <a href=
          "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I456">
          Mother Seely</a> live alone in <a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osceola_Township,_Tioga_County,_Pennsylvania">
          Osceola</a>. We get over to see them about once a week during the
          summer. Only wish we could all be together, but habits of a life time
          are hard to break, and our Mothers seem to think there is only one
          town in the U.S.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been unable to get the photos for
          the reason that we are seldom in Osceola in the daytime when it is
          possible to take pictures and as we want the three of us on one
          picture, will have to send them later. Am very sorry I couldn't get
          them in for this half.<br>
