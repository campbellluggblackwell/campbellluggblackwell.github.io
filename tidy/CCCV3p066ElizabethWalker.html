        Dear Cousins:

      <p>
        How soon a year passes! It seems but a short time since we received the last Cousins book of letters.

        We have had a cold winter with lots of snow. One day <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1277">Roy</a> came home and said he heard a message going over the wire to a party in St. Petersburg, Florida, to the Campbell House<sup>1</sup>, We had about forty inches of snow at that time, and wished we were in the "Sunny South", but the nearest we got was Miama <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> Beach (on the radio).
      </p>
      <p>
        We have all been well this past year. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1282">David</a> is thirteen months old and gets into all kinds of mischief. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1278">Joseph</a> is in school and very much interested in trout fishing at present<sup>2</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last week we had company from Pennsylvania for the week-end. We are always so glad to see our old friends from "home".
      </p>
      <p>
        Had a letter from <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1595">Treva Hazlett</a> a short time ago asking if we couldn’t plan to come home for the reunion. We had planned to go in June as soon as Joseph is out of school, so I'm afraid that we shall have to miss the reunion again this year.

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. Roy was a freight agent for the DL&amp;W RR. Apparently he knew Morse Code and could translate the outgoing telegram as he heard it. He mentoned it to Betty because Campbell House was a hotel in St. Pete owned by Cousin Tommie Campbell.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Dave, like his dad, was an enthusiastic trout fisherman But Joe, and later Betty &amp; Roy move to FL where the water's too warm for trout fishing. I'm not sure about Joe, but Roy switched to deep sea fishing after the move.
