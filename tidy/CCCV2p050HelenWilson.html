      <p>
        I am very glad to contribute a message to the Cousins Correspondence. I
        always enjoy reading the letters from the others as soon as they are
        received.

        George Robert</a>, we are very busy and happy. The boys are both in
        Junior High School, -- are both very musical and are playing some
        instrument or whistling most of the time. George Robert is twelve years
        old and plays instruments from Jews Harp to violin upon which he is
        taking lessons. Richard, fourteen years old, enjoys his drum. I am
        teaching music and have an orchestra of eleven children which we call
        the Mah Jongg Orchestra. We all love music.
