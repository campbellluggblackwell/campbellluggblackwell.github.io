        Dear Cousins:

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I am very glad to contribute a message to the Cousins Correspondence. I always enjoy reading the letters from the others as soon as they are received.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the two boys, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I783">Richard</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I785">George Robert</a>, we are very busy and happy. The boys are both in Junior High School, -- are both very musical and are playing some instrument or whistling most of the time. George Robert is twelve years old and plays instruments from Jews Harp to violin upon which he is taking lessons. Richard, fourteen years old, enjoys his drum. I am teaching music and have an orchestra of eleven children which we call the Mah Jongg Orchestra. We all love music.
