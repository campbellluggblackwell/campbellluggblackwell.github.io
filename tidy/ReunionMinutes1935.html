      <p>
        1. Presumably Will sent a copy or the chart in response to a motion at
        the 1934 Reunion which created a committee to "look up family tree" and
        Harry Kemp was appointed its chair. That seems strange because in 1924
        Will Selph had given out more than 100 copies of a beautifully drawn
        chart (in a style rather like a spreadsheet). And in 1923 through 1926
        more than 100 of Joseph and Ann Clinch Campbell's descendants had
        copies of the 4 volums of the Campbell Cousins Correspondence --
        including Kate Horton &amp; Mabel Shaw who were present. By 1935 there
        was another generation to add. But Will's chart and <a href=
        "CampbellJane1834.html">Jane Campbell</a> Tubbs' reports in CCC Vol.4
        seem to have been forgotten. In addition, many of those now active in
        the reunions (including Clyde Campbell and Harry Kemp) were descendants
        of Joseph's brother, <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James
        Campbell</a> and his wife, <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary
        Blackwell</a> who was Ann's half-sister.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        2. Perhaps Harry only talked about the descendants of his mother,
        Harriet (Campbell) Parks Kemp. But I expect he talked about the
        descendants of her parents, <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James
        Campbell</a> and his wife, <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary
        Blackwell</a>. Fannie Monroe was appointed chair of a committee to
        comile a Hazlett family tree, but their efforts were not reported until
        the 1937 reunion.
