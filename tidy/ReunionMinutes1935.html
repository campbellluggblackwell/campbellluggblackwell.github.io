    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. Presumably Will sent a copy or the chart in response to a motion at the 1934 Reunion which created a committee to "look up family tree" and Harry Kemp was appointed its chair. That seems strange because in 1924 Will Selph had given out more than 100 copies of a beautifully drawn chart (in a style rather like a spreadsheet). And in 1923 through 1926 more than 100 of Joseph and Ann Clinch Campbell's descendants had copies of the 4 volums of the Campbell Cousins Correspondence -- including Kate Horton &amp; Mabel Shaw who were present. By 1935 there was another generation to add. But Will's chart and <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Jane Campbell</a> Tubbs' reports in CCC Vol.4 seem to have been forgotten. In addition, many of those now active in the reunions (including Clyde Campbell and Harry Kemp) were descendants of Joseph's brother, <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James Campbell</a> and his wife, <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary Blackwell</a> who was Ann's half-sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Perhaps Harry only talked about the descendants of his mother, Harriet (Campbell) Parks Kemp. But I expect he talked about the descendants of her parents, <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James Campbell</a> and his wife, <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary Blackwell</a>. Fannie Monroe was appointed chair of a committee to comile a Hazlett family tree, but their efforts were not reported until the 1937 reunion.
