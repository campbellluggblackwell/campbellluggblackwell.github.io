        The Campbell family reunion was held on the Nelson High School grounds on Thursday last and 150 Campbells or near relatives joined in the pleasures of that occasion. The lunch was a composite representative of the culinary skill of the family and for centuries back when the Campbells clan which was always one ot the most powerful of all Scotland they were noted for good living, refreshments were therefore fine and correspondingly enjoyed. After dinner a short program was rendered.&nbsp;<a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1478">Harry Campbell</a>, of Elmira sang two vocal solos and <a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">Mark Seely</a> read a history of the Campbell family of Argyle, Scotland whose descendents <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> the Cowanesque Campbells are. The article was a very interesting one and the fact was pointed out that the Eighth Duke of Agyle is a blood relative of the Campbells that joined in the reunion.<sup>1</sup>

        The social intercourse was the real feature of the day and when the trains again diffused Scotland's best blood over Southern New York and Northern Pennsylvania it was with real regret that the goodbyes were said. A very neat badge was supplied each member and on it was stamped the Campbell crest and the date and place of the annual reunion. The president chosen for the next reunion was <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">T. C. Campbell</a>, of Knoxville, the place of the meeting the same as this year and the date the third Thursday of August.

        1. In Scotland, the Campbells were divided into several clans, all of whom acknowleged the Duke of Argyll as their high chief. Among the major branches were: Campbells of Argyll; Breadalbane; Cawdor; and Louden. We know the grandchildren of brothers Joseph and James Campbell believed they were from the Argyll branch and "blood relatives" of the 8th Duke. But we don't know if that was just an oral tradition or if they had evidence for that. No documentation is know to survive.
