        <span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">Campbell Reunions</span> were held from 1893 through 1942 and resumed in 2000. Recently they've held in even numbered years, but thanks to ZOOM, we may hold them annually again. Initially they were primarily for the descendants of Joseph and Ann Clinch Campbell. But after the first year expanded to include their siblings, James and Mary Blackwell Campbell --- and other connected Luggs and Blackwells. Descendants of Joseph and James siblings, Sally CAMPBELL Hazlett and Jane CAMPBELL Hazlett participated and were officers. Friends and relatives also attended, sometimes more than 600 came for dinner, a program and a meeting.. In the modern series, attendance has been 50 or less.

        <span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">Campbell Cousins Dinners</span> were held from 19xx to 19xx. Until their last few years they were only for the 30 grandchildren of Joseph and Ann Clinch Campbell --- and whoever else the hostess chose to invite. But as those first cousins were dying out, they began inviting the next two generations.
