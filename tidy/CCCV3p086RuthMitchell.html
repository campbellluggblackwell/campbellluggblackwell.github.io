        Dear Campbell Cousins:

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Here we are, most pleasantly located in the "Sunshine City" thanks to
        my <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Father</a>! He has bought a
        beautiful home on the North Shore for us to live in, and "<a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1704">Mitch</a>"
        is working in the office, trying to relieve Papa of some of his too
        numerous responsibilities; and besides doing that, not being able to
        divorce himself altogether from the theatrical world<sup>1</sup>, he is
        one-third owner and manager of a family motion picture venture. The
        other members of the firm are our brother-in-law, <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1693">
        Curt</a>, and Cousin <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1681">
        Ford Pratt</a> of Scranton, Pennsylvania. So far everything but an
        earthquake has happened to discourage the boys, but they have decided
        to keep trying until an earthquake comes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are enjoying our privilege of a warm climate. Have been bathing in
        the Gulf of Mexico today, and the boys, <a href=

        Bob</a>, five and a half years old and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1706">
        Bud</a>, four,--well you would simply have to see them to appreciate
        how much they enjoy it all. A world of sand and water just for
        playing!.
      </p>
      <p>
        I expect that <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1692">
        Mary</a> and Papa have written just the only things I can think to say,
        but please don't mind, for we are all too busy enjoying ourselves to
        write everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good bye and love to all,
      </p>

        1. Before leaving Rochester, NY, he owned several movie theaters. His
        movie enterprise in St. Pete, which was segregated then, was outdoor
        showings of movies, with chairs, for "colored people."
