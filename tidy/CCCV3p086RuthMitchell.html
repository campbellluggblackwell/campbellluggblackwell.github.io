        Dear Campbell Cousins:
      </p>

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Here we are, most pleasantly located in the "Sunshine City" thanks to my <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Father</a>! He has bought a beautiful home on the North Shore for us to live in, and "<a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1704">Mitch</a>" is working in the office, trying to relieve Papa of some of his too numerous responsibilities; and besides doing that, not being able to divorce himself altogether from the theatrical world<sup>1</sup>, he is one-third owner and manager of a family motion picture venture. The other members of the firm are our brother-in-law, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1693">Curt</a>, and Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1681">Ford Pratt</a> of Scranton, Pennsylvania. So far everything but an earthquake has happened to discourage the boys, but they have decided to keep trying until an earthquake comes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are enjoying our privilege of a warm climate. Have been bathing in the Gulf of Mexico today, and the boys, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1705">Bob</a>, five and a half years old and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1706">Bud</a>, four,--well you would simply have to see them to appreciate how much they enjoy it all. A world of sand and water just for playing!.
      </p>
      <p>
        I expect that <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1692">Mary</a> and Papa have written just the only things I can think to say, but please don't mind, for we are all too busy enjoying ourselves to write everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good bye and love to all,
      </p>

        1. Before leaving Rochester, NY, he owned several movie theaters. His movie enterprise in St. Pete, which was segregated then, was outdoor showings of movies, with chairs, for "colored people."
