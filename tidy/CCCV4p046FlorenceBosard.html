        My dear Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I have been reminded several times that my letter was overdue and I think I had better get busy before I have another reminder.
      </p>
      <p>
        It does not seem possible that another year has passed for time passes so rapidly. This has been a busy year for us us and I know that it is for most every one. I have been especially busy at the office these last few months for I have had added responsibilities and you know that keeping some of the income tax returns straight for "Uncle Sam" is quite a proposition<sup>1</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early last summer I spent ten days in Chicago with friends and as it was my first visit there I thoroughly enjoyed myself and on my return trip home I stopped in Elmira for a few days and visited with my old friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1050">Mary</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1051">her husband</a> and I had talked for a long time of going to the Cousins Dinner and finally decided that we would go and drive. We took five days for the trip and enjoyed it very much. Our first night we spent at Montoursville, Pa. with our Cousin Myra Bosard Bosworth<sup>2</sup> whom a great many of you know. The next night we were in Addison with some of <a href="CraneJennie1852.html">mother</a>'s family and left early Tuesday morning for Osceola. Mary and I had never attended one of the Dinners an we were surely well repaid. <a href="TubbsMinnie1864.html">Cousin Minnie</a> was a royal hostess and the reunion was continued in the evening at <a href="SeelyAda1858.html">Cousin Ada</a>'s where we remained for the night. We started on our return trip Wednesday morning in a snow storm, reaching Harrisburg that night and on to Washington Thursday in a pouring rain. We were all tired but had a very pleasant trip.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cousin <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">Mary Shipman</a> called the house one evening when she was on her way to Florida<sup>3</sup>. It seemed so good to hear her voice and Mary and I had a nice visit with her. I know she has had a wonderful winter with all her family<sup>4</sup>. We hope to see them on their return trip North.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cousin <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">George Buck</a> spent a few days with us recently and we enjoyed so much having him with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Washington is beginning to look like Spring and I think it will not be many days before the trees and flowers will show their buds quite plainly. We are looking forward to the cherry blossoms which will be in full bloom probably in about ten days or two weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that there are two more letters from our house so I will leave the rest for them to tell.
      </p>
      <p>
        With best wishes to all,

        1. She was an IRS auditor.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Myra was her and Florence' second cousin, but not a Campbell Cousin.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Long distance calls were very expensive, so phoning when it could be a local call was practical.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. She spent that winter in St. Pete with her brother, <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie Campbell</a>, his wife (Campbell Cousin <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">Frances Parks</a>), their 2 daughters and grandchildren.
