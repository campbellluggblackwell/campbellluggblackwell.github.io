        My Dear Campbell Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        One of my strong points is "always being on time." For several days I
        have been receiving letters from all points of the compass asking me to
        hurry with my letter; as I would not like the 100% to fall short on my
        account I am hurrying. However, it seems I have not much to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        The event in my family since my last letter is the marriage of my
        niece, <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1285">
        Isabelle</a>, on June 15, 1925, to <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1286">
        Thomas Field</a> of Elmira, - where they reside. My sister<sup>1</sup>,
        <a href="GoodrichFrances1871.html">Frances</a>, lives with them.
        Isabelle keeps her position as Physical Culture Teacher, and Tom has a
        responsible position with the James Manufacturing Co., in their Office.
      </p>
      <p>
        In December, I spent one week with my three girls, - going first to
        Binghamton to see <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1250">
        Jessie</a>. She teaches and the two older children, <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1256">
        Walter Jr.</a> or "Tom" as we call him and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1262">
        Anne Betty</a>, go to school, while <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1266">
        Henry</a> who is three years old and a curly and yellow haired blue
        eyed darling, if he doesn't take kindly to one calls them a
        "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">bum</span>" no matter
        whether it be the Minister or the County Superintendent. Tom is very
        bright in school work and began music but his mother decided he wasn't
        strong enough yet for so much. Anne Betty is a lovely little girl, very
        dark hair and complexion and eyes. I am "Granny" to Jessie's children.
        Jessie has a housekeeper to take care of the baby through the day.
        <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1251">
        Walter</a>, has the same work as last year, gets good pay, has several
        men under his management as he is an expert workman, - gets pretty mad
        at some of them at times.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Binghamton I went North to North Brookfield, N.Y., where <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1276">
        Elizabeth</a> still lives, <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1277">
        Roy</a> works for the D.L.&amp;W. Railroad Co., also sells Atwater Kent
        Radios. As I could hear very well over the radio<sup>2</sup> I intend
        to have one: think maybe I can get it cheap as they are in the family,
        I reached there Sunday morning, found Betty entertaining the
        entertainer on the lyceum courses for over Sunday.<br>

        letter, Inez was quite deaf.

        Betty finds time besides her own work and caring for two lively boys,
        <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1278">
        Joseph</a>, who is nine and looks like his mother and is a very
        agreeable little fellow, and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1282">
        David</a> who is two and a little black eyed imp, -- to belong to the
        Eastern Star, the <a href="http://www.iokds.org/">King's daughters</a>
        and helps in two Church Aid Societies and everything of that kind. I
        heard a sermon over the radio by a Presbyterian Minister in Pittsburg
        <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> and heard every word and all the
        music, which was quite wonderful to me as I had not heard a service for
        years.
      </p>
      <p>
        From North Brookfield, I went to Elmira<sup>3</sup> to see Isabelle and
        Tom. They took me to a good show that evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        I arrived home after one most delightful week. As I left a man and wife
        to keep house, <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1292">
        William</a> was well cared for.<sup>4</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are both very well and very busy. William has the same line of work
        as last year.

      <p>
        We were shocked to hear of Cousin <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil
        Young</a>'s death.

      <p>
        To each of you I send this wish:-

      <blockquote>
        "For you I pray, along life's way<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mind with calm contentment

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good store of health, with some of

        4. It seems strange to me, because my earliest memories of him are of a
        widower who had been "bach'ing it" as long as I had known him (and
        longer). He was able bodied --- working a farm and having a milk route
        where he'd picked up dairy farmers milk cans and took them to a
        creamery each morning. But at the time, it was not unusual for a man
        not to know how to cook, do laundry, etc. And with two jobs he may not
        have had much time or energy for those tasks even if he did know how.
