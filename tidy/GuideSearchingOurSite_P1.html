      <h3>
        Our Website
      </h3>
      <p class="FirstP">
        Our family history website has more than 500 pages of old letters,
        photos, news clips, family records, etc. But sometimes it can seem "an
        embarrassment of riches." How can you find the items you'd like to see?
        Especially when you don't know what's there?
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a menu on the left side. And some of the items listed are
        tables of contents to sections of it. But unlike a book, it doesn't
        have an overall table of contents.
      </p>
      <h3>
        "Googling"
      </h3>
      <p class="FirstP">
        Like most websites, this one is indexed by the major search engines
        such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc. So you can search for its pages the
        way you search any website. But those tools search millions of web
        sites, and list hits from the most popular websites first, so you may
        see results from countless other web sites at the top of your list of
        "hits." Moreover they apparently only index it once a month, so there
        is a lag between when we add or modify a web page and when they will
        "discover" the change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even worse, they can only search the words that appear on the web
        pages. For example a letter may sometimes refer to say, Elisha Shore
        Horton, as <em>father</em>, <em>Lish</em> or <em>E. S. Horton</em>. The
        word matching algorithms of the major search engines can easily miss
        the document you are looking for. And, if you search for
        <em>father</em> you'd be inundated by millions of hits.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Our Site Specific Search Engine
      </h3>
      <p class="FirstP">
        Fortunately there's an alternative, a tool that searches only this
        site. Searching a single site is much faster than searching the entire
        web. The search engine we're using, <em>FreeFind</em>, indexes our site
        at least weekly, rather than only monthly. Even more important, it can
        search not only on words that occur in the document, but on index terms
        <em>(keywords)</em> that have been added by volunteers. (That's one of
        the areas we're looking for help with.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[In this page 1 of a "users manual", guidebook, tutorial or
        whatever you want to call it, I will try to present the basics of
        searching our website. Page 2 will cover "the bells and whistles" and
        page 3 will be case studies of actual searches by users.]</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="SearchBox.jpg" alt="image of search box" style=
        "float: left; width: 172px; height: 180px; margin-right:50"> The search
        window is located at the upper left of our website's home page.&nbsp;
        Looking at it you will see a link, <em>search tips</em>, followed by
        another link, <em>advanced search</em>. Below them is the search box,
        followed by a button labeled <em>search</em>. First we'll discuss the
        mechanics of how they work (which most of you can figure out from
        clicking on the <a href=
        "https://www.freefind.com/searchtipspop.html">search tips</a> button,
        most of which is discussed below) -- followed by search strategies well
        suited to this site. <span class="Annotation">(If you feel like you
        have plenty of experience doing searches you may want to skip ahead to
        the "Smart Searching" section.)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>FUNDAMENTALS</strong>. You can type one or more words (or even
        just strings of characters)and click on the button. If you type
        <em>cat</em> and click, it will give you a list of all the web pages on
        this site that contain the word 'cat'. If you type in <em>cat dog
        pig</em>, it will give you a list of all the web pages that contain the
        word 'cat', or the word 'dog', or the word 'pig'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose we want to see just those pages that only contain the phrase
        <em>Elisha Horton</em>, not just all that contain 'Elisha' and all
        containing 'Horton'. To do that enter <em>"Elisha Horton"</em>,
        enclosed in quotes, into the search box.
      </p>
      <div style="clear: both;"></div>
      <div>
        <h3>
          Knowing the Territory
        </h3>
        <p class="FirstP">
          A character in the play <em>Music Man</em> proclaimed "Ya gotta know
          the territory." Obviously knowing what's on the site isn't a
          prerequisite for searching the site. But familiarity with the way the
          writers of the documents expressed themselves helps. For example, if
          you read a lot of the documents on this site you'll see that men
          often <strong>used initials</strong> instead of first and middle
          names. "T. C. Campbell", "M. B. Seely", "J. Edward Hazlett", etc. So,
          a search for "Thomas Campbell" or "Mark Seely" or "James Hazlett"
          will miss those documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Name Flipping/omitting:</strong> You also have a better
          chance of finding the document you want if you realize that in those
          days it was common for someone to "flip" their first and last names
          -- "Phoebe Jessica Hoyt" became "Jessica Phoebe Hoyt"; "Thomas Edgar
          Congdon" became "Edgar Thomas Congdon", etc. Searchers need to be
          flexible and search multiple ways. Or, especially with women,
          sometimes drop their first name entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Spelling Variations:</strong> Spelling rules weren't rigid.
          Phebe (Campbell) Hoyt always spelled her given name without the 'o'.
          If you only search for <em>Phoebe</em> you'll miss a lot of web pages
          <span class="Annotation">[unless indexing volunteers come to your
          rescue]</span>. Many names have variant spellings: Green/Greene,
          Seely/Seeley, Mourie/Mourey/Mowrey, Haslet/Hazelett/Hazels/Hazlett.
          Even Johnson/Yonson.
        </p>
        <p>
          But those problems almost disappear for our web pages that have been
          indexed by a <a href=
          "https:sties.rootsweb.com/capane/volunteer.html">volunteer</a>. Our
          site's search engine, <em>FreeFind</em>, can recognize index terms
          that have been added to a document. When it's not clear who a
          document is referring to, we've added links that make it clear to
          human readers who is being talked about. But the contents of the
          links isn't accessible by search engines -- they only "see" words
          that occur in the document. If a document mentions "Lish", a
          volunteer indexing the webpage can add "Elisha Horton" as a
          <strong>keyword</strong>. <span class="Annotation">[The indexer knows
          his name because they can click on the link.]</span> If the document
          mentions "Aunt Jane", thanks to the link, the indexer can add "Jane
          Campbell Tubbs" and "Jane Tubbs" as keywords. The trick is to think
          "if someone wants to find this document, what words need to be added
          in order for <em>FreeFind</em> to find it. Volunteer indexers ask
          themselves, "What search terms would someone looking for this
          document use?" Many of our webpages have been indexed, but most have
          not. Volunteers who index our web pages greatly improve the chances
          of a searcher's success.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Common Errors &amp; Smart Searching
        </h3>
        <p class="FirstP">
          Our webmaster gets reports from <em>FreeFind</em> about the searches
          that are made. Not who was searching, but the search terms used and a
          link to the "hits" found by each search. So we gain some insights
          into what search strategies work and which ones don't work. Of course
          we can't read the searcher's mind and know for sure what he/she had
          in mind. But we can see, and infer, a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>SEARCHING for LIVING PEOPLE.</strong> Except in a few cases,
          such as minutes or programs of recent Campbell Reunions, living
          people aren't mentioned on these web pages. <span class=
          "Annotation">[Our Facebook pages or YouTube pages provide better
          hunting for them.]</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>OR, AND, Phrases.</strong> OR is the default. For instance,
          entering <strong><em>robert lugg</em></strong> in the search box will
          search our site for all pages that contain the word 'Robert'
          <u>or</u> the word 'Lugg'. Which is fine if that's what you intended
          -- but "OR" searches can produce a VERY long hit list. If you wanted
          all the web pages that contained the word 'Robert' and also the word
          'Lugg' you could use the plus sign. E.g. by typing
          <strong><em>+robert +lugg</em></strong> in the search box.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Phrases</strong> are the technique to use if word order
          matters. If you're looking for occurrences the word 'robert'
          immediately followed by the word 'lugg', then type
          <strong><em>"robert lugg"</em></strong> in the search box. But those
          searches look for exact matches -- they wouldn't find occurrences of
          'Robert P. Lugg' or of 'Robert S. Lugg'. Typing <strong><em>"robert
          p. lugg"</em></strong> into the search block would find the former
          and <strong><em>"robert s. lugg"</em></strong> would find the second.
          Or, we could find both in one search by using the wildcard symbol
          <strong><em>?</em></strong>&nbsp; to stand for any character.
          Entering <strong><em>"robert ?. lugg"</em></strong> into the search
          box would find both the 'p' version and the 's' version in one
          search.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ending a search word with a wild card.</strong>
          <em>FreeFind</em> by default finds variations of an English language
          "word root." If you search for 'climb' it will retrieve 'climbs',
          'climbed' and 'climbing'. And if you search for 'Green' it will
          retrieve 'Greene' as well. The <strong>?</strong> wildcard only works
          for a single character in fixed position in a word -- being the nth
          character. So, if you want to search for both 'Seely' and 'Seeley'
          it's no help. But there's a different wild card symbol you use at the
          end of a word that can match any number of characters. Entering
          <strong><em>seel*</em></strong> into the search box will find both
          'Seely' and 'Seeley'.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Practice Makes Perfect
        </h3>
        <p class="FirstP">
          That's a lot to absorb in one setting. But the more searches you do,
          the better you'll become at it.
        </p>
