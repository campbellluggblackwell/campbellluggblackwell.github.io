        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        This April Month with its pressing duties for the Minnesota farmer has
        been, and still is, a busy time in which to work in a period for letter
        writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our seasons this year have been very early and pronounced. Winter came
        upon us last fall about the first of November and lasted until about
        the twentieth of March. There was very little snow, but a very steady
        low temperature, making a rather long but comparatively pleasant winter
        for Minnesota. Then spring came just as suddenly and pronouncedly in
        the month of March. Much plowing was done between March twentieth and
        thirty-first, and some seeding was done also. We have had no snow or
        rain since spring started. Due to this fact and to our light snow fall
        of the winter it is quite dry here, many wells refusing to give forth
        enough water for the owner's stock. But in keeping with that old saying
        that "it is an ill wind that does not blow some good", our roads are in
        fine condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, I must not overlook this opportunity to do a little
        boasting about our northern Minnesota roads. The strides in road
        construction in northern Minnesota during the last ten years have been
        very rapid. This is due to two things; first, the universal reason--the
        use of the automobile; and the second, the fact that we live in the
        very heart of one of the most beautiful lake and summer resort regions
        of the world. We have a well equipped tourist camp ground within the
        city limits of Brainerd, and during the last two summers twenty
        thousand tourists have stayed overnight in the camp ground. This does
        not include those who have stopped at the hotels or camped by the
        roadside or at some lake.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, you can see from this data we do not live in any wilderness.
        Perhaps this information might be an incentive to some of our eastern
        cousins to pay a visit to their Minnesota relatives. We want to assure
        you that you will not have to stay at a camp ground or hotel, but when
        you get to Brainerd, inquire of any kid you meet the way to Hughey's
        farm, and you will find our door open with "meal in the barrel" and
        "oil in the cruse",<sup>1</sup> and we shall enjoy your visit and will
        try and make you enjoy it. We should like to take you out to some of
        our lakes and let you pull out a few

        Our family is pretty well scattered with Brother <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1222">
        Edd</a> at Harper, Washington, <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1204">
        Carrie</a> in Deerwood, Minnesota, and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1244">
        Mary</a> teaching in Minneapolis. This leaves <a href=
        "BixbyHannah1863.html">Mother</a> and I alone on the farm. However, we
        have much to thank the dear Lord for as we have been blessed with good
        health and all of the necessities of life during the past year. We are
        very proud of Sister Carrie's family and Brother Edd's family. We see
        much of Carrie's family as it is only twenty miles to Deerwood.
        <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1207">
        Irma</a>, Carrie's daughter, is in the second year of high school and
        carries many of the high honors of her class. <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1213">
        William</a> is twelve and is finishing the seventh grade. He is all
        boy, and a yard wide. Edd's children are eight and six years of age. Of
        course, we do not see as much of them as they are away out in
        Washington, but we are quite sure they have two of the most brilliant
        children in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for Mary and myself, we are fast approaching our last wonder. For
        Mary's sake I think I shall reserve as a secret what the last wonder
        is--whether it is,"Whom had we better marry?" or "Is there anyone on
        earth who will marry us?" Well, we are not without companionship at any
        rate. Mother loves us both and the Lord loves us, and we all love the
        Lord and belong to Him. Some day He is coming to claim his own. Then we
        shall all gather at the great marriage feast and praise His Name
        forever. Oh, how I hope to meet all of the cousins at the feast (if not
        before)! Since our last letter, I believe three of the cousins have
        been promoted by the Lord to that Last and Glorious Home. How little we
        know who may be next! Only one thing is important then,--are we ready?
      </p>
      <p>
        With kindest regards and best wishes to all of the cousins, I am,
