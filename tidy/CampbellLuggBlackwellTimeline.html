        This gets complicated, so let's review the cast of characters and the timeline.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Around 1776, teenager <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Campbell-25060">John Campbell</a> travels from Scotland to Philadelphia, where he becomes a tailor's apprentice.
        </li>
        <li>Around 1801, the older children of his brother <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Campbell-31750">Joseph</a> (the elder) , who then were living in N. Ireland, travel to, and settle in, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster_County,_Pennsylvania">Lancaster Co., PA</a>.
        </li>
        <li>In 1803. in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avening">Avening</a>, Gloucestershre England. <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Lugg-131">Sarah Lugg</a> marries <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Clinch-347">Thomas Clinch</a>
        </li>
        <li>1804 in Avening, their daughter, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Clinch-346">Ann Clinch</a>, was born. Meanwhile, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol">Bristol</a>, Gloucestershre England, Rev. John Hey<sup>1</sup> begins recruiting English investors to buy a large tract of wilderness in northern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycoming_County,_Pennsylvania">Lycoming Co., PA</a> and move there to farm. They form what becomes known as "The English Company,"<sup>2</sup> to buy more than 10,000 acres, apparently sight unseen. Among those investors is <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-2601">Enoch Blackwell</a> , also of Avening, and many of his Blackwell relatives. Rev. Hey, his family, and Enoch's brother, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-2952">Joshua Blackwell</a>, go to Philadelphia to buy land and make arrangements for the others' migration. Joshua marries Rev. Hey's <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hey-182">daughter</a> .
        </li>
        <li>1805. The group sails from Bristol to Philadelphia. Aboard are Enoch Blackwell, now a widower, his children, many of his siblings and their families. Also aboard are Thomas, Sarah and Ann Clinch. Soon after arriving in America, Thomas Clinch dies,reportedly of yellow fever. Joshua Blackwell settles near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hope,_Pennsylvania">New Hope</a> , Bucks Co., PA. Newly widowed Sarah marries Enoch. Ann is left in the foster care of Joshua &amp; Amelia Blackwell. The rest make the trek to Pine Twp., Lycoming County.
        </li>
        <li>1806. The 10,000 acres the English Company bought is hilly, with thin, stony soil. The immigrants clear land and try to farm, but the farms fail, and their settlements are abandoned<sup>3</sup>. Enoch and Sarah have a daughter, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-2567">Mary Blackwell</a> . Enoch Blackwell decides to harvest the one crop that grows well there, timber -- and prospers as a lumberman.
        </li>
        <li>1810. Joseph Campbell (the elder), his wife and younger children emigrate from N. Ireland to PA. Together with most of the older children in Lancaster Co., and joined by brother John, they buy land in Tioga Co., PA and become founders of what later is called Nelson, PA. Joseph and most of his children clear land and farm. Brother John becomes a miller.
        </li>
        <li>1814 - 1816. <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-2951">Enoch Blackwell, Jr.</a> is born in 1814 and Enoch, Sr. dies in 1816.
        </li>
        <li>1818. We don't know how they met, but John Campbell marries Sarah LUGG Clinch Blackwell. Sarah and her children Mary and Enoch, Jr. move to Nelson where they meet John's nephews, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Campbell-31749">Joseph Campbell</a> (the younger) and his brother, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Campbell-21695">James Campbell</a>.
        </li>
        <li>1821 - 1822. James Campbell and Mary Blackwell want to marry. But presumably face an obstacle, a tradition that a girl wasn't supposed marry before her older sister(s). Sarah wrote to daughter Ann Clinch, who was still living with foster parents, Joshua &amp; Amelia Blackwell, suggesting that Ann marry Joseph Campbell (the younger). Apparently Ann was willing to consider it, because Joseph traveled to her home to meet her. She came back with him and they married in 1822. A week later, Mary Blackwell married James.
        </li>
        <li>1829 - 1833. Sarah's brother, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Lugg-47">Charles Byron Lugg</a> and his family emigrate from Gloucestershire to join Sarah and her PA family, buy a farm, miss England, sell that farm, return to England, but them move back to rejoin Sarah et al.
        </li>
        <li>1865 - 1866. In 1865 Enoch Blackwell, Jr.'s first wife dies, and in 1866 he married his 1st Cousin, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Lugg-133">Caroline Lugg</a>.
        </li>

        1. Rev. Hey is interesting. He was a well know preacher in Bristol. You can see his <a href="https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/31770/rev-john-hey-1734-1815-independent-minister-castle-green-bristol">portrait</a> and read his most famous sermons, <i>Zion's Lamentations</i> and <i>Thoughts on the Peculiarity of This Present War</i> [a Napoleonic War known as "The War of the Second Coalition" which primarily involved the British Navy, but not the British Army] (hardcopy available from Amazon and probably other booksellers). You can read about his time in Bristol on pages 62-64 of Rev. M. Caston's <i><a href="https://zelypigyhi.fdn2018.com/independency-in-bristol-book-3589hb.php">Independency in Bristol</a></i>. And pages <a href="https://www.ebooksread.com9-1884-volume-2-ahc/page-104-history-of-philadelphia-1609-1884-volume-2-ahc.shtml">1289 - 1291</a> of John Thomas Scarf's <i>History of Philadelphia</i> chronicle his adventures there [I found the right pages by making a case sensitive search for "Hey" using CTRL-F9.

        2. See the Pine Township section in <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/pa/county/lycoming/history/Chapter-46.html">Chapter 46</a> of John F. McGinness, <i>1892 History of Lycoming County Pennsylvania</i>. Due to the foibles of oral history, it erroneously speaks of "Haven Parrish" rather than "Avening Parish."

        3. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Township,_Lycoming_County,_Pennsylvania">Pine Township</a> and/or <a href="http://www.joycetice.com/1883/morrhist.htm">Morris Twp.'s history</a>.
