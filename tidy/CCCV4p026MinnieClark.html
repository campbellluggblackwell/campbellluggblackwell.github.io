        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        The time has come to exchange letters again and I hope every one of the
        one hundred will write as I am anxious to see the book. I read every
        letter before I let it alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well today is a nice Spring day sunshine rain and in the house over
        four weeks now mud. There is much sickness here in our small town.
        <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1470">
        Will</a>, has been in the house over four weeks but is better now.
        <a href="TubbsAnn1855.html">Ann</a> is having Grippe<sup>1</sup> but is
        better today; all the rest are better except <a href=
        "SeelyAda1858.html">Cousin Ada</a> she has been a shut-in all winter. I
        was over to see her last week. Will be so glad when she gets
        home.<sup>2</sup><br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it would be a good plan to let some of the Second Cousins have
        the annual Cousins Dinner, don't you? I enjoyed having it, -- not such
        a bad job as some think it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the pictures are very nice, -- will expect the other in the
        book, which will be a great treat to us all.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have not been to Nelson but once since the Cousins Dinner so have not
        seen the Cousins this winter. It has been very cold and lots of
        sickness here. <a href="SelphJennie1873.html">Jennie</a> has not been
        up since the dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well the Spring days make us think of house cleaning time and making
        gardens; we have had some horse radish already this Spring. Well I hope
        some one will ask for the dinner. It would be too bad not to have one;
        we have such good visits together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I do not think of anything more of interest so I will close until
        next time.
