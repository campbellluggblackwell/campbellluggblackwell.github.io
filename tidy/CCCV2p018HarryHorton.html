        Dear Uncles, Aunts and Cousins:

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        To a fellow who has been away from home for thirty years, the
        opportunity to drift back in the fold is one that cannot be overlooked,
        and I was indeed glad to have <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I815">
        Nellie</a> notify me of the wonderful way of keeping in touch with
        those we really love although we know little of their daily life. Of
        course, <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Mother</a>, God bless her, is a
        wonderful correspondent and keeps us posted of the Cousins whom I often
        wonder about, and I shall look forward to the receipt of this book with
        a great deal of pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been located in this little city of Eastern Oregon for eighteen
        years, and have never regretted picking it as a permanent home, even
        though it is rather small and a distance from the metropolis of our
        state. Beautiful snow-capped mountains, lakes, rivers and streams
        abounding in wild life, appeal perhaps more to a Horton than a
        Campbell. Wonderful friendly people who are really our same down
        easterners who were the pioneers of this Northwest. All these help to
        make ones daily life livable; but it is in the home where I believe I
        secure the love and appreciation, the contentedness, which makes one
        know that this little world is a pretty good place after all.

        Helen</a> and I are the same sweethearts of college days back in
        Michigan, with the added bond of three fine children to keep us closer
        together. <a href=

        Virginia Irene</a>, eleven; then came along <a href=

        John Samuel</a>, three, to make us sit up and look at our hole card.
        Jean is the mother of the flock, Virginia is the society belle, and
        John is just a chip off the old block and I believe will make a pretty
        good fisherman as he is already my worm digger and has made good at it.

        Last year we bought a much larger home, only four blocks from my
        office, and we are now enjoying the pleasure of fixing it up as a real
        home. Lots of room to entertain any of the relatives (who never come)
        who should motor through over the old "Oregon Trail" and see the
        Switzerland of America.

        Last year, I believe, <a href=

        Frank</a>, Nellie, <a href=

        Arthur</a> and I were together more than any year since we came West.
        Jean and I attended the State Convention of the Spanish-American War
        veterans<sup>1</sup> in the western part of the state and brought Nell
        and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I820">
        Faith</a><sup>2</sup> back with us for a two week visit. The trip is
        wonderful over the Columbia River Highway, and with a big basket of
        fried chicken, etc., which Nellie certainly knows how to prepare, we
        were like a bunch of children out for a holiday. Four hundred miles
        over wonderful scenic highways with stops, when the spirit moved, to
        drink in the wonders of nature. Then last fall, Frank and Arthur
        breezed along in the old Studabaker hitting on one cylinder and spent
        the week with us. We had just moved and Helen immediately got Frank
        busy with the paint brush and Arthur with the monkey-wrench so they
        were pretty well ready to start for home at the first opportunity. Of
        course both of them are getting short of teeth<sup>3</sup>, and the
        hair just "Ain't" where it ought to be, -- still they are the same boys
        and we were sure glad to see them.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our summers are spent mostly at home and in the mountains, and last
        year we built a very nice cottage at one of our numerous lakes one
        hundred and twenty-five miles from Baker, and are looking forward to
        many happy days there during the warm days of summer. We drive the
        distance in about five hours and fish, loaf and hunt to our hearts
        content. Helen and the children like their pleasures the same as I do,
        which adds much enjoyment to each trip.
      </p>
      <p>
        I just finished up a very successful year as President of the Eastern
        Oregon District Dental Society comprising ten counties of this section
        of the state, and we entertained about fifty of our professional
        brethren with a two days' session here the latter part of February. So
        you see, I do mix a little business with pleasure. I really enjoy my
        profession, and while I work real hard it is interesting and also
        satisfies the better part of one's nature in helping the other fellow.

        We are all members of the Episcopal Church, the children taking an
        active part, and father going when it doesn't interfere with his Sunday
        morning golf. I take more interest in my Masonic work than anything
        else and am at it most of the time. Was recently elected to a chair in
        the Scottish Rite bodies and as we hold two reunions a year and put on
        the work up to the thirty-second degree it means quite a lot of study
        and many evenings away from home.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't start out to write a biography, but it seemed you could see us
        and know us better if you heard just what we were doing with out time,
        and the things we are most interested in. Of course the better way
        would be to come and see us, and I assure you we would make it a royal
        good time.
