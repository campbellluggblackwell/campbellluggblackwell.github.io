        My dear Cousins:-

      <p>
        It is a pity to delay this letter which we all know must be written and
        which we all want very much to write. However, sometimes <span style=
        "text-decoration: underline;">Home</span> <span style=
        "text-decoration: underline;">Duties</span> crowd out the pleasures,
        and such has been my experience this time, but I will plunge right into
        Cousin affairs at once, and try to make this a real family letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been some years since <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1051">
        Al</a> and I had had a vacation trip and last August we took advantage
        of an opportunity which was offered to us.o Boston, Mass. Leaving here
        on the twenty-third of the month, we went t via Baltimore, Md.,
        Reading, Pa., Yonkers, N.Y. and Providence, R.I., visiting friends and
        points of interest en route. We spent some very pleasant days with
        friends in Boston and came back to Pittsfield, Mass., where we were
        delightfully entertained at the home of Cousin <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I981">
        Emily Blanchard</a> and her fine family. Emily took us to visit
        Williams College, which was all new to us and very entertaining. She
        proved herself to be a splendid driver also.
      </p>
      <p>
        After leaving these Cousins, we drove West across our grand old New
        York state to the border, where we spent some visiting the Thousand
        Islands and other interesting features. We then came South through New
        York state to our native Pennsylvania home. As we were anticipating a
        trip North again to attend the Cousins Dinner, we did see many of the
        Cousins at that time. We did stop at Nelson long enough to see Aunt
        <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Anna Owlett</a> and some of her family,
        Aunt <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1057">
        Laura Maurie</a>, Cousins <a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">Mark</a> and
        <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I973">
        Sue Seely</a> and <a href="SeelyLena1873.html">Lena Goodrich</a> and
        also had a nice chat with <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1608">
        Alta Cady</a>. Then we stole out for a ride for an hour and found
        Cousins <a href="SeelyAda1858.html">Ada Crandall</a>, <a href=
        "SeelyJud1851.html">Jud</a> and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I660">
        Mary Seely</a>, <a href="TubbsAnn1855.html">Ann Van Dusen</a> and
        <a href="GoodrichFrances1871.html">Frank Hoyt</a>. Our time was getting
        short, and we left Nelson with only a few days ahead in which to make
        some short visits to friends in Elmira, and then to enjoy the last leg
        of our lovely trip visiting Harrisburg and Gettysburg, Pa. After nearly
        four weeks from home and family, we came back to Washington without
        mishap, with a pleasant memory which we will never forget.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the past year some of the Cousins have paid us a visit. Cousin
        <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">George Buck</a> spent two days and two
        nights with us and although it was a business trip we managed to do a
        lot of good visiting, and he did himself proud in entertaining the
        family at dinner one evening, which we enjoyed fully. On other
        occasions he has called us on the telephone when passing through, as
        have Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charles Congdon</a> and
        Cousin <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">Mary Shipman</a>.<sup>1</sup>

        a local call was practical.

        In December it was our pleasure to have with us for a week Cousin
        <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1605">
        Doris Selph</a> Drake and her splendid husband <a href=

        Philip</a>. We had never met Phil before and were not very well
        acquainted with Doris, but we soon found that entertaining a bride and
        groom of the Campbell Clan is a real treat.

        <a href="BosardFlorence1887.html">Florence</a> has told you of our
        wonderful five day trip to Osceola on October twentieth to attend the
        Cousins Dinner so I will not go into that pleasure further, excepting
        to say that while it was our first, I hope it is not our last
        appearance at that annual event.
