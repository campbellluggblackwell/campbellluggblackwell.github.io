        Friends and Kinsmen, I am interested in the history of our family. I
        try each year to add a chapter to what I have already written.
      </p>
      <p>
        It ought not to be difficult to collect the history of our family in
        America. Comparatively speaking, as an American cafamily, we are of
        recent origin. I am the grand-daughter of the <a href=
        "CampbellJoseph1748.html">immigrant ancestor</a>. It is but ninety one
        years since the immigrant ancestor set foot on these
        shores<sup>1</sup>. A single life might span the whole period. And yet
        in this comparatively brief time much has been lost. Some have not kept
        records of their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our lot as a family has been cast in Pennsylvania where our public
        records were kept. Until recently some have had no concern about items
        of family interest and are indifferent when appealed to. I take a
        commendable pride in our history as a family. It is my mission on this
        occasion to arouse in others some of the interest I feel myself, to
        instill into the bosoms of others a modicum of that pride of family
        which induces us to make journeys, write letters, collect facts and
        compile articles year after year that a compact and complete history of
        our people in America may be the result.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have heretofore given a sketch of the Campbells who lived and died in
        Tioga County, Pennsylvania. What I have to say today will not concern
        them to any extent but in order to make what I have to say clear and
        intelligible I will preface my paper with a brief review lesson. I hope
        it will make what I do say more plain and more easy to be understood.
      </p>

        Joseph Campbell was our immigrant ancestor. He was born in 1748 and
        died in 1824. He married <a href="HarperMary1749.html">Mary Harper</a>
        who was born in 1749 and died in 1844. These were my grandparents. They
        kept a family record which is in existence. According to this record
        Joseph and Mary were the parents of eight children as follows:

        (including her father) arrived in 1810. However, the older of her aunts
        and uncles, and her great-uncle, John Campbell, had come earlier. -

        Of this family, Sarah who married Samuel Hazlett, Elizabeth who married
        Richard Ellison, Jane who married John Hazlett, Joseph who married Ann
        Clinch, and James who married Mary Blackwell, spent their natural years

        What I have calculated for this occasion, though short, concerns those
        descendants of my grandfather Campbell who did not come to this country
        [typo, should be 'county']. I have told you that Joseph Campbell landed
        in New York City and from there he went to Lancaster Co., Pa. where he
        spent a few years with his family. While in Lancaster his daughter
        <a href="CampbellMary1779.html">Mary</a> married <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I12">
        John Hazlett</a> and his son <a href="CampbellJohn1781.html">John</a>
        married <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I13">
        Elizabeth Bell</a>. These two children never came to Tioga County to
        live<sup>3</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to tell you something about these two families whom most of us
        have never seen. It is not much I have been able to gather. Such as I
        have is as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        John Campbell, born March 15, 1781, married Elizabeth Bell in Lancaster
        County, Pa. Shortly after they were married they moved to Pittsburgh,
        Pa.<sup>4</sup> where they purchased a large tract of land, reared
        their family of eleven children, lived, and died. John Campbell died
        March 18, 1866, aged eighty-six years, eleven months, twenty-nine days.
        His wife Elizabeth died January 15, 1860 aged seventy-four years, five
        months, eight days. He was a farmer, in politics a Democrat, in
        religious belief and practice a <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenanter">Covenanter</a>. It is said of
        him that he was very zealous in his religion and often entertained the
        minister and elders of the denomination to which he belonged.
      </p>
      <p>
        The eleven children of this worthy couple are as follows:<br>

        2. James was born in North Ireland; his siblings were either born there
        or in Scotland. All had lived in N. Ireland before coming to the US.
        Sarah and Elizabeth, at least, lived in Lancaster Co., PA for a few
        years before coming to Tioga Co.Joseph, Ann, James &amp; Mary were
        buried in the Nelson Cem., and their graves are undisturbed and well
        maintained. The other mentioned in this paragraph were buried in the
        family plot on the land Sam Hazlett bought from Daniel Strait, became
        John Hazlett's farm, his daughter Eliza Merritt's, and when Vol. 4 was
        published, Merritts still lived in that farm house, owned the land, and
        farmed it. The burial plot was near the house, on a knoll overlooking
        Baxter Creek, East of the Nelson Cemetery. But as part of the
        Cowanesque Lake Project, the remains were exhumed and reintered in the
        NW corner of the Nelson Cem. Most of the stones were broken and
        therefore laid flat, and grass tends to grow over them - wbt.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. The elder Joseph Campbell, with his wife and younger children landed
        in Perth Amboy, NJ, very close to NYC. But if Jane is correct that they
        arrived in 1810, then they didn't have time to live in Lancaster Co.
        because his diary makes it clear that they landed in early October. It
        says they went from Perth Amboy to Sam Hazlett's farm near "Alcorea",
        wherever that was (presumably near Stroudsburg, PA). Shortly after
        arriving at Sam's, those going to Tioga Co. set out on their migration,
        arriving at Beecher's Island either on New Years Eve of 1810 or New
        Years Day of 1811. We know that the older children definitely lived in
        Lancaster Co. Sally's 1st child was born there in 1803. Mary Campbell
        Hazlett died there. I have seen no evidence that Joseph, Sr. and his
        younger children ever lived in Lancaster Co. But if they did, then Jane
        and Joseph W. Buck interpreted the diary wrong and Joseph, Sr.'s boat
        landed years before 1810. Personally, I think their ship did land in
        1810 - wbt.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. At the time John Campbell bought his farm, and when his
        brother-in-law, John Hazlett [husband of Mary Campbell] bought a nearby
        one, the properties were North of Pittsburgh. Later they became
        incorporated as Allegheny City, and are now part of Pittsburgh's North
        side.

        I cannot tell you as much as I wish I could about these Cousins of the
        daughters. <a href=

        Jane</a> each married a man by the name of Sloan and the others either
        died young or remained unmarried. Of the sons I have no account of
        their marriages, which I regret. John Campbell, however, has eleven
        living grandchildren, one of whom is a practicing physician in Chicago.
        Samuel had four daughters; Mary Ann Sloan had two sons and one
        daughter, and Jane Sloan had two sons.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is my account of John Campbell, brother of my father and the
        family. Mary Campbell was born March 19, 1779, married John Hazlett,
        lived, and died in Lancaster Co., Pa. John Hazlett, her husband, was in
        partnership with a Mr. Swartz. They owned and operated a large lead
        works.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been unable to obtain the date of the marriage of Mary Campbell.
        I am informed that she died between the years 1823 and 1828 aged
        between forty and fifty years<sup>5</sup>. She is buried in Lancaster
        Co., Pa., but the exact place I have not learned. She was the mother of
        eight children:<br>

        I am informed her children are now dead. After the death of their
        mother this family moved to Allegheny County. They were neighbors of
        their Cousins, the children of John Campbell in the vicinity of
        Pittsburgh. The meager amount I have been able to learn about them
        suggests much to be done in collecting a full record. Sufficient
        perseverance will accomplish it. I hope to stir up the necessary
        enthusiasm at this family gathering to keep the work going.
      </p>
      <p>
        This family reunion is a pleasant and social occasion to meet and greet
        each other and to brighten the chains of friendship. We recognize the
        tie of kindred in this connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to call your attention to a duty which I feel is incumbent upon
        us. I have recently visited the burial plot where Joseph Campbell, Sr.,

        The little plot of ground so sacred to the Campbell Clan in America is
        situated on the farm of <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I730">
        C.F. Merritt</a>, in Nelson borough. It is square in shape, being about
        six rods<sup>8</sup> on each of its four sides. I will try to tell you
        how this burial ground looked at the time of a recent visit. In one
        corner stood an ancient apple tree. It had produced many scrubby
        sprouts, which spread over a large part of the ground, from two to six
        feet high. These were interspersed with raspberry and blackberry
        bushes, with thorn plum tree sprouts, elderberry bushes, burdock, and
        goldenrod. There was also a hedge of uncared for snowball, rose and
        lilac bushes and all of it overrun with some kind of wild ivy. This
        place is a veritable tangle and he who would read the inscriptions on
        the tombs must go about with axe and scythe. This place is so sacred to
        every one of us, in whose veins flows the blood of Joseph Campbell, is
        crowded hard on all sides by the barn-yard and driveway, of the old
        homestead on which it is situated. The fact that three or four of the
        valuable tombstones are broken into two pieces would indicate that it
        had been occupied perhaps by livestock. On the easterly side for a
        distance of three or four rods is no fence at all. This is along the
        driveway. On the West side the top boards are gone. All the fence now
        standing is old and dilapidated.
      </p>

        In one particular I wish to give this annual reunion a practical turn
        under the blessing of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the descendants of Joseph Campbell, Sr. have been endowed with
        worldly wealth and lots of us have strong hands and willing hearts. I
        suggest we do not turn our faces homeward from this gathering until we
        have provided the means and devised a plan to clean up this naturally
        beautiful plot of ground and surround it with a substantial
        fence.<sup>9</sup>

        9. Minutes of subsequent reunions show they did raise funds for new
        fences and work parties restored the burial ground, at least for a
        while. The Merritt family sold this farm to a Mr. Paul Bennett and the
        grave yard became know as "The Paul Bennett Cemetery" -- at least
        that's how the Army Engineers designated it when they bought the
        property and relocated the remains. (They also relocated some graves
        from the S.E. corner of the Nelson Cem., a section that I always
        regarded as the prettiest. It's beautiful spruce trees are long gone.).
