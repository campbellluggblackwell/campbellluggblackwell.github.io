      <p>
        In an early time, perhaps 1840. I can remember when my <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">father</a> drove wolves away from the sheepfold with a pole. Soon after this a panther followed my&nbsp;<a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">mother</a> along the butter-milk run-road screaming a [sic] intervals, scareing [sic] her nearly to death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later my brother <a href="CampbellWilliam1822.html">Wm.</a> killed a large snake on fathers farm measuring 12 feet &amp; having 4 legs. I can also remember when we had to go to the neighbors for fire brands &amp; carry it between two barks. matches not being so plentiful as they are now. Our cooking was all done over the fire place. using iron bake kettle &amp; tin oven.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was the last one born on the old log house on the flat.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can still remember when Sister <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">Phebe</a> fell down the cellar-stairs &amp; broke her jaw. but she can talk as good as ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        We used to watch the bars to keep the cattle from going from one field to another when father was having [haying?] or any teaming instead of closing them each time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="HarperMary1749.html">Grandmother Campbell</a> used to wade the river bare-footed with the children. She was 97 when she died.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mrs. George Tubbs
