        The twenty-eighth annual Re-union of the Campbell Family was held at
        Nelson Thurs. Aug 26, 1920. (It was proven to us by <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1057">
        Laura Mourie</a> at this meeting that the first one was held in 1892
        instead of '93)<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The day was fine and sixty-five members assembled to greet each other
        and renew acquaintances Because of the convenience of tables and seats
        and dishes the dinner was held in the Grange Hall after which the
        Program was given in the I. O. O. F. Hall that we might have the use of
        Piano.

        Jessie Campbell</a> Ellison twenty-five years ago for a similar
        occasion but not read at that time. As the writers are both no longer

        Mrs. M. B. Seely</a> recited some original verses she had written for
        the Re-union of six years ago but was unavoidably prevented from

        The Sec. was instructed to write letters of sympathy to Mrs. Mary Beers
        and Mr. and <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">Mrs. Geo. Shipman</a>

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. All the records I have seen state 1893 was the first. Such as
        <a href="ReunionMinutes1893.html">1893 minutes</a>, <a href=
        "ReunionMinutes1894.html">1894 minutes</a>, and <a href=
        "ReunionProgram1894.html">1894 invitation</a>. I don't know why Laura
        BOSARD Mourey became convinced the first Campbell Reunion was in
        1892.&nbsp; -wbt.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel SHIPMAN</a> Shaw wrote the
        words for that song.
