        On Friday the Campbell Cousins met at the home of <a href=
        "SeelyAda1858.html">Ada Crandall</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day being cold and stormy there [was] not a very large crowd out.
        but enough to have a good time as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a Sumptious chicken Pie dinner was served there was toasts, short
        speeches, stories told and a general good visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then came the business meeting and the Election of Officers. it was
        moved and carried that whoever entertained the Cousins should act as
        President. Then the question arose what shall we call our society.
        after several names had been proposed Cousin <a href=
        "CongdonCharles1856.html">C H Congdon</a> came to the rescue and said
        call it the <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph Campbell</a>
        Cousins.<sup>1</sup> then moved and carried that we, by request, hold
        the next meeting at the home of our Cousin <a href=
        "CampbellThomas1856.html">T C Campbell</a> in Knoxville. the Host &
        Hostess state the appointed time
      </p>
      <p>
        then came the good by until we meet again.
      </p>
      <p>
        all voting a good time and Cousin Ada rite [sic] royal Entertainer.

      Cousins Reunions ran from 1893 to 1942, and were open to the public, but

      & <a href="HarperMary1749.html">Mary Harper</a> Campbell, associated Lugg
      and Blackwell families, and friends. Attendance was sometimes several
      hundred. The Cousins Dinners started in 1909 and were by invitation only.
      They were primarily for the grandchildren of <a href=

        <em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1. Naming them group
        after their grandfather may have seemed an obvious choice to those
        present. But it later led to confusion because there were 3 generations
        of Joseph Campbells --- their grandfather, his father <a href=
        "CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph Campbell</a>, and their uncle,
        <a href="CampbellJoseph1839.html">Joseph D. Campbell</a>.</span></em>
