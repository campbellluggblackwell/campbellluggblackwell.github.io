        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NELSON, Oct. 9.---Benjamin D. Congdon was born
        on Shelter Island, off the coast of Long Island, N. Y., May 18, 1820,
        and moved with his patents to the Cowanesque valley, settling near
        Osceola, in 1832. He was married January 19th, 1848, to Miss <a href=
        "CampbellSarah1824.html">Sarah Campbell</a>. His wife died Feb. 3d,
        1892. He died September 27th, 1897, aged 77 years, 4 months, and 14
        days. He is survived by one daughter and two sons---Mrs. J. L. Buck, of
        Sugar Hill, N. Y., Mr. E.T. Congdon, of Tacoma, Wash., and C. H.
        Congdon, of St. Paul, Minn.</big>

    </div><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He resided in Nelson for sixty years, until
    the death of his wife, after which he made his home with his daughter, Mrs.
    Buck. He visited his friends and relatives in Nelson last June, and then he
    started on a journey to the Pacific coast. He arrived in St. Paul on June
    18th and was taken sick at the home of his son, C. H. Congdon, Sept 12th.
    He was removed at once to St. Luke's Hospital, where an operation was
    performed for a strangulated hernia. The operation was successful; but
    fifteen days later he suddenly and unexpectedly died from heart failure.
    Mrs. Buck went to St. Paul and was with her father for a week before he
    died. C. [sic] T. Congdon came from Tacoma, and the three children
    accompanied the remains to Nelson.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Congdon united with the Presbyterian Church in
    Nelson, February 1st 1845 and lived the consistent and every day life of a
    Christian for nearly fifty three years.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Sunday morning, October 3rd his three children and a
    large congregation of relatives and friends followed his remains to the
    grave and tenderly and lovingly by the side of his wife, father and mother.
    Rev. Hallock Armstrong spoke words of comfort from the text "Eye hath not
    seen, nor ear heard nor have entered into the heart of man the things that
    God hath prepared for him that love Him."<br>
