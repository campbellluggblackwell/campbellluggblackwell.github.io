        When you visit the Documents Index you see a long list of documents,
        grouped by type: letters, news clips, photo albums, etc. Toward the
        bottom are two of most important sections: "Presentations and
        Tutorials" and "Misc. Others." I recommend all of the items circled in
        red.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        The presentations, given at other reunions, will be joined by this one.
        And soon by a series of tutorials.
      </p>
      <p>
        The booklet I picked up at Avening's Holy Cross Church, is fascinating.
        This place, where Sarah Lugg was first married and where Ann Clinch was
        baptized, was built by Queen Matilda, the wife of William the
        Conqueror.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many Blackwells will be intrigued by the will of Enoch's father, John
        Blackwell.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two <em>In Memorium</em>s are Jane (Campbell) Tubbs' tributes to
        her parents, Joseph and Ann Clinch Campbell, filled with glimpses of
        pioner life when livestock (and children) had to be protected from
        wolves, cougars and bears.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two brief <em>Reminiscences</em> are the memories Jane and her
        sister, Phebe (Campbell)Hoyt had of growing up in pioneer PA, what
        schooling was like and what the women had to do to work the farms while
        the men were away fighting to preserve the Union.

        Our cemetery pages are important to those interested in visiting
        cemeteries. All known burials of members of our family are
        included.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Those planning to visit a particular cemetery may find it useful to be
        able to see all of the Campbell-Lugg-Blackwell burials in that
        cemetery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those traveling may be interested in finding out if there areies along
        their route (or where they are staying) that have burials of family
        members.
      </p>
      <p>
        This cemetery index is organized by state and country. Where there are
        many burials, it's broken down by county, or even by township.

        We're about halfway through moving our family tree to a website hosing
        a single, world-wide tree. As you can see, it contains a lot of dead
        people and is maintained by a lot or living people. Anyone on the
        Internet can view this tree for free - no subscription is required.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each person in the tree has their own web page. In addition to the info
        about them, there is access to diagrams of their ancestors or
        descendants, reports, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        You're looking at a a search screen. To search for someone, put enter

        For those of you who know Nelson, it's hard to see in this photo, but
        just past the RR station, coming in from the left is Pease Hill Rd. And
        if the photographer had eyes in the back of his head, he'd be looking
        up Baxter Lake Rd.

        Anyone on Facebook can view this group page, Campbell, Lugg or
        Blackwell descendants are encouraged to join and to "Write Post"s or
        post photos or videos (circled in green). And to "Like" or respectfully
        comment on other's posts.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you look at the items circled in red you can view a list of the 200+

      <p>
        At the very bottom of the slide, circled in red, you'll see a link to
        another FB group that may be of interest, <em>A History of the Nelson
        area</em>. Many are members of both groups. I see this group's focus
        being on our Campbell, Lugg and/or Blackwell cousins; and their having
        more focus on nostalgia.
