          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will take off my hat to <a href=
          "SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> for rounding up the Campbells.
          No one but a successful life insurance man, with that persistent
          follow‑up policy, would have the nerve to attempt it, and I want to
          congratulate him on his wonderful success which the first installment
          has proven.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is difficult for you Cousins who are
          permitted to see each other often, to appreciate what these letters
          mean to those of us who left the old home years ago to make a new one
          among strangers, and seldom given an opportunity to talk over
          incidents of our early days,‑ but I want to say frankly
          that</font></font></font>

          <font face="Courier, monospace"><font size="4">your letters have done
          more to bring back to me my early surroundings than any thing else
          could possibly have done,‑ and as I read each letter it renewed in my
          memory many pleasant incidents never to be forgotten.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I regret more than I can tell not having
          been able to attend the Cousins' Re‑union at <a href=

          reunion, which was for all branches of our Campbells, plus Luggs &
          Blackwells, was held in Nelson that year, as usual. The event Mabel
          hosted in Mansfield was a "Cousins Dinner" - for Will's 1st cousins
          only (and their invited guests)-wbt</small>]</span> Louise and I had
          thought we might motor taking Bill with us that far on his way to
          school, but as the time passed we were obliged to give it up;
          however, we did go as far as Chicago with him, returning the next
          day; he is attending a boys' school at Deerfield, Mass.,‑ the
          Deerfield Academy,‑ his first year away from home; he writes that the
          country is beautiful there, and that he likes the school, but admits
          that the fellow who wrote "There's no place like home”, knew what he
          was talking about.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our family are all in the best of health,
          and we have enjoyed a very pleasant summer.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know a good joke on <a href=
          "CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a> and must tell you. I get one
          letter from him each year, most always, but now under this system he
          will have to come through with three. More power to you Will.<br>
