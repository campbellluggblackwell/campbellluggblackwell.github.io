      [A letter from 19 year old Mabel Mary Essex in Gloucestershire, to 14
      year old Inez Hoyt (later Inez Boller), daughter of Mabel's 2nd cousin,
      <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">Phoebe CAMPBELL</a> Hoyt. Mabel and Inez
      never met, but when I was a teenager I got to meet and know one of
      Mabel's brothers, the Rev. Cannon <a href=
      "http://wc.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I154">
      Edward Claude Essex</a>, who often spoke of Mabel. I did eventually get
      to visit the Stroud Valley, but not the villages of Minchinhampton or
      Stroud.I inherited the handwritten original, because Inez raised my
      mother (who was her niece and heir). - wbt]

        &nbsp;My Dear Cousin,

      <p>
        I am taking a great liberty in writing to you, but hope you will not be
        offended, we were all so very pleased to receive a letter from you, &
        dear <a href="HoytInez1871.html">Miss Hoyt</a> I wish we were near each
        other to enjoy ourselves together. I have but one female cousin of the
        same age as myself, & I do not see her very often; so I thought I would
        make bold & write to you. I hope you do not get so much wet in your
        country as we get here for it seems as if we are always having rain,
        but I suppose we must not complain, but suppose it is sent for some
        wise purpose. My brother has shown me the letter & I hope you possess
        good eyes, if not you had better borrow someone's eye glasses to aid
        you I hear from my <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I130">
        father</a> that you have but one brother so you cannot realize what I
        have to under go, I have five & I only wish you could hear the noise
        they make sometimes, enough to send one distracted.

        Mother</a> is gone to London a week or two, so I have to stand in her
        place. I am very sure you will set me down as a very sour customer, but
        they tell me I am older in ways, than in years, so you must overlook
        this, knowing the cause thereof. I hope you will soon give us the
        pleasure of seeing your photograph, we admire <a href=

        Cousin Grace</a>'s very much. I think the Nelson People are better
        artists than our <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroud">Stroud</a> folks are. I am
        afraid that I shall tire you with all this epistle, & it is time for me
        to retire. I will close this with the fondest love to yourself &
        dearest, Miss Hoyt & my kindest regards to Mr. Hoyt.<sup>1</sup>
