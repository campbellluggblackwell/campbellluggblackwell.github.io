    <h2>"CAMPBELL COUSINS CORRESPONDENCE CLUB COMMENTS"</h2>
    <h3>- By the Secretary -</h3>
    <h3>* * * * *</h3>
    <h4>VOLUME NO. I COMPLETE</h4>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> When you receive this Report, it will complete Volume No. I of our
        Campbell Cousins Correspondence, representing our two exchanges of
        letters for the year 1923. Volume No. 2 will be about the same size of
        binder and will contain the two exchanges of letters for the year 1924.<sup>1</sup></p>
    </div>
    <h4>LETTERS</h4>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> I want to congratulate and complement every one of the Cousins for the
        fine letters they have written. Each one seems to have done their very
        best and what a pleasure we shall have during the coming winter season
        in reading and re-reading these letters. I want to add also that the
        second Cousins<sup>2</sup> have certainly contributed their full share
        to this Correspondence Club, and as time goes on I am sure that their
        letters will far outshine those of the first Cousins<sup>3</sup>, thus
        guaranteeing the success of our plan. I see no reason why the Club
        cannot be increased from time to time, especially where there are now
        third, fourth, and fifth Cousins in the same home. This need not
        necessitate an extra folio as both mother, child, and grandchild could
        use the same book. For example, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1244">Mary
          Hughey</a> has written a lovely letter but will share her <a href="BixbyHannah1863.html">mother</a>'s
        book; my own daughter, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1605">Doris</a>,
        has also contributed a letter and will share in our book. Therefore, if
        this plan can be worked out in any of the Cousin's <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>
        families, I hope you will report the fact to me before our next Report
        so that I may plan accordingly. For example, we would very like much if
        letters could be contributed by <a href="SeelyLena1873.html">Lena
          Goodrich</a>, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I780">
          Helen Wilson</a>, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I828">Arthur
          Horton</a>, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1055">Florence
          Bosard</a>, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I916">William
          C. Campbell, Jr.</a>,-- and a number of others whose names might be
        mentioned. Will you not give careful thought to this matter and
        co-operate as much as possible?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>1. Volume 1 was in a ring binder and contained two rounds of letters.
        Vol. 2 - 4&nbsp; only contained one exchange of letters because many of
        the Cousins only wanted to write one per year. Vol. 2 was in a spring
        binder. Vols. 3 &amp; 4 were hard bound.</p>

    <h4>PHOTOGRAPHS</h4>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>The photographs are simply fine and still afford a rare treat to you
        all. I should have been a little more specific in my suggestions
        regarding photographs. What I really wanted was to have photographs
        which would include the entire family, as in this way all the references
        could be made back and forth from one letter to another, and all of our
        pictures would have appeared. I want to call special attention to the
        fine groups of pictures as follows, all of which were taken at close
        range and show up very nicely indeed: </p>

        George Buck family;- page <a href="CCCV1R2p58VirginiaProtzmanEllison.html">58</a>,
        Hugh Ellison family.- Several of the Cousins have promised t have better
        pictures for our next Report. Although we shall not make a special
        feature of photographs in our April Report, may I suggest that in each
        case where a full group picture has not been furnished that you see to
        it that one is taken during the winter and that fifty prints are sent
        along so that they may be included in our next Report. We want to have
        complete groups in each case as far as possible. </p>
    </div>
    <h4>REPORT FOR APRIL 15, 1924</h4>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>In addition to the missing pictures which are to come in for the April
        Report, I want to make a special feature of the genealogy of the first
        Cousins or third generation. Our Report No. 1 contained a few pages
        giving the genealogy of the first and second generations complete, and
        we must now put down in order the record of the next generation. In the
        early part of January, I shall mail to each of the first Cousins or
        their representatives a carefully prepared chart which should be filled
        out with great care and returned to me for compilation purposes. There
        were but thirty of the first Cousins as you will note by referring to
        page 3 of Report No. 1. The information to be placed on the chart will
        be something as follows: Full name,- date of birth,- place of birth,- if
        married, then date of marriage,- and name of and exact date of birth of
        person married,- together with place of birth, in case of death of a
        first Cousin give exact date and place of death;- in case of more than
        one marriage, then exact data to cover this point. In some cases it may
        be necessary to refer very carefully to family Bibles, etc., but this <span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be</span>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">done</span> in a very strict
        manner if our Report is to be complete and authentic. When these charts
        have been returned to me, I shall then be able to work up for you all
        some careful statistics which will completely cover</p>

    the third generation of the Joseph Campbell Family. I shall write the first
    Cousins early in 1924 a little more fully on this matter.

    <h4>REPORT BY STATES</h4>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> I thought it would be interesting to show this page (Page "<a href="CCCV1R2pAA.html">AA</a>")
        so that you might observe how widely scattered our relatives really are.
        The state of Pennsylvania (good old State) stands there with eighteen
        reports or 100% perfect. This certainly is fine inasmuch as she is
        contributing more than one third of the letters for this report.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>RETURN POST CARD</h4>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> In order to insure prompt delivery, this Report is sent to you by
        first class mail and should be received by you without delay.
        Considerable delay was experienced in the delivery of the June Reports
        as they were sent by Parcel Post and Insured. In order that I may know
        that you have received your Report, will you please be good enough to
        date, sign and return to me the post card which you will find at the top
        of this Report?</p>
    </div>
    <h4>DELINQUENTS</h4>
    <div class="Message">Your Secretary was extremely anxious that this
      Photographic Number should be 100% complete both as to letters and
      photographs. With this end in view, I have been very persistent in writing
      a few of the Cousins who must have overlooked our numerous requests and
      have purposely helt the report open an extra week in order that none
      should be left out whose letters and photographs could possibly be
      included. We were especially anxious to include letters and photos of
      Cousins <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1477">
        Carrie Campbell</a>, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1222">
        Ed Hughey</a>, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I947">
        Lee Congdon</a> and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1478">
        Harry Campbell</a>, who we understand is still over in France.<sup>4</sup>
      How nice it would have been if these missing letters and photos could have
      been included! These particular members of our Club will have to do as <a
        href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie Congdon</a> did by writing a nice
      newsy letter for our Report next April. However, a total of forty-eight
      reports from a club of fifty-two is a mighty good showing and again I feel
      like congratulating the entire Clan on its hearty co-operation. </div>
    <h4>ORGANIZATION</h4>
    <div class="Message">Before our next Report, I hope to have our
      Correspondence Club regularly organized with a President, Vice-President,
      Secretary and Treasurer so that from now on the responsibility and work of
      getting out these reports may be divided.</div>

      <p>Within another week or two, I shall figure out what it has cost to get
        out Volume Number One complete and will send you a memorandum covering
        your share. A little fund has already been created to care of a few of
        our Cousins who might feel that the yearly cost of these Reports was
        somewhat of a burden. If, therefore, you receive no bill from the
        Secretary, you will understand that your share of the expense has
        already been taken care of.</p>
