      <p>Dear Cousins:-</p>

      <p> What a pleasure it is going to be to have my visit with you all while
        sitting in the car on this glorious sunshiny afternoon. I am waiting for
        <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1566">
          Mr. Carey</a> to finish his business at the Union Structural Steel
        Plant.<br>
      </p>
      <p> We came to Syracuse this morning from Elmira, a distance of ninety-two
        miles. With our good New York State roads it makes a very enjoyable
        trip. The hill sides are still gorgeous with autumn coloring, and as we
        went over the hills and through the valleys it all seemed so wonderful
        that I felt thankful to&nbsp; be living.</p>
      <p>I think that you all know that on January 6, 1920, I married my next
        door neighbor. He has one son, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1567">John
          B. Jr.</a>, who lives with his <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I13638">
          grandmother</a>.</p>
      <p>We have spent a greater part of the time in Pittsburgh, Pa., and the
        past year in Buffalo where Mr. Carey is located. Just at present we have
        opened up our home at 439 West Clinton Street, Elmira, and will be here
        until after Christmas. </p>
