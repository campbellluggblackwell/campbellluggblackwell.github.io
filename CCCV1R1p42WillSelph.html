                are you all? The idea of the "Campbell Cousins
                Correspondence" seems to be a good one and if carried
                out, will, I am sure, fill a long&#8209;felt want. The
                combined reports coming in every three months will
                contain a wealth of information as to names, dates,
                history, current events, etc., etc., which we would not
                otherwise have and we must all co&#8209;operate with our
                secretary, whoever he or she may be, to the fullest
                extent. To think of writing one letter and getting
                twenty&#8209;five or thirty letters in reply and, from just
                the very ones who are so near and dear to us, is
                certainly wonderful,&#8209; and I for one am glad the scheme
                has been inaugurated and will promise right now to do my
                full share toward making the project a complete and
                permanent success. <br>

            <p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2;
              orphans: 2;"><font size="4">As the Secretary for the time
                being, I, of course, have a slight advantage over the
                other Cousins in being able to see the letters first and
                combine them for our permanent record, and you cannot
                imagine hoes much real genuine pleasure has come to me
                in this matter. <br>

                letter of comment and suggestions on other sheets so

                history. </font> </p>

                reports, we will try and dig a little deeper into
                genealogy and family history, but will skip all this for
                the present report and simply tell you that I came to
                New York City on April 30, 1892,&#8209; a little over
                thirty&#8209;one years ago and have been in business here ever
                since. For the past fifteen years, I have been
                identified with the oldest Life Insurance Company in the
                country,&#8209; The New England Mutual Life Insurance Company
                of Boston. I believe the selling of Life Insurance is
                one of the most laudable professions a man can be
                engaged in and that we are doing almost as much good as
                the ministers of the Gospel. The ministers are looking
                out for the spiritual welfare of folks, whereas we
                Insurance Agents are providing for the widows and
                orphans after the breadwinner has been called home.<br>

                have been in New York I have made a number of trips back
                to dear old Tioga County but have not gone every year,
                and have therefore missed seeing my own relatives as
                often as I should like. From now on however, we are
                going to try to visit the Tioga County folks at least
                once a year; in fact we are just now planning to leave
                New York about July 18th and be in </font> </p>
