        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        It seems so short a time since we wrote our Cousins letters in 1925
        that I hardly know what to write, so many things have happened all
        around us. In our home town there have been a number of deaths and at
        present many are sick.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yesterday at the Bulkley farm, above town, a man was crossing the river
        with a load of milk -- the water was high and man and team were
        drowned; the man has not been found yet today; the team and wagon were
        carried nearly a mile down stream.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I went to Wellsboro a few days ago to see sister <a href=
        "SeelyAda1858.html">Ada Crandall</a>, who is with her son, <span wc_id=
        "I453">Mahlon</span>, this winter; she went there last December and has
        not been able to go out on the street since; has been under the
        doctor's care most of the time; gains very slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I660">Mary</span> and I are well as usual and able to eat
        our rations and this reminds me that it is dinner time and I will have
        to get my own dinner for Mary has gone out to a tureen dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        All these things remind me that while we are in life, we are in the
        midst of death. "Be ye also ready, etc."
      </p>
      <p>
        With love and best wishes to you all,
      </p>
