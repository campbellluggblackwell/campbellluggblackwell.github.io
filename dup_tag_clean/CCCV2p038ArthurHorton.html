        Dear Cousins All:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        In the rush of everyday affairs, it is very easy to get our of touch
        with relatives, of whom they have not seen or heard for a number of
        years, so it was with great pleasure that I read and enjoyed the past
        numbers of the Cousins Correspondence Book. It brought back so vividly
        many of the happy times which we youngsters had at our Annual Campbell
        R-unions, that I can picture the "heaps of pies and ice cream" that
        were always loaded on those tables.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> has asked that I
        tell a few personal items of interest, about myself and family; this is
        a bit hard to do, for one who does nothing extraordinary, and is only
        one of the regular run of busy fellows, so if my readers are not repaid
        for reading these lines, it surely must be laid on somebody else.
      </p>
      <p>
        To start with, my family consists of my better half, <span wc_id=
        "I829">Grace</span>, and my three children, <span wc_id="I832">Anna
        Louise</span> aged twelve, <span wc_id="I831">William Elisha</span>,
        aged eleven, and <span wc_id="I833">Barbara Jane</span><sup>1</sup> and
        my bald headed self. Yes, the bald head is a Horton trait. We are all
        husky, and good eaters, and believe me, we are living in the best
        section of the country of which this fair land of ours can boast, and
        if some of our Eastern friends could only see this land, they would say
        so too.
      </p>
      <p>
        On leaving the East eight years ago, we came to Independence and tried
        our energy at ranching, and after finding out the first year that it
        takes more than muscle to be a success at ranching, we jumped in for a
        new comer, they say we did fairly well. During the three years that we
        farmed, we came to know the troubles and needs of the farmers in this
        section and it was a very easy step then to go into a hardware and
        implement business and make a go of it. Today for my pleasure and bread
        and butter I am selling farming implements and hardware and can tell
        you the first name of every farmer withing fifteen miles of us and
        whether he likes a tractor or believes in old Dobbin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Willamette Valley is a garden spot and our sole trouble is to get
        rid of our produce.

        For those relatives who desire good fishing, good hunting, good camping
        and a glad-to-be-living feeling, come to Oregon and truly live. For
        those whom we cannot satisfy that way, why, we will keep them so busy
        that they will soon want to go camping.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will all look forward to this April edition of the letters and only
        trust that some of our relatives will drop in on us, for the latch
        string is always out<sup>2</sup> and there is generally plenty to eat.
        Let's see who will be the first to surprise us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile we wish to be remembered to everybody we know and hope that
        sometime we may be able to see a goodly number of you in person.
      </p>
      <p>
        With love and best wishes to you all.

      2. Pioneer's cabins in early PA had no doorknobs. On the inside of the
      door, was a piece of wood,&nbsp; several inches long, that pivoted. When
      it dropped into a holder fastened to the door frame, the door was
      "latched" shut and secure. A visitor had to knock or call out, to have
      the door opened for them. A string was tied to the latch, so if everyone
      was leaving the house, they pulled the string so that when the door
      closed, the string could be pulled up to open the door and get back in.
      The end of the latch string could be left out when people were at home
      --- as a signal to visitors to come on in..<br>
