      <p>
        Thought best to start this week right by writing you on Monday
        morning.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        How are you all this morning, I wonder? Well and happy I hope.

        Looking at the "Correspondence Book" I notice that my last letter was
        dated October 5th, -- six months ago. Very little has happened since
        then in my home life to write about. I am sort of a "shut-in" in the
        winter time, especially. Hope to live where I can get out more before
        long<sup>1</sup>.

        <em></em><em></em>Since my last letter, we have a new baby in the
        family. <span wc_id="I1276">Elizabeth</span> has another little son

      <p>
        1. I'm not sure what she meant by that. Women didn't drive in those
        days. Their farm was at the end of a private road, but her husband had
        a milk route and needed to get his truck out each day. The town
        wouldn't have plowed their road, but he had a scraper pulled by a team,
        so he could remove the snow in winter, and in the muddy spring, scrape
        the road to reduce the ruts. They also owned a small house in town (not
        far from the Presbyterian Church) which they purchased for her mother,
        Phebe CAMPBELL Hoyt, and still owned into the 1940s. (I stayed there
        some holidays and have fond memories of playing in its parlor.) Perhaps
        she was considering living in town the next winter. - wbt

        2. My namesake in appreciation of he and Inez raising my mother after
        her father's death. - wbt
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Inez' children died very young. She felt strong attachments to her 3
        nieces. - wbt
