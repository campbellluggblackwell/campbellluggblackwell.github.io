        My dear Aunts, Uncles and Cousins:

      <p>
        I think all of you know from preceding letters that we are living in
        the Sunny South.

      <p>
        "<a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Cousin Tommy</a>" seemed to have so
        many strings to his kite, that he prevailed upon us to come here and
        hang on to the one attached to the Campbell House<sup>1</sup> for a
        time. Consequently, we sold our business<sup>2</sup> in Rochester, N.
        Y., shipped our few possessions and have taken charge of the Hotel,
        while my <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">father</a> and <a href=
        "ParksFrances1855.html">mother</a>, with <a href=
        "CampbellMary1851.html">Aunt Mary Shipman</a> and the Pratts are living
        in a new house which my father and <span wc_id="I1680">Uncle Espencer
        Pratt</span> have built this winter.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have had a very pleasant and successful season with anticipations of
        a two month trip up North during the summer. However, the House is
        filling up with summer guests, as fast as the winter visitors are
        leaving, which makes us think we are in a summer resort as well as a
        winter playground.
      </p>
      <p>
        All three of the children are here with us, the two boys are in school,
        while <span wc_id="I1696">Frances</span> is busy at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are anxiously looking forward to the receipt of the annual letters.
