        Dear <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Brother</a> and Cousins:-

        I do not know of another family who have a Correspondence Club. It
        surely is a very satisfactory way of hearing twice a year from each
        Cousin. I already feel better acquainted with those who are so far away
        that we seldom see them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was so glad that Cousin <a href="BixbyHannah1863.html">Hannah
        Hughey</a> proved herself such a good correspondent, as she and
        <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Aunt Jane</a> used to keep in touch
        with each other and Aunt Jane would read the Western letters to all
        interested parties. I missed them after they ceased; hope she will come
        East and visit us sometime soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alta is real well again after a year and three months of illness of
        anemia and nerve trouble,- thanks to blood and electric treatments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our branch of the family consists of my brother, <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Wm. E. Selph</a>, his daughter <span wc_id=
        "I1605">Doris</span>, and myself,- so that there are not many to write
        about.<br>

        We enjoyed our annual "Dinner" at Mansfield with Cousins <a href=
        "ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel</a> and <span wc_id=
        "I773">Llewellyn</span>. The "Dinner" was a success in every way. I
        think twelve or fourteen of the First Cousins must have been there.
        Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charles Congdon</a> and
        <span wc_id="I1057">Laura Mourie</span> each extended us an invitation
        to meet with them in 1924, but it is undecided which place to go.
      </p>
      <p>
        We took our vacation this Summer in Northern New York, including the
        Adirondack Mountains. Cousins <a href="EllisonHugh1888.html">Hugh</a>
        and <span wc_id="I876">Virginia</span> and two friends of theirs
        accompanied us. The mountains are beautiful. I saw fresh deer track by
        Moose River and almost imagined I was a hunter. We rowed to the beaver
        dams and houses and examined them closely; they are built of poplars
        about three or four inches in diameter. We caught some fish than we
        could eat, although our appetites were excellent. But, Oh! The horrid
        "punkies",smaller than the smallest fly, who were our companions night
        and day;- screens don't count.
      </p>
      <p>
        My brother (our Secretary) sometimes censures are on short letters. I
        think he will have no reason this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Best wishes to all,
