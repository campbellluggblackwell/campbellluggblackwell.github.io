        Dear Cousins:-

      <p>
        The time has nearly expired and here I am with nothing to say, so how
        can I write. You have heard of people waiting until the last day in the
        afternoon and it is nearly the last afternoon of the week, "that's me".

        We did not have a very cold winter and not so much snow compared with
        other winters but we have had a very late cold Spring; and are just
        beginning to have some warm days. It makes one think of house cleaning.

        <span wc_id="I1112">My husband</span> and I are alone now that our
        <span wc_id="I1116">eldest son</span> is married and lives in Buffalo.
        The <span wc_id="I1121">other son</span> is in Buffalo also and it
        falls on me to be chore boy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have six hens and nearly every day get half a dozen eggs. How's that?

      <p>
        The farmers have just begun to spray their orchards; it has been so
        cold, only just last week we had a heavy ice store <span class=
        "Annotation">[storm?]</span>; it lasted only a few hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have not been to Nelson, since last October, so do not know much
        about what is going on down there. I have not driven the car so far
        alone but am going to try it when I am sure the Pennsylvania mud is
        dried up. <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Mother</a> writes that the
        roads are terrible.<sup>1</sup>

        We are living in the same place as last year; if any of the Cousins
        happen to be up this way would be glad to see them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hoping there will be a goodly number of letters this year and that they
        have not all been as slow as I have been, I am

        1. In 1926, except for within cities, few roads were paved -- dirt road
        were the rule, not the exception. Sticky mud and deep ruts made travel
        difficult for those on horseback, very difficult for horsed drawn
        vehicles, and almost impossible for autos.
