        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        April first is <u>fast approaching</u>. Those two words are borrowed
        from a composition written by <a href="CampbellJoseph1839.html">Uncle
        Joe Campbell</a>, when he was very young. I found it among some papers
        of my <a href="CampbellMaria1842.html">mother</a>'s, and of course
        Uncle Joe wanted it and I gave it to him, and now I have forgotten
        it<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems to be that this has been an eventful year in the history of
        the Campbell Clan - so that no one need to keep silence for lack of
        news.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of you know that I had a vacation last fall in October, when I
        visited at Marshalls Falls, Pa.<sup>1</sup>, Madison, N.J.<sup>2</sup>,
        Maplewood, N.J.<sup>3</sup>, and New York City<sup>4</sup>. As I had
        never been out of Nelson, that is very far out, you can imagine what
        the trip meant to me, and it has been a great comfort to me all winter.
        I have not been away from home since I returned last fall, but I think
        now if <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Ann Owlett</a> ever gets settled
        again, she will stay here and let me take another short vacation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have not seen the girls<sup>5</sup> as often as usual this winter.
        The roads have been bad, and are still almost impassable<sup>6</sup>.
        How good it will seem to get all the letters again. To hear from all
        the cousins great and small.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of you may not know that <span wc_id="I2369">Charlie
        Blackwell</span> has a granddaughter, <span wc_id="I2421">Caroline
        M.</span>, daughter of <span wc_id="I2376">Enoch</span> and
        <span wc_id="I2377">Cora</span>. This is quite an important event,
        being the only girl ever born in <a href=
        "BlackwellEnoch1814.html">Uncle Enoch</a>'s family<sup>7</sup>. Three
        grandchildren already<sup>8</sup>, and they are fine, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am wondering if <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie Congdon</a>
        has settled in California<sup>9</sup>, or will he walk in some day
        soon? I can not think of any important events in my life lately. Aunt
        Eunice<sup>10</sup> and I have survived the long cold winter. She is
        feeling fine, but I am pretty well used up this spring. Think I would
        like to join the Florida friends another winter.

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. Marshall Falls, the summer home of Cousin Charlie Congdon, was the
        site of the previous fall's "Cousins Dinner."
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Madison was the home of Cousin Geo. L. Buck.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Maplewood was the home of Cousin Will Selph.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.Both Will Selph and Charlie Congdon had their office in NYC. Charlie
        lived there when he was not "on the road" for his school music
        publishing business or at his summer home
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Her daughters, Eva HOOKER Hills and Treva HOOKER Hazlett.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Most roads in the US were unpaved back then. So Spring rains turned
        them into deep seas of mud, in which cars would sink to their axles.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Stella isn't counting Charlie Blackwell's adoptive daughter, Ruth
        Sarah BAILEY/BLACKWELL Partridge. It was quite common back then to
        exclude adoptees from list of people children. Consciously or not, many
        seemed to think that only "blood" relatives counted.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. I'm not sure about the 3 grandchildren Stella was referring to were.
        One was Enoch Delivan Blackwell, a son of Cora. Another was Lockwood
        Preston Blackwell, who died later that year, before he was a year old.
        But I don't know of a third born before Mar. 27, 1925, Perhaps another
        died in infancy. Cora later had a second daughter, Mariam Frances
        BLACKWELL Bliss.
      </p>
      <p>
        9. Charlie Congdon's daughter Bernice convelesced for more than 2 years
        in AZ and CA, accompanied by Charlie's wife and by Bernice' sister,
        Louise.
      </p>
      <p>
        10. "Aunt Eunice" refers to Eunice LOOP Smith, sister of Stella's
        father.

        I have not had a detailed account of <a href=
        "BosardAnna1860.html">Cousin Ann</a>'s trip yet. So you see I have that
        pleasure in store. I expect to take a back seat, but we are all so glad
        that she could have such a nice vacation, even though sorrow and
        suffering<sup>11</sup> filled several weeks, and we know that it was a
        great comfort to <span wc_id="I1050">Mary</span> and <a href=
        "BosardFlorence1887.html">Florence</a> to have her with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, we can not look into the future, but the past has been wonderful,
        and we can trust Our Heavenly Father to "lead us gently home".

        11. Anna was there to help with the illness of her sister-in-law,
        Jennie CRANE Bosard, who died while Anna was there.
