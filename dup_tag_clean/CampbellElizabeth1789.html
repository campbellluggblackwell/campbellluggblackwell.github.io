      <big>Elizabeth CAMPBELL Ellison (1789 - 18xx)<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>Elizabeth was born Jul. 21, 1789, in N. Ireland or possibly
      Scotland; d. 18xx, in Tioga Co., PA. She married <span wc_id=
      "I14">Richard Ellison</span>, born in England.<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>Elizabeth was the 4th of 8 children of <a href=
      "CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph Campbell</a>, b. 1748, in Scotland, d.
      1824 in Nelson, PA, (originally called <a href=
      "BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's Island</a>); and <a href=
      "HarperMary1749.html">Mary Harper</a>, b. 1749, in Scotland, d. 1844 in
      Nelson.<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>Elizabeth's older sister <a href="CampbellSarah1777.html">Sally</a>,
      and brother, <a href="CampbellJohn1781.html">John</a>, came to America
      before their younger siblings. We're not sure exactly when. Sometime
      between 1800 and 1802 seems likely for Sally and husband <a href=
      "HazlettSamuel1780.html">Sam Hazlett</a> --- their first child,
      <span wc_id="I38">Archibald Hazlett</span> was born in Lancaster Co., PA
      in 1803. John, Mary, and Elizabeth Campbell may have come slightly later.
      Brother John Campbell married soon after his arrival and shortly
      thereafter moved to what is now Pittsburgh. Mary and husband,
      <span wc_id="I12">John Hazlett</span> (no known relation to Sam), settled
      in Lancaster Co. Mary's son Robert, was born in PA in 1809, so we know
      she was here before then. Elizabeth apparently lived with them.<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>Elizabeth's parents, and youngest siblings sailed from Londonderry
      to Perth Amboy, NJ in 1810 and went to Sam Hazlett's farm (he was then
      living near Stroudsburg, PA) before going to Nelson. Elizabeth apparently
      did not join them and go to Nelson at that time.<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>John Campbell and wife <span wc_id="I13">Elizabeth Bell</span> moved
      to a farm near Pittsburgh shortly after they married,</big> <big>before
      his parents came to America. He and Elizabeth never came to Nelson.
      John's oldest sister Sarah/Sally, came to America about 1800. John and
      his sisters, Mary and Elizabeth, may not have come until 1806.</big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>After Mary's death in 1824, her husband and children moved to a farm
      near his brother-in-law, John Campbell, in what is now Pittsburgh's North
      side.<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>It's not certain when Elizabeth left Lancaster Co., moved to Tioga
      Co., and married Richard Ellison, one of the early settlers of Beecher's
      Island.<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>Elizabeth Campbell and Richard Ellison had no children.<br></big>
