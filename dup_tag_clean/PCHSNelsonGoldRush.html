    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NELSON, NOV. 24.---After long and earnest discussion by
    the Roop Club of this place, it has been decided to render Harriet Beecher
    Stowe's great comedy, "Uncle Tom's Cabin," sometime during the winter, for
    the benefit of the Klondike fund. It was first intended by this talented
    organization to entertain with "As You Like It;" but the fact that we have
    in our midst a gentleman who had large experience on the road with
    Stetson's Original Uncle Tom's Cabin troupe, and the said gentleman
    offering his services as instructor for the privilege of playing "Gumption
    Cute," the majority reluctantly concluded to put "Uncle Tom's Cabin" on the
    board. A few only of the cast have yet been&nbsp; assigned. Those who will
    positively appear are: Frank Elliott as Gumption Cute and instructor;
    Walter Loop as St. Clair; <a href="CampbellJoseph1839.html">J. D.
    Campbell</a> as Uncle Tom, F. E. Selph as Marks the Lawyer;&nbsp;
    <span wc_id="I13532">Ray Bake</span>r as Legree---(he will borrow his dogs
    from Fred Hammond of Elkland). There are so many that want to take the part
    of Eva, Miss Ophelia and Topsy that undoubtedly there will have to be two
    Topsy's and two Miss Ophelia's, as also numbers will necessitate two Marks
    the Lawyers. Without doubt this will be the greatest treat ever given the
    people of this village and vicinity. Should everything come to pass as
    hoped, no doubt Elkland, Knoxville, Westfield and probably Elmira and
    Corning will offer this aggregation great inducements to appear in those
    towns. Mr. Elliot is entirely competent to carry the matter through to a
    successful end, and unless our citizens get the idea too thoroughly into
    their heads that this is only a scheme to raise money to defray the
    expenses of some of the boys to the Alaska gold fields, a great crowd will
    greet them each and every night.<br>
