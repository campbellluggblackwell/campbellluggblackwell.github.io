        Our Website
      </h3>
      <p>
        Our family history website has more than 500 pages of old letters,
        photos, news clips, family records, etc. But searching it can present
        problems. <a href="GuideSearchingOurSite_Rev3A.html">Page one</a> of
        this "guidebook" covered the basics of using our site's search engine,
        <em>FreeFind</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page covers more advanced search techniques, that may be useful to
        someone who does a lot of searches -- or who has very specific or very
        complex search needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        A third page, "<a href="GuideSearchingOurSite_Rev3C.html">Case
        Studies</a>", covers actuall searches people made, and discusses
        alternate search queries that might have produced better results for
        them
      </p>
      <div>
        <h3>
          Our Site Specific Search Engine
        </h3>
        <p>
          <img alt="image of search box" src="SearchBox.jpg" style=
          "float: left; width: 172px; height: 180px; margin-right:50"> As
          discussed on Page 1, the search window is located at the upper left
          of our website's home page.&nbsp; We can do a lot, just using its
          search box.

        <h3>
          RECAP
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>ANDs and ORs.</strong> You learned that if you type in
          <strong><em>cat dog pig</em></strong>, it will give you a list of all
          the web pages that contain the word 'cat', or the word 'dog', or the
          word 'pig'. You also learned to do "AND" searches, not just OR
          searches. That If you wanted all the web pages that contained the
          word 'Robert' and also the word 'Lugg' you could use the plus sign.
          E.g. by typing <strong><em>+robert +lugg</em></strong> in the search
          box you'd get an AND search.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <strong>PHRASES.</strong> You learned that you can search for a phrase,
        such as <strong><em>Robert Lugg</em></strong>, by entering <em>"robert
        lugg"</em>, enclosed in quotes, into the search box. That will give you
        all occurrences of the word 'Robert' followed immediately by the word
        'Lugg'. We have a Robert Preston Lugg in the family tree plus a Robert
        Samuel Lugg and a Robert Sherer Lugg. Typing <strong><em>"robert p.
        lugg"</em></strong> into the search block would find some instances of
        the former and <strong><em>"robert s. lugg"</em></strong> would find
        some instances of the second & third.
      </p>
      <p>
        You also learned to use a "wildcard" to represent any character in a
        phrase. We could find instances of all of them in one search by using
        the wildcard symbol <strong><em>?</em></strong>&nbsp; to stand for
        <u>any</u> character. Entering <strong><em>"robert ?.
        lugg"</em></strong> into the search box would find instances of any of
        them in one search.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ending a search word with a wild card.</strong>
        <em>FreeFind</em> by default finds variations of an English language
        "word root." If you search for 'climb' it will retrieve 'climbs',
        'climbed' and 'climbing'. And if you search for 'Green' it will
        retrieve 'Greene' as well. You also learned that if you want to search
        for both 'Seely' and 'Seeley' you can do that by entering
        <strong><em>seel*</em></strong> into the search box.
      </p>
      <div class="wonk">
        <p>
          <img alt="image of the advanced search screen" src=
          "AdvancedSearchScreen.jpg" style=
          "width: 518px; height: 237px; float: right; margin-left: 20px;">But
          if you want to do a more complex search, click on <a href=
          "https://search.freefind.com/find.html?si=6928854&amp;pid=a">advanced
          search</a>. That allows you to use ANDs and NOTs, to control your
          search, not just ORs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of the options in the shaded area, You may be interested in the check
          box for <strong><em>case sensitive</em></strong>. Usually
          <em>FreeFind</em> doesn't care whether the letters you type into the
          search box(es) are upper or lower case, nor the letters in the
          documents it's searching. But if you are searching for the surname
          'Young' and don't want documents containing "young boy" among your
          "hits", then check that box and make sure you capitalize 'Young' in
          the search box.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, you want to search specifically for a German word/name
          containing an umlaut, or a French word/name containing an acute or
          grave, Scandinavian word/name containing some of their special
          characters, you'd put a check mark in <strong><em>accent
          sensitive</em></strong> check box and include the special
          character(s) you're looking for in the search box.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Knowing the Territory
        </h3>
        <p>
          A character in the play <em>Music Man</em> proclaimed "Ya gotta know
          the territory." Obviously knowing what's on the site isn't a
          prerequisite for searching the site. But familiarity with the way the
          writers of the documents expressed themselves helps. For example, if
          you read a lot of the documents on this site you'll see that men
          often <strong>used initials</strong> instead of first and middle
          names. "T. C. Campbell", "M. B. Seely", "J. Edward Hazlett", etc. So,
          a search for "Thomas Campbell" or "Mark Seely" or "James Hazlett"
          will miss those documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Name Flipping/omitting:</strong> You also have a better
          chance of finding the document you want if you realize that in those
          days it was common for someone to "flip" their first and last names
          -- "Phoebe Jessica Hoyt" became "Jessica Phoebe Hoyt"; "Thomas Edgar
          Congdon" became "Edgar Thomas Congdon", etc. Searchers need to be
          flexible and search multiple ways. Or, especially with women,
          sometimes drop their first name entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Spelling Variations:</strong> Spelling rules weren't rigid.
          Phebe (Campbell) Hoyt always spelled her given name without the 'o'.
          If you only search for <em>Phoebe</em> you'll miss a lot of web pages
          <span class="Annotation">[unless indexing volunteers come to your
          rescue]</span>. Many names have variant spellings: Green/Greene,
          Seely/Seeley, Mourie/Mourey/Mowrey, Haslet/Hazelett/Hazels/Hazlett.
          Even Johnson/Yonson.
        </p>
        <p>
          But those problems almost disappear for our web pages that have been
          indexed by a <a href=
          "https:sties.rootsweb.com/capane/volunteer.html">volunteer</a>. Our
          site's search engine, <em>FreeFind</em>, can recognize index terms
          that have been added to a document. When it's not clear who a
          document is referring to, we've added links that make it clear to
          human readers who is being talked about. But the contents of the
          links isn't accessible by search engines -- they only "see" words
          that occur in the document. If a document mentions "Lish", a
          volunteer indexing the webpage can add "Elisha Horton" as a
          <strong>keyword</strong>. <span class="Annotation">[The indexer knows
          his name because they can click on the link.]</span> If the document
          mentions "Aunt Jane", thanks to the link, the indexer can add "Jane
          Campbell Tubbs" and "Jane Tubbs" as keywords. The trick is to think
          "if someone wants to find this document, what words need to be added
          in order for <em>FreeFind</em> to find it. Volunteer indexers ask
          themselves, "What search terms would someone looking for this
          document use?" Many of our webpages have been indexed, but most have
          not. Volunteers who index our web pages greatly improve the chances
          of a searcher's success.

        <h3>
          Common Errors & Smart Searching
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our webmaster gets reports from <em>FreeFind</em> about the searches
          that are made. Not who was searching, but the search terms used and a
          link to the "hits" found by each search. So we gain some insights
          into what search strategies work and which ones don't work. Of course
          we can't read the searcher's mind and know for sure what he/she had
          in mind. But we can see, and infer, a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>SEARCHING for LIVING PEOPLE.</strong> Except in a few cases,
          such as minutes or programs of recent Campbell Reunions, living
          people aren't mentioned on these web pages. <span class=
          "Annotation">[Our Facebook pages or YouTube pages provide better
          hunting for them.]</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>OR, AND, Phrases.</strong> OR is the default. For instance,
          entering <strong><em>robert lugg</em></strong> in the search box will
          search our site for all pages that contain the word 'Robert'
          <u>or</u> the word 'Lugg'. Which is fine if that's what you intended
          -- but "OR" searches can produce a VERY long hit list.
        </p>
        <p class="wonk">
          Alternatively, by entering <strong><em>robert AND lugg</em></strong>,
          where 'and' must be in upper case. (With AND or OR searches, word
          order in the search box doesn't matter.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Phrases</strong> are the technique to use if word order
          matters. If you're looking for occurrences the word 'robert'
          immediately followed by the word 'lugg', then type
          <strong><em>"robert lugg"</em></strong> in the search box. But those
          searches wouldn't find occurrences of Robert P. Lugg or of Robert S.
          Lugg.
        </p>
        <p class="wonk">
          But it wouldn't find occurrences of 'Robert Preston Lugg' or 'Robert
          Samuel Lugg' or 'Robert Sherer Lugg'. We could find all of those in a
          single search if we typed <strong><em>[robert lugg]</em></strong>
          into the search box, using square brackets instead of double quote
          marks. The square brackets instruct <em>FreeFind</em> to search for a
          phrase, but allow there to be a couple of intervening words. And if
          instead of square brackets we use braces (sometimes called "curly
          brackets"), <strong><em>{robert lugg}</em></strong> into the search
          box that would allow a few more intervening words.
        </p>
        <div class="wonk">
          <p>
            You could even find 'Mourey', 'Mowrey' and 'Mourie' in a single
            search by entering <strong><em>Mo?r*</em></strong> into the search
            box -- if you were aware of those spelling variations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Boolean Searches.</strong> Important to some will be the
            ability to do <em>boolean searches</em>, e.g. the ability to uses
            parentheses in searches. For instance we could type
            <strong><em>(john OR james OR sam*) AND (campbell OR
            hazl*)</em></strong> in the search box.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>
          Practice Makes Perfect
        </h3>
        <p>
          That's a lot to absorb in one setting. But the more searches you do,
          the better you'll become at it.
