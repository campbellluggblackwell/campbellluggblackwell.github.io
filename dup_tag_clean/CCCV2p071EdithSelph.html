        Dear Cousins:
      </p>

      <p>
        No one realizes, better than I do, the truth of the old adage:
        "Procrastination is the thief of time." This letter was to have been
        written for the C. C. C. nearly one year ago and it is not because I
        have received no "daily reminder" that it has not materialized before
        this, but my delay may be explained by the familiar excuse, "lack of
        time," and may also be illustrated by the above saying.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">William</a> has told you much about us;
        and I will add that we are occupied with various interests most of the
        time. We are both connected with the Methodist Church in our town,
        which is in reality, -- a Community Church, -- and stands on the corner
        nearly opposite our home. William sings with the men on special
        occasions and is a member of the Men's Club and other organizations of
        the Church. The writer is especially interested in the Missionary work
        of our Societies and we are, of course, in sympathy with improvement
        affairs and general betterment. We are members of our local New England
        Society which holds very interesting meetings, and there is also a very
        fine Country Club here with tennis, golf and bowling advantages. With
        home keeping, outside interests and occasional trips to the city for
        me, we keep quite occupied.

        <span wc_id="I1605">Doris</span> is now speaking for herself in this
        volume; we miss her presence in the home very greatly; but keep in
        touch with her all the time. She is a regular and explicit
        correspondent and this is a joy to her parents and to her <span wc_id=
        "I13671">grandmother</span>, who is with us.

      <p>
        Last summer, "we three Selphs" boarded our faithful old car one
        beautiful morning in July and started from Mt. Tabor<sup>1</sup>, where
        we summer, for Tioga County. If I were to go into details of the trip,
        I should occupy much space; but during our two weeks' stay in
        Pennsylvania, we made very many calls and visits and were dined and
        treated royally by the Cousins, one and all. We always visit the farm,
        -- "<span wc_id="I967">Uncle Allen</span>'s farm," where William was
        born and spent his early boyhood days, and "<a href=
        "CampbellMaryAnn1826.html">Aunt Mary Ann</a>" has become a familiar
        name to Doris and to me. The beautiful views up the valley and glen, I
        always delight in feasting my eyes upon, and they are equal to many
        which are much further distant. In fact, I think I appreciate

        Once, I visited <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">Aunt Phoebe</a>'s farm
        in the autumn when the foliage was gorgeous and I have never forgotten.
        And the view from <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Cousin Ann Owlett</a>'s
        farm is very fine. I might write on indefinitely and describe many more
        pictures which have painted themselves in my memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        This past year, we had the opportunity to add largely to this mental
        picture gallery, for we have just returned from Washington where we, or
        rather I, have been getting acquainted with <a href=
        "CraneJennie1852.html">Cousin Jennie Bosard</a>, <span wc_id=
        "I1050">Mary</span> and <span wc_id="I1051">her husband</span>,
        <a href="BosardFlorence1887.html">Florence</a>, and <span wc_id=
        "I1052">Austin</span>. We have been travelling <span class=
        "Annotation">[sic]</span> about the city together for several days,
        trying to "see everything." Perhaps some of the Cousins will not object
        if I tell about a few of the "sights"; for it is very difficult for me
        to write a letter just now and not talk "Washington."<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Last Thursday, we arrived at the fine Union Station in the late
        afternoon and went directly to Cousin Jennie's house. In the evening,
        Mary and her husband took us out for our first glimpse of the Capitol,
        -- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">our</span> Capitol It is a
        wonderful sight! Standing on an elevation, majestically proportioned,
        dignified and commanding, and lighted by many searchlights thrown upon
        it, it shines forth out of the darkness like a marble palace. its dome,
        towering high, may be seen for miles around. Later, we visited the
        interior of the Capitol; here, we saw the historical paintings, and
        statutory hall and sat in both Houses of Congress while in session.
        This is a most interesting place to visit; here is transacted the
        affairs of our nation for weal or woe. There came to us, a new
        realization of the great responsibility which rests upon those who
        represent us there, and <span style=
        "text-decoration: underline;">our</span> responsibility in choosing
        such representatives wisely.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is practically impossible to describe the beautiful library of
        Congress, located opposite the Capitol, and built of New Hampshire and
        Maryland granite. Here we saw the Copyright Office, a reading room for
        the blind, wonderful rare books, pictures and statuary. The beautiful
        Italian marble staircase, the great reading room with its dome
        encrusted with white and gold flowers, the mural paintings and mosaic
        picture of Minerva are well worth a journey of many miles. Many
        quotations are lettered in gold on pillars and walls and like the
        following illustration are well worth remembering:

        A few weeks ago the original writings of the Declaration of
        Independence and the Constitution of the United States were placed in
        the Library in beautiful cases; and were glad to view these important
        documents of our country, now located permanently and fittingly.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, we made a pilgrimage to Mount Vernon where we could picture
        our first President, returned from the turmoil of war and public life,
        standing on the piazza looking across the peaceful Potomac. This is a
        beautiful home and you would enjoy seeing the many relics. The key to
        the Bastille, presented by Lafayette; Washington's dress sword, the
        harpsichord of Nellie Custis and many other things. It is here that
        Washington died; and we looked into his room and into that of Martha
        Washington, -- away upstairs, -- chosen by her because from the little
        window she could see her husband's burial place. We stood before their
        tomb where were the wreaths reverently laid by General Joffre and King
        Albert of Belgium; and we wished that all Americans might have the
        opportunity to visit our American shrines. In Alexandria, we sat in
        Washington's pew in Christ Church.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        More than sixty thousand soldiers have been laid to rest in Arlington
        Cemetery<sup>2</sup>, and an impressive sight is the row after row of
        simple, white stones which mark their graves. Here lie many of our boys
        brought from France and here also is the tomb of the Unknown Soldier,
        just outside the beautiful, dignified, marble Amphitheater which seats
        five thousand people out-of-doors. From this point, there is a fine
        view of the Washington Monument, which towers more than five hundred
        feet above the city and may be seen from every point in Washington. One
        never loses sight of it.<br>

        The Bureau of Printing and Engraving turns out our Liberty
        Bonds<sup>3</sup>, postage stamps and paper currency and we saw several
        of the processes.<br>

        Then we visited the Green, Blue and East rooms of the White House and
        looked also at the new painting of Mrs. Coolidge, which is very lovely.
        In the gardens, hyacinths, daffodils and tulips were blooming, robins
        were gaily hopping about, indifferent to their notable surroundings,
        and as we looked upon the green lawns at the rear of the house, we
        could see, -- in imagination, -- the children in Washington following
        the time-honored custom of egg-rolling on Easter Monday.<br>

        The National Museums are interesting; and the men Cousins would hie at
        once to see the exhibit of African animals collected by
        Roosevelt<sup>4</sup> and the models of steam engines, boats, and
        relics of the World War; while their wives would look interestedly at
        the gowns worn by the Presidential wives and at the collections of
        samplers, old laces and china.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I almost forgot the Pan-American Building. You would all be delighted
        could you step into the entrance which is a facsimile of the one found
        in a South American home,- with its fountain in the centre, surrounded
        by palms and other Southern trees, and birds fluttering around. The
        Hall of the Americas is most beautiful; and the adjoining smaller room,
        with its long table surrounded by chairs significantly united with red,
        white and blue rope, is the monthly meeting place of representatives of
        twenty-one republics.<br>

      <p>
        The Lincoln Memorial is beautifully situated in Potomac Park. The
        enormous seated figure of Lincoln there is said to be one of the best
        statues of him ever made. The simple beauty of this memorial cannot
        fail to leave an indelible impression on all who see it.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        On Sunday afternoon, our Cousins took us to see the National Soldier's
        Home, Rock Creek Park which Roosevelt loved and enjoyed so well, and
        the last resting place of Woodrow Wilson; from this high point, there
        is a wonderful bird's eye view of the City.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I am going to give a recipe to the Cousins who have said at
        various times that they are tired of winter and want to see spring
        come. On Sunday, -- the Springtime came to Washington in all its
        glory!. Buds burst open, flowers bloomed and most gorgeous of all, --
        hundreds of cherry trees from Japan which surround the Potomac
        basin<br>

      burst into pink and white bloom all at once, -- great bouquets of
      flowers. Never have we seen such a wonderful floral sight; it was
      difficult to turn away from its beauty; but we gazed and gazed until a
      picture was indelibly painted on our minds and we shall never forget
      beautiful "Cherry Blossom Time in Washington" Now, don't you all want to
      visit our "National Capital City in Springtime?

        And, -- we saw our President, -- Calvin Coolidge. And, we hope when we
        again visit Washington, -- perhaps next year, -- we will still find him
        in the same capacity, Chief Executive of our Nation.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, we finally awoke to the fact that our visit to Washington was
        over for this year, and we boarded the train for our homeward trip.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The next morning, when I looked out of my window, I discovered that
        spring was on its way to Maplewood too; for I beheld my long row of
        golden daffodils all blooming in our garden; -- my wealth of gold, -- I
        call them. We are now "settling down" to daily tasks with many new
        scenes and pleasures to think of.<br>

        You are undoubtedly saying that I have taken more than my share of
        space in this book, but you see, I am making up for lost time and this
        letter is a year in length.<br>

        P.S. You know a letter is always more valuable when it adds a
        postscript. I brought a copy of "The American's Creed" home with me
        from Washington. There may be some of us who have not read it in just
        this form and if our Secretary <span class="Annotation">[her husband
        --- wbt]</span> will permit, I am going to request that it may be added
        to my letter, and I am also going to request my daughter to learn it by
        heart.
