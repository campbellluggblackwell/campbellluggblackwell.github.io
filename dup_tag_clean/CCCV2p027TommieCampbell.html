        Dear Ones All:

        I understand that this third "Cousins Letter" is to be a sort of
        conglomerate affair, dealing mostly with our immediate families and
        their doings, intermingled with other family reminiscences, -- and for
        the pas six months, (dreading this letter), in my day dreams I have
        thought of many "Gems" I would incorporate in it, but alas, as the time
        approaches to write you they have all faded away, like the flowers of
        Spring up North.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of my immediate family, <span wc_id="I1692">Mary</span> (Shewman) and
        family are with us here, and are running the hotel<sup>1</sup>. They
        have it full (capacity sixty guests) all winter, while they have fed
        twice that number at their tables, but they seem to enjoy it, -- are
        good entertainers, and are very popular with their guests. They are
        anxious for me to double the capacity of the hotel which I may do a
        little later.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;Our daughter <span wc_id="I1703">Ruth</span> (Mitchell) and
        family are living in Rochester, N. Y., where her husband has steady and
        lucrative employment, and they are coming on just fine in their new
        bungalow, -- but we are hoping to have them with us before long.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sister <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">Mary Shipman</a> is spending the
        winter with us here. This is her first trip to the land of eternal
        sunshine and flowers, and she seems to be enjoying every minute of her
        time. We surely do enjoy having her with us.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Our city has entertained about 100,000 tourists this season, and among
        them some of the most noted men and women of the platform and pulpit,
        -- so there is not an afternoon or evening that Sister Mary cannot have
        a choice of five or six regular feasts of elevating literary
        entertainment, -- the thing she most enjoys but never has had such an
        opportunity to so fully gratify. But there is another stuff in her
        makeup so that she will occasionally enjoy a first class ball game with
        me,-- though I took her to the Boston Braves and the New York Giants
        play last week, and she left before the game was half over and
        sauntered back to the City Park and listened to the Scotch Highlanders
        Band. It was a mighty<br>

      it, but were very happy to turn its management over to Mary and her
      husband Curt.<br>

      interesting game too, the score being one to nothing in favor of the
      Giants. Then she enjoys the water sports, the movies, and the automobile
      rides, -- but the sunshine, fruits and flowers most of all.<br>

        How often, oh, how often, we have wished that all our nieces, nephews
        and cousins could come and spend a winter in our Sunshine City, where
        the flowers are ever in bloom, and the mocking bird's song is heard all
        day and all night. Where the sun shines three hundred and sixty out of
        every three hundred and sixty-five days, year after year, though many
        of us never knew it, -- but it is true just the same.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        We long to see you all, -- our latch string is always out, -- come and
        give it a pull<sup>2</sup>. While <span wc_id="I1691">Frank</span> and
        I do so much enjoy these things here, especially the climate, we are
        not forgetful of the dear old <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowanesque_River">Cowanesque Valley</a>
        with its little river winding along down at the foothills, nor can we
        ever forget the gorgeous beautiful foliage that decorates the hillsides
        at autumn time, -- for its equal we have never seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        And most of all our thoughts turn to the dear faces of the ones we
        seldom see but love so much. What a grand re-union we could have if we
        whose names appear in this book could meet face to face, -- not only
        the ones we know so well, but those we have never met, -- and get to
        know our kindred better. Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will
        Selph</a> is almost a "Miracle Man"; -- let us hope he evolves just
        such a gathering.
      </p>
      <p>
        We send love to each of you,
      </p>

      2. <u>Latch string is out ... give it a pull</u> --- Pioneer's cabins in
      early PA had no doorknobs. On the inside of the door, was a piece of
      wood, several inches long, that pivoted. When it dropped into a holder
      fastened to the door frame, the door was "latched" shut and secure. A
      visitor had to knock or call out, to have the door opened for them. A
      string was tied to the latch, so if everyone was leaving the house, they
      pulled the string so that when the door closed, the string could be
      pulled up to open the door and get back in. The end of the latch string
      could be left out when people were at home --- as a signal to visitors to
      come on in.<br>
