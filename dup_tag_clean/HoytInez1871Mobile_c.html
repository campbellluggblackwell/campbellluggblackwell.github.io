        <a href="HoytInez1871.html">Inez Hoyt</a> was born Oct. 12, 1871, in
        Nelson, Tioga Co., PA; d. there Sep. 25, 1934. Married Aug. 19, 1896 in
        Nelson to <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Boller-100">William
        Boller</a>, b. Jun. 29, 1867, in Wyoming Co., NY; d. Feb. 10, 1949 in
        Nelson. William's parents were <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Boller-1037">Rudolph Louis Boller</a>,
        born 1824 in Germany, and <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Ernest-192">Katrine Ernest</a>, born
        1832 in Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inez was the younger of 2 children of <a href=

        William and Inez Hoyt Boller had two children:

        <li>
          <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Boller-102">William Hoyt

        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        William and Inez Hoyt Boller's farm, abt. 96 acres, bordered NYS.
        Strait Creek ran through it, on its way to the Cowanesque River. The
        farm had a couple of small "flats" along the creek, but most of it was
        hillside. The working part of the farm was primarily on the west side
        of the creek. Much of the east side of the creek was a slope covered
        with hemlocks, with lady slippers and a wide variety of forest wild
        flowers.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <em>[When I stayed there in the 1940s on holidays or summer vacations,
        some of the flats were used for a plot of garden vegetables and the
        rest for a potato crop. The hillsides were used for raising hay for the
        Percheron horses that worked the farm and for pasture for the sheep
        that Billy Boller raised for wool and for sale.<br>
        <br>
        In Inez' day, it was very attractive and called "Rose Lawn Farm". When
        I knew it, the roses had been neglected for years, and the house
        unpainted as long. The plumbing was a well in the yard near the kitchen
        door and a small outhouse around the back. The latter was equipped with
        an old Sears catalog for double duty. Reading the interesting pages
        "during", and selecting uninteresting pages to tear out for "after".
        Lighting was by kerosene lamps. The heating was by a pot bellied coal
        stove in the kitchen. There was also a two burner kerosene counter top
        stove for cooking. The nearest telephone was at the neighboring farm of
        Inez's 2nd cousin twice removed, <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-681">George G. Hazlett</a>
        (grandfather of Bruce Rupar, Judy HAZLETT Abel & Linda HAZLETT
        Gardner).<br>
        <br>
        In the 1940, most people in Nelson and Farmington Townships had party
        lines. It was before dial phones --- phones had separate pieces for
        speaking and listening. The central exchange was a small plug board in
        the home of Campbell Cousin <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Owlett-57">John</a> and <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Mattison-417">Eva Mattison</a> Owlett,
        near the train station. Eva was the switchboard operator. As a boy, it
        was fascinating to watch her answer incoming calls and plug a wire to
        connect the caller to the person they were calling.<br>
        <br>
        It may sound primitive to those who've grown up with dial phones,
        private lines, and unaccustomed to dealing with operators, but it had
        advantages. My mother (<a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hoyt-211">Jessica HOYT</a> Thompson)
        could call Billy Boller even though he had no phone. When she wanted to
        speak to him, she would place a person-to-person call via the
        Binghamton, NY operator. You would hear a couple of rings before the
        Elmira, NY, operator answered. Then the Binghamton operator would say
        "Elmira, this is Binghamton, I have a person-to-person call for William
        Boller in Nelson, Pa." Then a couple of rings and Eva MATTISON Owlett
        would answer in her distinctive, somewhat nasal voice. The Elmira
        operator would say "Nelson, this is Elmira, I have a person-to-person
        call from Binghamton for William Boller." Eva would then say "Jessie,
        is that you Jessie?" and the two of them would talk. One of two
        scenarios would result.<br>
        <br>
        One would go as follows: "Jessie, Billy's not home now, I saw him drive
        to town about half an hour ago. I'll watch for him and flag him down
        when he comes back". Or, "I think he's home, I'll call George [Hazlett]
        to let Billy know you're calling." Then George would send <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-282">Ralph</a>, <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-682">Donald</a>, <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-683">Maynard</a>, <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-684">Cyril</a>, <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-685">Royce</a>, <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-686">Georgianna</a>, "<a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-686">Mert</a>," <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazett-688">York</a>, or "<a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazett-690">"&gt;Syke</a>" to Rose Lawn
        farm to let Billy know. Because the call was person-to-person, he could
        just go to any neighbor's or Eva's and return the call at no expense to
        them.<br>
        <br>
        The Bollers also had a second home, a house in Nelson, on the south
        side of the main street, a little west of the Presbyterian Church.
        Behind, and below it were flats along the Cowanesque, that were used
        for cow pasture. (I remember being told that one time the cows got
        drunk because a moonshiner dumped mash there --- spoiled the milk for a
        while.) That house was purchased as a mother-in-law house for Phebe
        CAMPBELL Hoyt, who had been living on Rose Lawn Farm with them. She
        only lived there a short time before breaking a hip and returning to
        the farm. Both houses had parlors filled with things fascinating to a
        boy - conch shells, cards covered with arrowheads, stone axes, skinning
        knives, pestles, antlers, uncut semi-precious stones, and civil war
        kit.<br>
        <br>
        Inez must have been a caring person. in addition to caring for her
        mother, after the death of brother <a href=
        "HoytJosephD1860.html">Joseph Hoyt</a>, she took in and raised niece
        Jessica Phoebe Hoyt (my mother). The two younger girls ( etty, Isabelle
        and their mother) stayed with their Goodrich grandparents. My mother
        always referred to Inez as "Auntie".<br>
        <br>
        In a addition to doing a little farming, Billy Boller also had a milk
        route. He had a large, stake body truck. He drove two routes, in Nelson
        and Farmington, starting while it was still dark, picking up the 50
        gallon milk cans the farmers had put out on roadside platforms. He
        managed to do that almost until he died, in spite of the weight of a
        full can. The milk was taken to the Pet Co. plant in Elkland, PA, where
        they made condensed milk (run by Campbell cousin <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Van_Dusen-516">Ross Van Dusen</a>.<br>
        <br>
        Billy's truck was an old, red <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REO_Motor_Car_Company">Reo</a>, which
        many of the older residents still remember well. I never saw it him do
        this, but my mother says that in his first few years of having it, when
        it wouldn't start on a cold morning, he would get a horse whip from the
        barn; then thoroughly whip the truck while swearing at it. I don't know
        how effective that was, but the truck stuck with him for a long
        time.<br>
        <br>
        He was also the leader of the Nelson band. I was told he played a tuba,
        but some of the pictures look like it may have been a baritone horn. I
        remember him "playing" Sousa marches in his sleep. Instead of talking
        in his sleep, you would hear a melodic "Pu-pu-pu-PA-pa-pum". He was my
        namesake. My siblings and I called him "Grampa Bill". - wbt]</em>
