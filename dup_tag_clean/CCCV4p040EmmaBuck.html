        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        In imagination I can see the different members of our notable
        organization, coming from the North, the South, the East and the West,
        each with his story of the past year. I think all are here who came
        last year, except for Cousin <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil
        Young</a>, whose tragic going we all deplore and most deeply sympathize
        with the family, - and <span wc_id="I1709">Gordon Parks</span>, more
        distantly connected, although <span wc_id="I1707">Jim</span> has always
        seemed one of us<sup>1</sup>; to him also we extend sympathy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The year passes so quickly when looked at as a unit; we hardly get the
        job of writing the "Cousins Letter" off our conscience before it is
        time to write again, but in looking backward over a whole year we can
        recall many things which have happened, - some glad, some sad, some
        joyful and some sorrowful. I think tho', as I look over it all, it has
        been a beautiful year and I am thankful for the blessings it has given
        me. Right here I am reminded of some lines we used to sing, and they
        apply to the most of us.

        If we are not going out into the world doing big things, we can do much

        When I wrote last March, <a href="BuckMyra1884.html">Myra</a> and her
        little <span wc_id="I938">son</span> were with me. This month they came
        again, surprising me. We had a good two week visit.

      <p>
        Last July <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">George</a> came for me and I
        was with them for some time. Northern New Jersey is a beautiful spot,
        over which we too many drives; then we had a long and delightful ride
        up the Hudson to Bear Mountain. I had read about the wonderful new
        bridge there, but never expected to see it; we crossed it, enjoying the
        grand view, both up and down the river. We went up the river as far as
        West Point, gong into the famous old Chapel where we looked as long as
        we cared to at those exquisite memorial windows, the old fashioned
        pews, etc. We then came back to the bridge, crossed over and came down
        the East side of the river, staying over night at Waterbury. I hardly
        think it was intentional on George's part, but we ran into a big prize
        fight there. The town was entertaining 20,000 visitors, so we could
        hardly find a place to sleep. We rode all the next day, reach-

        ing home about midnight, - pretty tired, but it had been worth while,
        for where can one find more beautiful scenery than going up and down
        our lovely Hudson Valley from West Point to New York. I am talking as
        though none of you have been there. While I do not doubt that many of
        you have, it was new and thrilling to me and I felt while there I'd
        like to tell everybody all about it.

        I then went over to Myra's and we conceived the idea of going to
        Gettysburg. It was a pleasant July morning and as we rode mile after
        mile over those grand old Pennsylvania hills, I felt as though I had
        never half known my native state. Of the real battle field I will not
        speak, as it is now a National Park and everyone goes there. It is far
        better seen than described. Just as we were about to leave I stood by
        the place where one of our Generals had stood, watching the battle; my
        attention was called to a man standing there We spoke of how visitors
        were coming in from all over the United States to this place. He said
        "I live in St. Petersburg". Of course I asked him if he knew <a href=
        "CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a>, - he said he did know Tommie,
        <span wc_id="I1693">Curt Shewman</span>, and he even had kept his car
        in Curt's garage. I thought, well, the world is not so large after all.
        In September, Myra and family brought me home, stopping in Marshall
        Falls, we saw the place as well as the folks<sup>3</sup>. We also
        stopped over night at Johnson City and had a very pleasant visit in
        <span wc_id="I1591">Ed</span> and <a href="HookerEva1885.html">Eva
        Hills</a>' lovely little home<sup>4</sup>. I thought then I was home
        for the rest of the year, but the children wrote for me to come and
        spend the holidays with them, so away I started again. We has a family
        dinner at George's on Thanksgiving Day, - then the next Saturday
        evening George, <span wc_id="I927">Anna</span>, and I had the pleasure
        of being guests at <span wc_id="I1605">Doris Selph</span>'s wedding. It
        was a beautiful wedding and a sweet little bride. <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Will</a> seemed pleased to have two of his old
        Cousins there, <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Ann Owlett</a> and myself.
        We surely enjoyed being there On Christmas morning, George, Anna, and
        the boys and I drove to Myra's, one hundred miles; we arrived in time
        for dinner and a Happy Christmas.

        On January 16th, I came home to Watkins. There is one more important
        event I want to mention and that is the "Cousins Dinner" at Cousin
        <span wc_id="I1470">Will</span> and <a href=
        "TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie Clark</a>'s. Everything had been
        perfectly planned and we had about as near a perfect time as we can
        here on earth. The cold snowy day did not seem to effect our spirits,
        and I think it was seventeen who had stayed over that gathered at
        <a href="SeelyAda1858.html">Ada</a>'s in the evening. We were all
        saddened at the news that <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">Mary
        Shipman</a> was in the hospital, and we missed the five

        looks like it's been cared for - wbt.

        I am busy here at my home in Watkins. I want to know what is going on
        in the world and I want to have a hand in some things I am interested
        in.
