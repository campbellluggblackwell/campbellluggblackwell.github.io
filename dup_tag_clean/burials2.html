      "reunion2012.html">Campbells of Nelson Reunions</a>) would be interested
      in visiting the graves of their relatives. To help with this, we have
      created a list of <span style=
      "font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">all</span> our known
      burials, domestic and foreign. It's sorted by:<br></big>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>

        <big>Cemetery</big>

    Enjoy the <big><a href="CemeteriesByState.html" style=
    "font-weight: bold;">burials list</a></big>, we hope it's useful.&nbsp;
    Additions and corrections are welcome, see our <span wc_id=
    "unknown">tree</span> for contact info. If a deceased descendant of our
    Campbells, Luggs or Blackwell's (or their spouse, father-in-law, or
    mother-in-law) is not shown, please send us their burial info.<br>
    <br>
    <big>VOLUNTEERS</big><br>
    Volunteers are needed to help add the burial lot info. Anyone reading this
    page has the necessary skills. I'll give you the URLs for looking up the
    data. I could do it all myself, but I have a lot of other things to do, and
    this is an easy way for you to help out with this web site. Your assistance
    will be appreciated and you will be given credit for your help. See our
    <span wc_id="unknown">tree</span> for contact info.<br>

    We also need volunteers to serve as guides for tours of cemeteries near
    Nelson, PA. Out of the area visitors to our Campbell Reunions often want to
    visit local cemeteries. Our reunions held in even numbered years, usually
    in August. Therefore it's not a big demand on your time. Cemeteries
    visitors want to see include: Nelson Cem.; Lawrenceville's Powers Cem.,
    Elkland's Highland Cem.; Osecola/Fairview Cem.; Knoxville's Riverside Cem.;
    Farmington Hill Cem.; & Steuben's Baxter Hill Cem.<br>
