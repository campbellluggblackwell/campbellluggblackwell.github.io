      Frances "Frank" Viola Goodrich was born Aug. 1, 1871, in Howard Co., IA,
      reportedly in a covered wagon on the way back to IL after a drought ended
      her Civil War veteran father's attempt at homesteading. She died 1958, in
      Binghamton, NY. Married Dec. 12, 1890 in Nelson, Tioga Co., PA to
      <a href="HoytJosephD1860.html">Joseph DeForest Hoyt</a>, b. Dec. 14, 1860
      in Farmington Twp., Tioga Co., PA; d. Mar. 14, 1903 in Nelson. Joe's
      parents were <span wc_id="I1246">William Hoyt</span> born in 1832 PA, and
      <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">Phebe Campbell</a>, born in 1832 in
      Nelson.
    </p>
    <p class="western">
      Frances' parents were Rev. <span wc_id="I978">Henry David Goodrich</span>
      (called "H.D."), b. 1844 in Davenport, Delaware Co., NY, and <span wc_id=
      "I979">Elizabeth Batterham</span> (pronounced "bat-trum"), b. 1847 in
      IL.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="western">
      Joseph and Frances Goodrich Hoyt had 3 children, all born in Nelson:<br>

      When Joe Hoyt dropped dead of "apoplexy" (a heart attack?) while working
      in fields he rented near the Nelson school, the family lost their own
      farm, which adjoined that of Joe's sister, <a href=
      "HoytInez1871.html">Inez HOYT</a> Boller, and were destitute. Frances and
      her daughters moved in with her parents. But Rev. Goodrich was retired
      and the space and his finances were strained. Inez eased the strain by
      taking the eldest daughter, Jessica, and raising her. Frances was able to
      support herself and her children, because her brother, <span wc_id=
      "I977">David Z. Goodrich</span>, came to the rescue by sending her to NY
      to be trained as a seamstress.<br>
      <br>
      It's a sad story. Dave worked for Campbell Cousin <a href=
      "SeelyMarcus1847.html">Mark Seely</a> and was engaged to his daughter,
      <span wc_id="I976">Lena</span>. The expense of Frances' training required
      Dave and Lena postponing their wedding for a year. Dave and Lena did
      marry, but Dave died within a year.<br>
      <br>
      But the training he paid for enabled Frances to get a job as a seamstress
      for Izard's department store in Elmira, NY and support herself and her
      two youngest daughters.<br>
      <br>
      After her daughters all married, she had no home of her own, but rotated
      staying with each daughter part of the year.<br>
      <br>
      She had a number of strange superstitions. When playing cards (which she
      loved to do), if she wanted to change her luck, her last resort was to
      get up, walk around the table three times, and then sit on her
      handkerchief.
