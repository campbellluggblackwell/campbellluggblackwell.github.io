        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I received a letter from Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will
        Selph</a> asking me to write a letter for the Cousins Correspondence. I
        became interested in the Cousins Letters through reading the books
        which my mother has.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am living on the farm where I was born, the <span wc_id="I722">O. A.
        Van Dusen</span> farm in Farmington <span class=
        "Annotation">[Twp]</span>. I have three boys <span wc_id=
        "I1414">Hugh</span>, eighteen years of age, who lives with my mother,
        <a href="TubbsAnn1855.html">Ann Van Dusen</a>, at Osceola, and attends
        school at Elkland, and <span wc_id="I1416">George</span> and
        <span wc_id="I1430">Wallace</span>, fourteen and twelve years
        respectively, who live at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our family has been bereaved by the death of our brother, <span wc_id=
        "I1448">Ross</span>, who left us on December 1, 1924, after he had been
        ill with meningitis for but a short time. It was he who sent the letter
        for our family last time. His <span wc_id="I1449">widow</span> and two
        daughters live in the home which they had just completed at Elkland.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am glad that this generation is to be included in the Cousins
        Correspondence. It will help us to get better acquainted.
