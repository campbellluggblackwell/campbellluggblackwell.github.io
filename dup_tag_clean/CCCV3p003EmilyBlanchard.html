        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Cousin <span wc_id="I1505">Roswell Young</span>'s letter just came, and
        I am going to sit right down and start my letter to the Cousins. I
        intended to do so when <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will</a>'s
        letter came, but things have been crowding in so fast this winter that
        time has gone more rapidly than I realized.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have had a very unusual winter. February, usually our worst month,
        was comparatively warm. Our worst storm came the last two days of
        February, and March "came in like a lion", continuing cold and raw ever
        since. According to the older residents Pittsfield has a climate all
        her own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last November <span wc_id="I992">Marcus</span> had diphtheria and, of
        course, we were quarantined for about three weeks. He recovered,
        apparently in perfect condition, and it has sometimes seemed to us that
        he is stronger than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I988">Charles Jr.</span> has been well all winter, and has
        skated and hiked and skied, and this spring he has joined the Y.M.C.A.
        where he gets gymnastics and swimming and all sorts of interesting
        things. Marcus will join him when he is old enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        The past two weeks we have been having papering and painting and
        various things done, which has kept us in a state of terrible disorder.
        The workmen have gone now, and I can get things back on a properly
        running schedule at my leisure. I shall keep right on with my spring
        cleaning, so I shall be busy for some time to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        These spring days begin to make us think about summer and what we shall
        do when the weather is warm and we can get out to enjoy it. Usually we
        plan on a trip to Pennsylvania, but this year I am trying to get my
        people to come here instead. They haven't said that they will come, but
        I am making my plans for them just the same, for I think they will come
        if they can. There are lots of lovely things to do here in warm
        weather, and I hope they decide to come.
      </p>

        Cousin Roswell says we are to be favored with letters from several more
        cousins whom Cousin Will has succeeded in locating. It lends quite an
        air of mystery to the new book - wondering who they are, and where he
        found them. And it has
