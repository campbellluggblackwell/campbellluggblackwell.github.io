        2. John Chauncey Congdon, Sr., b, 1848 in Nelson, PA, died 1911 in
        Brainerd, MN. He was a son of Geo. Wickham Congdon, who was a brother
        of <span wc_id="I917">Benjamin Docray Congdon</span>. Many of the
        reunion attendees would have known John Congdon from his years livng n
        Nelson.

        3. Probably <span wc_id="I1636">Charles Blackwell Campbell</span>.

      <p>
        4. Not sure which James Blackwell this was. It could have been
        <span wc_id="I2733">James Blackwell</span> who was a Blackwell history
        buff and at that time lived in Morris Twp., Tioga Co., PA. But I
        suspect it was <span wc_id="I2783">James Delos Blackwell</span> who
        lived in West Burlington Twp., Braford Co., PA. James D. and his branch
        of the Blackwells attended our Campbell reunions frequently.
