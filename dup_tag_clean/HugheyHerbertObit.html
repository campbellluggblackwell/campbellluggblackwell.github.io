      "HugheyHerbert1857.html">Herbert C. Hughey</a>, a cousin of Henry and
      Andrew Hughey of Sugar Hill, Frank Waugh of County Line, Emmett Love and
      Mrs. <a href="CongdonEmma1848.html">Emma</a> (Jabe) Buck of Watkins, died
      March 29th last at his farm home near Brainerd, at the age of 65. Mr.
      Hughey was related to Mrs. Buck on his mother's side and has many
      relatives in Tioga and Potter counties, Pennsylvania<br>
      <br></font> <font face="Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Herbert
      C. Hughey was a son of Daniel and <a href=
      "CampbellElizabeth1830.html">Elizabeth Campbell</a> Hughey. Daniel was a
      brother of Robert, a well-known citizen of Schuyler County, long since
      deceased, and of Joseph Hughey now of Sugar Hill. The family has been
      prominent in this county for nearly a century. The parents and elder
      children emigrated from Ireland as early as 1814.<br>
      <br></font> <font face="Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Herbert
      was born on Sugar Hill in 1857. His parents moved to Nelson, Tioga
      county, Pa., in the middle sixties. Herbert went to Brainerd, Minn., in
      1879 and his parents followed a year or two later. At Brainerd he worked
      in the Northern Pacific shops as a carpenter and later acquired a
      valuable farm in Long Lake township seven miles from Brainerd.<br>
      <br></font> <font face="Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr.
      Hughey spent a year in San Francisco, shortly after the great fire,
      engaged in the work of rebuilding that stricken city. He left the farm
      that year in the hands of his family which consisted of a most estimable
      <a href="BixbyHannah1863.html">wife</a> and four children, now all grown
      up and very capable. <span wc_id="I1204">Carrie</span>, (Mrs. W. L.
      Taylor), lives at Deerwood, Minn.; <span wc_id="I1222">J. Edgar</span>,
      is a prosperous farmer of Roy, Montana; <span wc_id="I1234">Harry</span>
      runs the home farm and <span wc_id="I1244">Mary</span> teaches at
      Dickinson, N. D.<br>
      <br></font> <font face="Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr.
      Hughey was a member of the Presbyterian church. At one time Harry was
      seriously considering entering the ministry but thus far home duties have
      prevented. The traditions of his forefathers have been well followed in
      the family or Herbert C. Hughey.</font><br>
