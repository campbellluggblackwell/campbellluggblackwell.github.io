        Dear Cousins:

      <p>
        As I review the past months since I last wrote you there seems nothing
        of much interest to tell you about. Undoubtedly many of you know I have
        disposed of our former home here and am now occupying a four-room,
        heated apartment. Certainly this is a great change, but I rather enjoy
        it. One pleasant feature is that I am not more than fifteen minutes
        walk from my son <span wc_id="I1482">William</span>'s home, and only a
        block our of his way to business. As I have continued my work at the
        office, it makes it very nice for me as he comes for me in the morning
        and we return together at night.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1478">Harry</span> and family have spent the winter in
        Paris, and there is a possibility they will remain in France another
        year. J. Harry Campbell was married to <span wc_id="I1479">Catharine
        DeWitt Chambers</span> of Port Jefferson, N. Y, September 17m 1913,
        They have two children, <span wc_id="I1480">Catherine Sebring
        Campbell</span><sup>1</sup> born May 10, 1915 and <span wc_id=
        "I1481">Jane Mather Campbell</span><sup>1</sup> born April 19, 1917.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1482">William S. Campbell</span> was married to
        <span wc_id="I1483">Winifred Tobey</span> of Elmira, N. Y., April 15,
        1914. They have one son, <span wc_id="I1484">Wilfred Sebring
        Campbell</span>, born August 26, 1916.

        Well, Cousins, it is a pleasure to hear from you all as it recalls many
        good times some of us have been favored to enjoy together.
      </p>
      <p>
        With very best wishes to you all.
