      <big>Sarah CAMPBELL Hazlett (1777 - 1824)</big><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>Sarah, called "Sally", was born Jun. 13, 1777, in Scotland or North
      Ireland; d. Nelson, PA. She married <a href=
      "HazlettSamuel1780.html">Samuel Hazlett</a>, b. 1780 in
      Scotland.<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>She was the eldest of 8 children of <a href=
      "CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph Campbell</a>, b. 1748, in Scotland, d.
      1824 in Nelson, Tioga Co., PA (originally called <a href=
      "BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's Island</a>); and <a href=
      "HarperMary1749.html">Mary Harper</a>, b. 1749, in Scotland, d. 1844 in
      Nelson.<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>Sally's youngest brother <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James</a>
      was born in N. Ireland, but it's uncertain whether the older children
      were born in Scotland or N. Ireland. While in N. Ireland, they lived in
      Derry (if you're Irish) or Londonderry (if your English or Scottish), and
      in Country Antrim. Sally's parents, and his youngest siblings, sailed
      from Londonderry to Perth Amboy, NJ in 1810 and arrived in Nelson early
      in 1811.</big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>We're not sure when Sally and Sam married, nor when they came to the
      US. There's a tradition that they were married aboard the ship, but no
      solid evidence. But we know their eldest child, Archibald, was born in
      Lancaster Co., PA in 1803. By 1806, they were living on a farm Sam bought
      near Stroudsburg, PA (which then was in Northampton Co., but now is in
      Monroe Co.) Sam started buying land on the north bank of the Cowanesque
      River, just east of what became the Boro of Nelson, Tioga Co., PA, from
      an early (but only stayed briefly) settler, Daniel Strait. He completed
      the purchase in 1810. At time it was wilderness, with no roads and only a
      few scattered cabins.<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>Sally's father and her uncle <a href=
      "CampbellJohn1761.html">John</a> bought the island from the Beechers, who
      moved away. Their property was on the south bank of the Cowanesque River.
      It was slightly west of the land on the north bank that Sam bought. Sam
      was the older brother of <a href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John
      Hazlett</a>, who married Sally's sister, <a href=
      "CampbellJane1792.html">Jane</a>. Sam and Sarah came to the US before
      Sally's parents and, according to Munsell's <span style=
      "font-style: italic;">History of Tioga Co.</span>, had a farm near
      Stroudsburg, PA, before Sam bought the Daniel Strait farm in
      Nelson.<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>Sarah and Sam had 7 children, but 3 died in infancy and may not have
      been named. Those that survived were:<br></big>
