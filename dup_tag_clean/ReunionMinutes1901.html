        1. As is so often the case with oral histories, by the time these
        stories reached Charley they had gotten rather jumbled. The dates,
        acres, dollars and some names are not right. For other accounts of the
        "English Company" see John F. Meginness; 1892 <span style=
        "font-style: italic;">History of Lycoming Pennslyvania</span> <a href=
        "http://www.usgennet.org/usa/pa/county/lycoming/history/Chapter-46.html">
        chapter 46</a>, or this <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Township,_Lycoming_County,_Pennsylvania">
        Pine Twp. excerpt</a> or <a href=

      </p>

        2. Joshua Blackwell married Rev. Hay's daughter, Amelia. Apparently
        Joshua and Amelia became Ann Clinch's foster parents and raised her
        until she married.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Charley was mistaken about this.&nbsp; Miss Sarah Lugg was never
        "Mrs. Lugg". She married Thomas Clinch Mar 27, 1803 in Avening,
        Gloucestershire and had daughter Ann before sailing to America. She
        married 2nd Enoch Blackwell Sept 9, 1805 in Jersey Shore, Lycoming Co.,
        PA.&nbsp; And 3rd to John Campbell, 1818 in Lycoming Co. or Tioga Co.,
        PA.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. He had a father named Joseph Campbell and a son named Joseph
        Campbell. So he was known as "Jr" while his father was still living,
        and called "Sr" by some after his father's death.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Charley calls his dad "Enoch Jr." His dad had an older half-brother,
        also named "Enoch Blackwell," bur the latter died young.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Other accounts have Enoch falling into Pine Creek while trying to
        clear a jam of logs they were floating down that strem.

      <p>
        7. Children.
