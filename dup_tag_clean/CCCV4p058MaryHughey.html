        Dear Campbell Cousins:-

    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I hope I am not too late with my addition to the "book of letters". I
        have been fighting a severe cold for nearly three weeks and have not
        felt a bit like writing a letter that would go in print and be read by
        so many relatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never dreamed that my plans would take the turn they did this past
        year. I signed up to go back to Minneapolis to teach and expected to
        take my <a href="BixbyHannah1863.html">mother</a> with me. <span wc_id=
        "I1234">Harry</span> had us all believing that he was taking in another
        housekeeper on a life contract and then he changed his plans. I was
        getting so "schoolteacherish" and cranky that the folks thought a year
        at home would do me good, so I changed my plans, too, and got released
        from my contract. Mother, Harry and I have enjoyed being together on
        the farm.
      </p>
      <p>
        In November I called the girls in the neighborhood to my home one
        Saturday afternoon and we organized a club which has steadily gained in
        popularity, numbers, and recognition outside of our community. We call
        ourselves 'The Daughters of the Soil". Our Program is increasing all
        the time. At present we are trying to work out an honor system similar
        to that of the well know Camp Fire Girls. We are planning a "Mothers
        and Daughters" banquet for the eighth of May to which every mother in
        the neighborhood is to be invited. If everyone comes we will have
        forty-five mothers and daughters to be served. I am going to repeat our
        object to you for I think it is worth while and some of you may be
        interested.

        Article II of our by-laws reads:
      </p>
      <p>
        "The purpose of this Society shall be to stimulate, promote and
        encourage the growth of the deepest and best desires of each member. A
        better working knowledge of all things cultural will be aimed at. Where
        possible any special talent of any member will be given an opportunity
        for expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        The activities shall not be limited but at all times shall be in
        compliance with the immediate interests of the Club members and shall
        be decided upon by&nbsp; majority vote of members present at any
        meeting of the Society.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main object of this club shall be to influence its members, the
        community in which it exists, and, it is hoped, the surrounding
        communities as well to appreciate the

        status of the farmer and, because of this appreciation, t proudly enter
        into a rural program which shall attract and maintain within rural
        communities a leadership which heretofore has gone out, over eighty
        percent strong, to the city places to the detriment of rural
        communities, but to the decided advantage of urban communities."

        I won't elaborate on the rural problem, although it is a subject I am
        vitally interested in, but if any of the Cousins lives in a rural
        community where there are several girls and would be interested in
        starting something among them, I will be most happy to send a copy of
        our by-laws to that Cousin and tell more about our club, which I think
        is doing something toward solving the rural problem. The entire
        neighborhood has been having "get-together" meetings once a month and
        we have had some fine programs.

        The women are organized into a home demonstration project club. At
        present we are studying the clothing project under the direction of a
        home demonstration agent from the State University. You see we are
        busy. Then I have only told you part of our activities. All winter I
        have been giving the young people a Bible course on Sunday afternoons
        following "A Beginners Course in Bible Study" by McConaughy. Harry has
        been interested in promoting some dairy meetings which have been held
        in our town hall. I am newspaper correspondent for our community. I
        think I have told our outstanding activities. Lately I have been
        assisting our County Superintendent of Schools in her office. I enjoy
        that immensely.
      </p>
      <p>
        We greatly enjoyed a visit from "<a href=
        "CongdonCharles1856.html">Cousin Charlie</a>" this winter. He never
        forgets us even though we are a bit out of the way, as Brainerd is not
        on the main line of the Northern Pacific any more.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has taken me five days to get this letter written so I think I had
        better send what I have without further delay.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a copy of Aunt <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Jane Tubbs</a>'
        <a href="CCCV4p088HistoryCampbells.html">Family History</a> which was
        read at the Campbell Reunion in August, 1901; also another paper by her
        called "<a href="MemoriumClinchAnn1804.html"></a>Mother's Memoir". I
        would be only too glad to make copies of these papers for the C.C.C. if
        they are wanted. These papers were sent to my <a href=
        "CampbellElizabeth1830.html">grandmother</a>.<sup>1</sup>

        1. Those items appear later in Vol 4. In addition, Mary wrote an
        autobiography which is being turned into HTML and well be added to this
        web site's "Documents" section.
