    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KNOXVILLE, Sept. 18. --- The social event of the season
    and of the last week was the marriage of Miss Mary Campbell, daughter of
    <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">T. C. Campbell</a> to Mr. B [sic] Shewman
    of Beaver Dams, N. Y., which took place in the Presbyterian church on
    Wednesday at one o'clock. The ceremony was performed by the pastor, Rev. C.
    Woodward. The church was handsomely decorated, and every seat was filled.
    After the ceremony came the dinner, at which one hundred and fifty guests
    sat down. Many relatives and friends from the West were present. The
    presents to the bride were elaborate and numerous. The happy couple left on
    the evening train for central New York, with the usual amount of rice and
    oldshoes added.<br>
