        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I find the time has arrived fro the Cousins letter, and I am sure we
        are all anxious to get our letter in the mail.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Spring has come. The robins are singing this morning. I am always glad
        to be alive these days.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had a fine winter. I spent nearly seven weeks at Nelson with
        <a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">Mark</a> and <span wc_id=
        "I973">Sue</span>, and also seven at <a href=
        "http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Asaph&amp;state=PA">Asaph</a> with
        <span wc_id="I453">Mahlon</span> and <span wc_id="I454">Heloise</span>.
        The time passed more rapidly that when at home <u>all alone</u>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mahlon is working in the Wellsboro <span class="Annotation">[RR]</span>
        Station at present but they still live at Asaph.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been very well this winter, -- much better than last.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        We will soon be making gardens and how I do enjoy seeing things grow,
        especially the vegetables which I can for winter use<sup>1</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish we might get a visit from some of the western
        people<sup>2</sup>, -- there are so many of our Cousins who are
        strangers to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want the Cousins to know that if they will come, there is a welcome
        awaiting them.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Love to all.
