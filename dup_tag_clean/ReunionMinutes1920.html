      <p>
        The twenty-eighth annual Re-union of the Campbell Family was held at
        Nelson Thurs. Aug 26, 1920. (It was proven to us by <span wc_id=
        "I1057">Laura Mourie</span> at this meeting that the first one was held
        in 1892 instead of '93)<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The day was fine and sixty-five members assembled to greet each other
        and renew acquaintances Because of the convenience of tables and seats
        and dishes the dinner was held in the Grange Hall after which the
        Program was given in the I. O. O. F. Hall that we might have the use of
        Piano.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pres. <span wc_id="I1896">Clyde Campbell</span> presided with
        <span wc_id="I2369">E. C. Blackwell</span> acting as Sec.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Campbell Reunion Song<sup>2</sup> was sung, followed by prayer by
        <a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">M. B. Seely</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then all united in singing Auld Lang Syne. Then minutes of last meeting
        were read by Sec. and friends read letters from <span wc_id="I1675">T.
        D. Baldwin</span>, <span wc_id="I488">James Ellison</span>, and
        <a href="CongdonEmma1848.html">Mrs. J. L. Buck</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pres. appointed as Revision Commit. of mailing list <span wc_id=
        "I685">J. E. Hazlett</span> and E. C. Blackwell.
      </p>
      <p>
        Officers elected were <span wc_id="I1707">James M. Parks</span>, Pres.
        and <span wc_id="I1708">Mrs. Parks</span> Sec. and Treas. Impromptu
        talks were given by several present. <a href=
        "CampbellKate1853.html">Mrs. E. S. Horton</a> read a Poem "Solace"
        written by <span wc_id="I1877">Maude Campbell</span> Miner and
        <span wc_id="I835">Jessie Campbell</span> Ellison twenty-five years ago
        for a similar occasion but not read at that time. As the writers are
        both no longer with us, their message was listened to with deepest
        interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I973">Mrs. M. B. Seely</span> recited some original verses
        she had written for the Re-union of six years ago but was unavoidably
        prevented from attending. The poem was much enjoyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sec. was instructed to write letters of sympathy to Mrs. Mary Beers
        and Mr. and <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">Mrs. Geo. Shipman</a>
        because advanced age of the former and ill-health in the latter family
        prevented their being with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Col. of $7.31 was taken and out of it $1.00 pd for I.O.O.F Hall $1
        for Grange Hall and 50 cts. for use of dishes. Also $1 for woman to
        clean up the dining hall.
      </p>
      <p>

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. All the records I have seen state 1893 was the first. Such as
        <a href="ReunionMinutes1893.html">1893 minutes</a>, <a href=
        "ReunionMinutes1894.html">1894 minutes</a>, and <a href=
        "ReunionProgram1894.html">1894 invitation</a>. I don't know why Laura
        BOSARD Mourey became convinced the first Campbell Reunion was in
        1892.&nbsp; -wbt.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel SHIPMAN</a> Shaw wrote the
        words for that song.
