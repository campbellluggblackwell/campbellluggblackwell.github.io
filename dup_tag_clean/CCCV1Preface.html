        <span style="font-style: italic;">Campbell Cousins
        Correspondence</span>.</span><br>
        <br>
        Volume 1 of the Campbell Cousins correspondence was originally printed
        and distributed in 1922. As you will see in this printing, it was
        conceived, organized, and published by our third generation cousin,
        <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">William E. Selph</a> of the <a href=
        "CampbellJulia1845.html">Julia Campbell</a> family. The second printing
        is something of a modern miracle and is due largely to the efforts of
        two contemporary cousins, William B. Thompson and Thomas P. Zurflieh.
        By the miracle of today’s internet, Bill and Tom became aware of their
        common interest in Campbell ancestry and were able to collaborate to
        produce this volume.<br>
        <br>
        Bill Thompson, (of the <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">Phebe
        (Hoyt)</a> Campbell line) has done a great deal of research on our
        Campbell ancestors and miraculously, has possession of four
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Campbell Cousins
        Correspondence</span> volumes. He has been the initiator and driving
        force" behind this new printing and the computerization of the volumes.
        Bill wanted to make heritage available to other living cousins, so he
        began retyping the letters and sharing them with living cousins
        discovered via the internet. Both he and Sharon Zurflieh contacted
        genealogy hobbyist Eric Clinch to ask about <a href=
        "ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann Clinch</a>. (Eric lives in Australia and has a
        very interesting web site featuring his photography and writing
        [<span style=
        "font-style: italic; font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: medium;">as
        of Dec. 2012 it's <a href=
        "http://webspace.webring.com/people/pe/ericlnz/MainMenu.htm">http://webspace.webring.com/people/pe/ericlnz/MainMenu.htm</a></span>]
        At that time he didn't have data about her, but getting two inquiries
        about her in the same week led to putting Bill and Sharon in touch,
        sending her some of the letters, and an offer from her to help
        retyping. This in turn led to a visit by her dad, Tom Zurflieh, to
        Bill's home, and Tom's offer to scan the typed pages of William Selph’s
        volumes and reproduce them.<br>
        <br>
        Tom Zurflieh, being a Campbell cousin and having a considerable amount
        of computer graphics hardware and software eagerly volunteered to
        produce this printed version. Lots of scanning, restoration, and
        printing of the photographs by Tom and additional typing by Bill, led
        us to the present point. We plan to publish <a href=
        "CCCVolumes.html">volumes 1‑4</a> on the web as soon as our schedules
        permit. That version will have convenient cross‑indexes on-line search
        capabilities. There are an additional nine volumes, but the copies
        apparently are presently tied up in an estate and are not available.
        [<span style=
        "font-style: italic; font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: medium;">That's
        what we were told, but we have seen no verification.</span>]<br>
        <br>
        One of our goals has been to preserve the appearance of Will Selph's
        original volume. To this end we have tried to reformat the scans to
        match the original layout, format, typeface and photographs. Therein
        lies another modern miracle, for without computers, scanners, and
        digital printers we probably would never even attempted this task.<br>
        <br>
        There is something unique about having hard copy in your hands, where
        you can see the real dimensions, and look at your own pace, not
        depending on screens, keyboards, mice, vagaries if Internet response
        time - just sitting in your favorite chair or under your favorite tree.
        Errors were undoubtedly made when the original handwritten letters were
        typed in Will Selph's office (we assume) for mimeographing, and we may
        have introduced errors in our retyping and scanning processes. Best
        efforts have been made to supplement the letters with <span wc_id=
        "I1246">William Hoyt</span>'s copy of Munsell's <span style=
        "font-style: italic;">1883 History of Tioga county,
        Pennsylvania</span>, and other sources: histories of the Beecher's
        Island Presbyterian Church and of the Farmington Presbyterian Church
        prepared by Rhoda English Ladd about 1945; information from many
        cousins, and generous sharing of information from many
        genealogists.<br>
        <br>
        A valuable feature of this modern version is the genealogical data
        provided by Bill Thompson. Bill inherited the first four volumes of the
        Campbell Cousins Correspondence from his mother, but found it hard to
        make sense of all the references to people in the letters. Getting a
        genealogy software package as a present one Christmas provided the
        necessary framework. Starting with a Campbell Cousins genealogy chart
        prepared by Will Selph in 1924, and then adding the marriages, births,
        and deaths, mentioned in the four volumes, at last provided a simple
        method of keeping track of who was who, and decoding who "John" or
        "Sally" referred to. We have included Bill’s genealogical work in two
        appendices at the end of this volume. We encourage you, as you read the
        letters, to refer to the appendices in order to find out more about the
        people mentioned.<br>
        <br>
        It's unfair to mention only a few people, but special thanks must be
        given to Anna P. Lugg and Stella Blackwell for their many kindnesses,
        and to our cousins, Diane Owlett Pitts, Rieta Boyden, and Bob Kelley.
        Thanks to the many others we have not mentioned by name, but who shared
        data and ideas. Most of all we owe a permanent debt of gratitude to
        William E. Selph, who conceived the Campbell Cousins Correspondence
        Club in the first place, and made it a reality, with incredible effort,
        perseverance, and lots of his time and money. Without his foresight and
        hard work, we would not have the <span style=

        <big>Tom Zurflieh was born and raised in St. Petersburg, Florida. His
        great-grandfather and namesake, <a href=
        "CampbellThomas1856.html">Thomas C. Campbell</a>, having moved from
        Knoxville, PA to St. Petersburg in the 1920’s was responsible for Tom’s
        being a Floridian.<br>
        <br>
        The Zurflieh side of his family also migrated from Pennsylvania in the
        1920’s due mainly to Tom’s father, <span wc_id="I1697">Jason
        Zurflieh</span>, having pursued and married <span wc_id="I1696">Frances
        Shewman</span>. Frances was the grand daughter of Thomas Campbell and,
        with her parents and two brothers, came to Florida soon after her
        grandfather.<br>
        <br>
        Tom has a master’s degree in mechanical engineering and was a college
        engineering instructor for thirty‑eight years, specializing in
        engineering graphics. He has authored four college textbooks, one on
        technical mathematics and three on computer-aided graphics. He has had
        a lifelong interest in photography, at one period having a darkroom. He
        has won several awards for and has sold some of his work. He is
