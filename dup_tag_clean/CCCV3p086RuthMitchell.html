        Dear Campbell Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Here we are, most pleasantly located in the "Sunshine City" thanks to
        my <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Father</a>! He has bought a
        beautiful home on the North Shore for us to live in, and "<span wc_id=
        "I1704">Mitch</span>" is working in the office, trying to relieve Papa
        of some of his too numerous responsibilities; and besides doing that,
        not being able to divorce himself altogether from the theatrical
        world<sup>1</sup>, he is one-third owner and manager of a family motion
        picture venture. The other members of the firm are our brother-in-law,
        <span wc_id="I1693">Curt</span>, and Cousin <span wc_id="I1681">Ford
        Pratt</span> of Scranton, Pennsylvania. So far everything but an
        earthquake has happened to discourage the boys, but they have decided
        to keep trying until an earthquake comes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are enjoying our privilege of a warm climate. Have been bathing in
        the Gulf of Mexico today, and the boys, <span wc_id="I1705">Bob</span>,
        five and a half years old and <span wc_id="I1706">Bud</span>,
        four,--well you would simply have to see them to appreciate how much
        they enjoy it all. A world of sand and water just for playing!.
      </p>
      <p>
        I expect that <span wc_id="I1692">Mary</span> and Papa have written
        just the only things I can think to say, but please don't mind, for we
        are all too busy enjoying ourselves to write everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good bye and love to all,
      </p>

      <p>
        1. Before leaving Rochester, NY, he owned several movie theaters. His
        movie enterprise in St. Pete, which was segregated then, was outdoor
        showings of movies, with chairs, for "colored people."
