        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Undoubtedly all who have left their letters until these last few days
        of March are wishing they had taken time by the forelock<sup>1</sup>
        and written a few days earlier - during the sunshiny weather. Then,
        perhaps, Nature's smiles might have inspired something worthy of a
        place in the C.C.C. But on the other hand, I, at least, need the cold,
        grey weather as an excuse for the hurried, prosy letter which mine is.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I read the letters written by some of the preceding generation I
        find myself wondering if more than their share of literary ability was
        not given them, leaving us without any. Then I turn to a letter,
        written by one of my contemporaries, full of interest, and so ably
        written, that I decide the art of composition must be an individual
        gift, and that the fairy with this particular gift was not present at
        my christening. Nevertheless, I am just as glad of an opportunity to
        contribute my bit as though this letter embodied the essence of
        description, news, and interesting events as do some of the cousins!
      </p>
      <p>
        You must know that the life of a school teacher is not made up of
        particularly startling things, unless you count the answers ones gets
        from children with original ideas. These very often are surprising
        enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since my last letter I have neither been engaged nor married, neither
        have I had any operations or illnesses; and while single blessedness
        and excellent health may be gifts from the gods, they are really
        accepted facts which need little elaboration here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I might tell you of my sisters' respective families; but that subject
        will, I am sure, be amply, if not overwhelmingly, covered by doting
        <a href="GoodrichFrances1871.html">grandmother</a> and <span class=
        "Annotation">[great-]</span><a href="HoytInez1871.html">aunt</a>, to
        say nothing of their fond mothers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last summer I went to the Cortland Summer School of Physical Education,
        Cortland, New York, where I was fortunate enough to finish the course
        prescribed by the State Department.

        1. A "forelock" is the lock of hair that may fall over someone's
        forehead. Isabelle is personifying "time" as someone to be controlled,
        as a teacher might do back then, by grabbing his hair and marching him
        to the front (or back) of the classroom to stand in a corner or perch
        on a high stool. When my mother did that with her students in K - 3,
        instead of grabbing hair, she would grab an unruly student by the ear
        and twist it while marching them to their destination.

        As summer school attendance is no longer compulsory for me, I am
        planning to spend my vacation rusticating with <span wc_id=

        flivver<sup>2</sup>, I expect to take the exercise which I usually get
        in work driving Henrys<sup>3</sup>.

        to Binghamton at that time where we hope to have a reunion of our

        2. "Flivver" originally was used to refer to Model-T Fords. But by 1925
        it was used for any small, inexpensive car.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. The common nicknames for Model-T's were "Tin Lizzie" and "Leapin'
        Lena." But here, Isabelle apparently is using "Henry" to refer to any
        of Henry Ford's car models.
