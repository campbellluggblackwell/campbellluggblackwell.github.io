        Dear Campbell Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        The Campbell Cousins Correspondence Club has increased its membership
        to the extent of one new member all through the request of Cousin
        <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I have spent this year in the east, that part of the country that
        contains the greater part of the Campbell family, my acquaintance has
        been only with New England.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;Through the kindness of Cousin Will Selph and his family my
        acquaintances have grown considerably, for I have just returned from a
        ten day vacation spent at their home in Maplewood<span class=
        "Annotation"></span>. My vacation was a most enjoyable one since the
        trip to New York <span class="Annotation">[City]</span> was my initial
        one and it was also an introduction for me, to the editor of our
        Cousins Book.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are very nicely situated in Maplewood, New Jersey, which is but an
        hour from New York and is in the center of suburban life.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        With his office<sup>1</sup> as headquarters, I made my daily trips
        endeavoring to see the city. which I surely did and all on account of
        such an able guide.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, I was so impressed with New York that upon returning to
        school, I found a telegram awaiting me from the family to the effect
        that they would like to know if I was wel and why I did not write.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The folks write that winter is still very much with them so that I am
        to believe that climatically, this was a good year to spend away from
        home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just now I have all good intentions of entering Dartmouth College next
        year, perhaps, and if that is done, being about the youngest of my
        generation of Campbells, the last one will have reached the coveted
        age.
      </p>
      <p>
        I certainly hope this letter will find all the rest of the Cousins as
        well as our family is, and that it has not bored you readers.
