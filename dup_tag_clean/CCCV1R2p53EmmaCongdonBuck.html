          <font face="Courier, monospace"><font size="4">Dear Cousins:-<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am late, but it has been impossible to
          write sooner. <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Brother Charlie</a>
          says, when we claim we have no time to write, it is only our mental
          attitude but that is not true this time. Anyway, I hope the door will
          not be shut before I knock to hand in my letter<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to say many things this time
          for it has been a full four months to me. I was just busy up to July
          sixth when I went to <a href="BuckMyra1884.html">Myra</a>'s at
          Wenonah, N. J. I was with her family and in <a href=
          "BuckGeorge1877.html">George</a>'s home at Madison, N.J., back and
          forth till September 3rd, when I came home to Watkins.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I greatly enjoyed the summer for beside the
          pleasure of being with my children and grandchildren (the oldest just
          beginning High School and the youngest, Myra's little son, is six
          months old, such a dear, winsome, little fellow), it is delightful to
          be in and near those big cities,‑ to see the ocean and many other
          things new and fascinating to me.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brother Charlie used to say, Em has more to
          tell if she takes a trip to Corning than some would after visiting
          the World's Fair.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reaching home and going to the County
          Fair, the next thing was the Cousins' Dinner. To many of us, I
          believe, that is really the big day of the year. The day, September
          26th, was fine and all roads led to Mansfield, where Cousins
          Llewellyn and <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel</a> awaited us
          with everything ready for their guests. Nearly all the Cousins came
          and what joy to grasp their hands and look into the dear faces again.
          Some of the older ones had perhaps one more wrinkle and were just a
          little less vigorous in their manner,‑ felt the chilly morning a
          little keener,‑ but the smile was the same and the voices were
          cheerful and brave as ever,‑ not a whine to be heard. We missed
          <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a> and <a href=
          "SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a>, but hope they can come next
          time.</font></font>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While in New Jersey, I with Charlie and
        George's family had a delightful visit at Will Selph's lovely summer
        home at Mount Tabor, N.J., so I saw them even though they could not be
        with us.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the time came to start for home, I am sure
        we all felt the day had been too short, but we hope we can all meet at
        Marshall Falls next year, where we can sing <a href=
        "CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie</a>'s songs to the music of the
        Falls. I am sure we were all glad to have <span wc_id="I948">Helen
        Congdon</span> with us. She was a fine representative of brother
        <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a>'s family.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myra and children are with me now for a month,
        and we are enjoying this wonderful October weather,‑ very thankful for
        all life holds for us. We are not looking for sorrow, but if it comes,
        we will bear it.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now, Cousins, for another six months,
        Good‑‑bye and God be with you.<br>
