      <p>
        The forty-seventh Annual reunion of the descendants of Joseph and Ann
        Clinch Campbell and all the Beecher Island clan was held on the lawn of
        <span wc_id="I2585">Robert Lugg</span> at Nelson, Pa. Aug 17 - 1939
        about fifty being present.
      </p>
      <p>
        After dinner the meeting was called to order by the President
        <span wc_id="I1896">Clyde Campbell</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Sec'y</a>, owing to an accident was
        unable to attend and <span wc_id="I780">Mrs. Helen Ireton</span> acted
        as Sec'y.
      </p>
      <p>
        The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved.
      </p>
      <p>
        In view of the fact that so few were in attendance (about 25) the
        question of continuing or discontinuing the reunion was discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many letters were read from absent cousins expressing their desire to
        continue the reunion and it was decided, by vote, to continue the
        reunion for three more years, which will complete fifty years of annual
        gatherings.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I693">Mrs. Fannie Monroe</span> - chairman of the Program
        Committee called upon the following who responded, making a very
        interesting program.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="HookerEva1885.html">Mrs. Eva Hills</a> gave a fine original
        paper recalling many interesting incidents of the early reunions etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mrs. Fanny Monroe gave many fine poems and facts about the family.
      </p>
      <p>
        All were glad to have Cousin <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Kate
        Horton</a> read one of her splendid original poems and to be present at
        another reunion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who spoke in regard to continuing the reunions were <span wc_id=
        "I2541">Waldo Lugg</span>, <span wc_id="I1760">Harry Kemp</span>,
        <span wc_id="I1671">Myra Campbell</span>, Kate Horton, <a href=
        "TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie Clark</a>, <span wc_id="I981">Emily
        Seely</span> Blanchard & Eva Hills.
      </p>
      <p>
        A vote of thanks was given to Robert Lugg for the use of his home, to
        the retiring officers,<sup>1</sup> and to Fannie Monroe for a splendid
        program.
      </p>
      <p>
