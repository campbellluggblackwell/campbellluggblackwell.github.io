        This is Station F-H-B<sup>1</sup> of Washington, D. C., and Station
        W-E-S<sup>2</sup> of New York City, broadcasting stations of the
        Campbell Cousins Correspondence Club. You have just listened to a fine
        lot of letters from the Campbell Cousins from all parts of the United
        States, extending from old New England to the state of Washington and
        from California to Florida, with a goodly number of intermediate
        points, and with the added pleasure of a nice letter all the way from
        Paris, France. We trust you have enjoyed our broadcasting program. If
        so, we hope you will write a letter to our new Secretary, Miss <a href=
        "BosardFlorence1887.html">Florence Bosard</a>, #211 Tenth Street, N.E.
        Washington, D. C. Such letters will be duly appreciated and we trust
        that in April 1925 all members of the Campbell Cousins Correspondence
        Club will be ready and anxious to listen in again. Please stand by for
        further announcements later this year, at which time our Secretary will
        have some suggestions to make regarding our program for 1925.

        After considerable correspondence between the new officers and quite a
        number of other Cousins, it was finally decided that one exchange of
        letters between the Cousins each year would perhaps be better than two
        or more. With this thought in mind, April 15th<sup>3</sup> was finally
        decided upon as the date on which all letters from the various Cousins
        should be in the hands of the Secretary. You will at once observe that
        there is considerable improvement in the material submitted for Volume
        #2, -- but that we have reduced the expense of the binder<sup>4</sup>,
        paper, etc. Our desire has been to give the cousins just the finest
        kind of a real treat possible at a minimal outlay of expense. We are
        very glad indeed that more of the Cousins are taking advantage of our
        system or correspondence We have in reality brought out three exchanges
        of

      letters in about ten months, the first one being in June, 1923, the
      second one in October, 1923 and the third one in April 1924. Our first
      exchange of letters was participated in by twenty-three Cousins, the
      second exchange jumped up to forty-eight and now we have made still
      further advance by going to fifty-eight. This is indeed a fine record and
      only shows what can be done when we all pull together.

        Congratulations are due all of the Cousins for the fine letters they
        have written. There certainly seems to be an unlimited amount of talent
        along literary lines in the Campbell Clan once we get the cousins
        stirred up. We might, however, refer to Cousin <a href=
        "CongdonEmma1848.html">Em Buck</a>'s remark in the first paragraph in
        her <a href="CCCV2p046EmmaEBuck.html">letter</a> where she states that
        "our letters ought to be written carefully and thoughtfully, inasmuch
        as these letters will be read and re-read long after we are gone." We
        would like to suggest that each of the Cousins keep a special
        memorandum pad on which to write down little items of interest which
        would make nice reading, for the Cousins book. By adopting this method,
        all of the Cousins will find that it will be a very easy matter to
        write a most interesting letter when the time comes.

        superb, but more photographs should have been shown. Will all the
        Cousins please keep in mind the matter of photographs and whenever you
        are having a family gathering with all members of your family present,
        will you kindly take the trouble to have some photographs taken and
        sent in so that they may appear in the Cousins Book from time to time?

        Vice-president, Secretary and Treasurer at the beginning of this book.
        The writer is very glad indeed to have been able to secure the services
        of such a fine lot of second cousins<sup>5</sup> to take over the work
        of continuing our Correspondence Club. Our future success however, will
        depend very largely upon the interest which each Cousin manifests in
        our undertaking and we desire again to impress upon you one and all of
        the necessity of cooperating to the fullest extent.

        In the event of a change of address of any Cousin will you please take
        the trouble to promptly advise our secretary, Cousin Florence H.
        Bosard, 211 Tenth Street,N. E., Washington, D. C.? Just now we are in
        doubt as to the correct addresses of two or three Cousins whose letters
        are very much wanted to include in our present book.

    </p>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        The writer has been working for several weeks by means of
        correspondence and a questionaire <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>
        in an effort to bring out a genealogy chart<sup>6</sup> of the <a href=
        "CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph Campbell</a> Family which would be
        authentic and correct in every respect up to May 1st, 1924. The dream
        has been realized and it is hoped that sometime during the month of May
        you may receive such a chart, sent out to you with my complements. This
        chart will cover the genealogy of the first, second, third and fourth
        generations of the Joseph Campbell family, -- and it is hoped that the
        present officers of our Correspondence Club will within the next one or
        two years, by a system of Correspondence and questionnaires, take up
        the work of the chart where it leaves off and bring it up to date. It
        is suggested that as soon as you receive your genealogy chart you will
        immediately have it framed in order that the glass will prevent the
        chart from becoming mutilated, soiled, or injured in any way. One
        hundred of these charts will be prepared so that every first and second
        Cousin in the Joseph Campbell Family may have a copy and there will
        still be a few left over for future distribution.

        cost him a lot to produce. If you'd like one, copies of Will's Chart

      Such a chart is something we have longed to possess and now that we are
      to have it, it is hoped that each one will prize it highly. It will serve
      to answer many questions as to names, dates, places, etc., which in the
      past have sometimes been a matter of guesswork but with our charts for
      reference will now be automatic. It has, of course,m been assumed that
      all material sent in by the various Cousins has been correct. If such be
      the case, then the chart is absolutely correct<sup>7</sup>.

      <p>
        It is suggested that when your genealogy chart has been received, you
        will from it make up a list of your various Cousins, arranging them
        from January to December, according to dates. Would it not be a fine
        idea to occasionally send a post card pr letter to a Cousin whose
        birthday or wedding day is approaching? Yes! But how much cheer this
        would bring! Think it over, Cousins, and if the idea seems to be a good
        one, it is suggested that you adopt it.

      Notwithstanding the fact that our present Book has covered many more
      Cousins than our last exchange of letters, yet we seem never to be
      satisfied. We have purposely held the book open an extra week hoping each
      day that letters from more of the Cousins might be received. We have even
      sent out special hurry-up leters hoping thereby to give you more letters
      and a larger book. However, we are sure that the Cousins not writing this
      year will come back good and strong in 1925 and make up for lost time.
      Some of those whom we had fully expected to hear from are as follows:

      decided not to send out any bills whatever om connection with Volume #2,

      kindly draw and send a check for $4.00 payable to our Treasurer,

      <p>
        In connection with cthe item of expense, we wish to say that it is our
        firm desire that each one of our first and second Cousins should
        possess a copy of our Book of Letters, except possibly in cases where
        two or more Cousins are in the same home and where one Book would be
        amply sufficient. A little fund has been created to take care of the
        expense of any Cousin who does not feel able to pay for his or her Book
        and we do not want any Cousin to feel the least bit timid about
        receiving a Book on the above account, as provision has already been
        made to perpetuate our Correspondence Club, up to as many of the
        Campbell Cousins as will contribute letters for the book.
      </p>

        The writer did not write a regular letter for the Cousins Book as the
        Selph family seems to be pretty well represented already<sup>9</sup>.
        The wife has told you about the fine trip we had to Washington, D. C. a
        few days ago. Cousin <a href="CraneJennie1852.html">Jennie Bosard</a>
        and entire family certainly gave us a royal good time and one we will
        not soon forget. We only wish our stay could have been longer but the
        Campbell Cousins Correspondence Letters were coming into my office in
        every mail and it was necessary for me to be back on the job here in
        New York.
      </p>
      <p>
        In closing we certainly hope that every Campbell Cousin may live long
        and prosper and that the coming year may have in store for you all the
        good things you yourself had hoped for.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are as yet undecided about a trip in Tioga County this summer but it
        is more than likely that we will roll up there for a short visit just
        to see some of the dear faces once again.
