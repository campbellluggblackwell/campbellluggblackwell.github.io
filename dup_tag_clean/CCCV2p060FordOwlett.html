        Dear Cousins:
      </p>

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        It is with pleasure that I again write a letter for the Cousins report.
        There is not much news for me to write about as I am here alone in
        Knoxville.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Have been very busy this winter. While it has been a long winter, we
        did not have much snow and there was no ice harvested<sup>1</sup> here
        'til after February 1st.
      </p>
      <p>
        This spring seems a little late; it was only last night that I heard
        the peepers for the first time and the old saying is that they must
        freeze up three times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yesterday after church and after I had my dinner, I took the "Ford" and
        drove down home, -- got stuck in the mud but after a little effort got
        through all right and reached home. Found <span wc_id=
        "I1102">Father</span> and <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Mother</a>
        alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The boys<sup>2</sup> have been home most of this winter but springtime
        scatters them again. They have made some fine syrup<sup>3</sup> and
        sugar<sup>3</sup>. Mother says the best sugar season they have ever
        had.
      </p>
      <p>
        About Thanksgiving time when I had been down home I met Cousin <a href=
        "CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie Congdon</a> the train. He says the
        Cousins are coming to Stroudsburg for the Annual Dinner. I am sure that
        will be wonderful and I hope that it will be so that I cam meet with
        you all.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is with much pleasure that I have read the last report and I am sure
        this one will be just as interesting, though I may fall down on my
        part.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trusting this finds you all well and hoping for a bright and happy
        summer, I am.
