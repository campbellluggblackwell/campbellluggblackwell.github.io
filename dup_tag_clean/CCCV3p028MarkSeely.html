        Dear Cousins of the Campbell Family:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Greetings to one and all.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a> says it is time to
        write our annual letter. I wonder if he does not get tired and, perhaps
        a little disgusted, that he has to keep us posted as to when to write
        each time. Well, he is pretty good natured if he doesn't and that is
        the way I remember him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Will says "Write a bright, cheerful, newsy letter". Can you imagine any
        one being able to write a very newsy letter from the little town of
        Nelson? My life has been a very quiet, and to some, would seem a very
        dull life; but I think I have been too busy to realize it. When all is
        well in the store and house, I am very happy and contented.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess I was not intended to do big things. I have been very proud of
        my cousins, one and all. Some have seen much of the world, and from
        them I gain a knowledge of the world at large. Others have plodded on
        in much the same quiet way as myself, and from them I gain courage to
        go on and be contented. So each one plays his part in life, exerting an
        influence on all with whom he comes in contact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cousin Will has given us the pleasure of expecting to hear from some
        new members of the Cousin Clan. We are very glad, and extend a cordial
        welcome. We shall all be very sorry to miss Cousin <a href=
        "CraneJennie1852.html">Jennie Bosard</a>'s good letter, also Cousin
        <span wc_id="I1448">Ross Van Dusen</span>'s.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I981">Emily</span> and family are well, and doing well,
        and come home once a year with two nice grandsons, and that is always a
        bright spot in our lives. <a href="SeelyLena1873.html">Lena</a> is
        always with us, and though not very strong, is getting to be our "right
        hand man" in our old age.
      </p>
      <p>
        We shall look forward to the coming of the new Cousins Book with
        pleasure.
