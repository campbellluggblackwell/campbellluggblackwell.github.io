      <p>
        Yours of June 1st is at hand. I received the book and acknowledge same.
        Say, you do not know how I appreciate your kindness in making it
        possible for me to have one of those books. <a href=
        "CongdonCharles1856.html">C. H. Congdon</a> sent one to <span wc_id=
        "I1708">Em</span> and me to read, -- the first issue -- and we returned
        it. I appreciate <a href="SeelyJud1851.html">Jud Seely</a>'s
        thoughtfulness in giving my name as one to receive the Cousins Book of
        letters. But this time my wife was not present<sup>1</sup> with me to
        talk about the different composers of those letters, which keeps the
        chain of relationship together.&nbsp;<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I cannot comprehend the effort you have give to complete such a book. I
        take pride in showing it to some people who are capable of realizing
        the effort such an undertaking requires.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope you and your wife can make me a visit. My sister-in-law is
        keeping the house open and making it possible for me to have a home.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent three months last winter in Florida and California, but was
        glad to come back to my own home.
