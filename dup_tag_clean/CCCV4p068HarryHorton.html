        Dear Cousins:-

      <p>
        Another year has rolled around with little change in our home. The past
        winter has been an exceptional one for Baker, and it hardly seems
        possible that summer is nearly here with all of its joys before us.
        Being 3,500 feet up in the air we expect lots of zero weather and snow
        for five months at least, but this winter I have shoveled my 200 feet
        only once and the girls skates have rusted on the hook. There is lots
        of snow in the mountains so we are assured a goodly amount for
        irrigation which is quite necessary to insure good crops for the
        farmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are enjoying a visit with <span wc_id="I787">father</span> and
        <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">mother</a> and we are surely putting in
        full time for they inform us they will soon be on their way East and
        just at the time of year when we would like so much to keep them. Our
        fishing season opens on the 15th, which will find us up at our cottage
        on Wallowa Lake where father and I hope to hook into some of those big
        eight pound rainbows. Of course after his fishing experience in Florida
        this may be tame sport for him, but I am still willing to bet my money
        on the Oregon rainbow and steelhead as the King of all game fish.

        We are having considerable excitement in Baker over the finding of huge
        copper deposits about ten miles from this city. Eastern capital is now
        taking over one of the largest properties, and we are in hopes it will
        mean considerable to the future of our city.

        The State encampment of the Spanish-War Veterans are meeting with us in
        July, and as a member of the Executive Committee and Secy-Treas. of the
        affair my hands are about full. <span wc_id="I823">Helen</span>'s and
        my interest in the Spanish-War Veterans and the American Legion with
        their Auxiliaries keep us going, and with a reunion of Scottish Rite in
        April and October, believe fraternally we are doing our share.

        <span wc_id="I825">Jean</span> and <span wc_id="I826">Virginia</span>
        are busy with their school work and music, and <span wc_id=
        "I827">John</span> is getting to to be some boy. He will be six this
        fall and starting school, and we of course will lose our baby for they
        certainly d begin to grow up as soon as they begin school.

        I am so late with my letter that I am going to "Air Mail" it to New
        York. Our Air Mail service started last week so we feel we are on the
        map now.
