        Dear Cousins:-

      <p>
        It is with pleasure I am sure that my small contribution goes forward
        to join the other letters in making up this Cousins Book. A mighty fine
        thing that we can have so many nice letters bound in book form, so that
        in after years we have somewhat of a history of the doings of the
        Campbell family<sup>1</sup>. I am proud to know that I am one of them.
        While my knowledge of the family is limited to some extent and as an
        orator I am a failure, I do enjoy reading the wonderful letters the
        rest of you write. I read with a great deal of interest Cousin
        <span wc_id="I1551">Joseph W. Buck</span>'s <a href=
        "CCCV3p072JosWBuck.html">letter</a>; those items, as a bit of history,
        give us some idea of the way our forefathers lived and the problems
        they had to face.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have sat by the hour listening to <a href=
        "CampbellEleanor1828.html">grandmother</a> tell of her early life. The
        way they used to go for the cows and how they would get hold of a cow's
        tail, not daring to let go, for they could hear both wolves and
        panthers howling in the hills. How they went to Sunday school one
        morning they went a bear in the road and stopped and waited till it
        went into the brush and then they went on their way; not many of us
        have the courage they had in those days, though no doubt the little
        incidents that come into our lives would have looked just as great to
        them.<sup>2</sup>

        When the last letter was written I was just out of the hospital from an
        operation for Goitre, from which I have fully recovered, thanks to
        Providence, good care and Dr. <span wc_id="I1577">Ross Loop</span>.

        I received a very nice letter a short time ago from Cousin <a href=
        "CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie Campbell</a>, also an invitation to
        the Golden Wedding Anniversary. I am sure I should like to meet you all
        down there for it is a wonderful place and i know you would have a fine
        time.

        We are not doing much traveling around just now. You people who have
        improved roads to travel on don't now what you are missing where you
        start to drive five or six miles and get stuck in the mud knee deep and
        have to be pulled out.<sup>3</sup> The breaking up of winter makes the
        roads pretty hard to travel here in the country.

        1. It was indeed a fine thing that <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will
        Selph</a> did, creating the Campbell Cousins Correspondence Club.
        Without the bound volumes, distributed to more than 100 households, our
        family history would have been lost.

        2. Bears are much more common today in the Cowanesque Valey than they
        were in Ford's day. Perhaps as plentiful as in Eleanor's day. But no
        wolves or cougar.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Farmers still used draft horses, not tractors, so a team would be
        available to pull a car out of the mud, altho how far it could go
        before getting stuck again was a problem. The mud had been a problem
        for buggies and wagons too, but at least then they had horses they
        could ride instead and avoid the mud holes.

        It was my great pleasure to attend the Cousins Dinner last October with
        Cousin <a href="TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie Clark</a> and we had a
        fine time and we had the usual Campbell Dinner. <a href=
        "BosardAnna1860.html">Mother</a> left a few days later for Maplewood,
        N.J., where she spent some time with Cousin <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> and family and attended
        <span wc_id="I1605">Doris</span>' wedding. I have only seen her once
        since, - and that was at <span wc_id="I1128">Jessie</span>'s for
        Christmas Dinner (the Sunday before she went to Buffalo for Christmas)
        where she has been all winter. She is on her way back home now where
        <span wc_id="I1171">Mark</span> and his family keep the home fires
        burning.

      <p>
        Anxiously awaiting the Cousins book and a hope that I may meet with you
        next fall<sup>4</sup>, I am,

        that summer. Many of the folks who went to the Cousins Dinners did not
        go to the reunions.
