        My dear Cousins:-

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        It is with a great deal of pleasure that I send greetings to all of the
        Campbell Cousins and offer my bit for the fourth edition of the
        splendid Campbell Chronicle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since you have letters before you from <a href=
        "CampbellWilliam1864.html">Dad</a> and brother <span wc_id=
        "I916">Bill</span>, I am going to include in my offering, something
        relative to my own conquests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Known for these many, many years as one of those dyed-in-the wool
        bachelors, I have surprised everyone by reports of a feat I recently
        performed in Iowa I am happy to report to all of my kin that I will be
        a benedict<sup>1</sup> before our next letters are published. Miss
        <span wc_id="I909">Elizabeth Welch</span> of Cedar Rapids has promised
        to become a part of Clan Campbell during the early summer, and I am
        just as proud of it as all this sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enclosed please find hearty "hellos" and hand shakes for you all,
      </p>

        1. "Be a benedict" refers to Benedict Arnold. I.e. by getting engaged
        he became "traitor" to bachelorhood.
