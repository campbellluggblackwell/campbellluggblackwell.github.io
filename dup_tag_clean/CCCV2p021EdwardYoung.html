        My dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Recently I received a letter from our Cousin <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a>, extending to me the pleasure of
        writing a letter that would be sent to my Campbell Cousins through the
        medium of a very fine system of correspondence, the originator of
        which<sup>1</sup> I should like to congratulate. Considering the number
        of my Campbell Cousins and how few of them I happen to know, -- for me
        to write a letter to them is like a small boy writing to Santa Claus,
        whom he&nbsp; has never seen, but of whom he has heard a very good
        report of and who he is convinced is quite alright. I might add also
        that, like the small boy writing to St. Nick, I hope this letter will
        be favorably received.
      </p>
      <p>
        Probably like the rest of my Cousins, in reply to my Cousin's letter, I
        immediately asked what I should write about, and was told to write
        about myself. That isn't much to write about, but here goes:
      </p>
      <p>
        At present, I am living in that big city which has the reputation of
        being very wicked; that city in which our Cousin "W. E. S."<sup>2</sup>
        only deigns to carry on business.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an occupation, I am trying to give to the world a little more music
        and to prepare myself to do it better than I have as yet been able to
        do. That isn't very definite, is it? Well. to be a little more exact, I
        have been doing almost everything from playing on a leaky organ in
        church,(that makes a sound as though the big bass in the choir was
        taking a much needed nap while the minister raves about what a quiet
        and peaceful place Heaven is) to teaching young ladies how to hold
        their fingers at the piano and teaching young lads that a piano is a
        musical instrument and not an instrument of torture. I am at present
        enjoying immensely the direction of a choir just outside of New York. I
        hope my brother <span wc_id="I1532">Clifford</span> doesn't see what I
        said about that minister back there).

        Talking with different people back in Elmira [NY] I find that most of
        them have a rather hazy but none the less positive idea as to what a
        musician is really like. Since the subject rather interests me, permit
        me to say a few words about what I have observed of him. In the first
        place, he seldom has long hair anymore;(there are those who wouldn't
        think of him as a musician if he could afford a haircut.) In the second
        place, he often manages to eat three meals a day in modern times.
        Thirdly, many of them have respect for the law of the land and have
        heard that there is such a book ad the Bible. We are also proud to say
        that these musicians born in this country have known the benefits of
        compulsory education. No doubt you often see exceptions to the
        foregoing but these exceptions, being found in a profession where they
        feel the economic need of advertising, -- advertise the only thing they
        can, -- their freakishness.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I recall having spent a few very delightful days attending a reunion at
        <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie Campbell</a>'s at Knoxville. I
        so enjoyed those days that I still have a very vivid recollection of it
        all, -- especially the chicken dinner. I hope very much to have the
        opportunity of seeing those people soon again. Unlike my sister
        <span wc_id="I1501">Ethel</span> or brother <span wc_id=
        "I1505">Roswell</span> I am still unattached, so that if I had the
        chance to dance with some of the young ladies and those not so young at
        such an affair, I would have to invent my excuses. After engaging in
        professional work here in New York and meeting with all kinds of people
        it surely is nice to go back and see some of the gold Scotch Irish
        stock that isn't afraid to say what it thinks and usually does. Here's
        wishing them all health and happiness.
