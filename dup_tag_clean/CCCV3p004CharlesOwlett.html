        Dear Campbell Cousins:
      </p>

      <p>
        Well, as you have urged me to write, I'll try and say a few words.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a nice fat boy to add to your list of cousins. His name is
        <span wc_id="I1158">Charles Butler Owlett</span>. He was eight months
        old the twentieth of this month. <span wc_id="I1157">Marth <span class=
        "Annotation">[sic]</span> Ann</span> was four years old the tenth of
        February, but she doesn't walk yet<sup>1</sup>. However, she is gaining
        every day now, and we are hoping that she can walk before long.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have just attended church. Mr. Alty preached a wonderful sermon on
        the works of the Holy Ghost in the lives of men. I have been a little
        unfortunate this winter. Was out of work about three months, but
        business is picking up some now.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were all glad to see <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Mother Owlett</a>
        back home with us again after her Washington trip.
      </p>
      <p>
        Best wishes to all the cousins,
      </p>

        cared for all her life by her very dedicated mother.
