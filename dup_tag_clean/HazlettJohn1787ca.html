        <big>John Hazlett (abt. 1787 - bef. 1840)</big><br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <big>John was born abt. 1787 in Scotland (or possibly N. Ireland); d.
        before 1840 in Tioga Co., PA. On Apr, 4, 1811, in Nelson (originally
        called <a href="BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's Island</a>) he married
        <a href="CampbellJane1792.html">Jane Campbell</a>, b. 1792 in Scotland
        or N. Ireland (who was the sister of his brother Samuel's wife Sally).
        After Jane's 1832 death, John married <span wc_id="I699">Mahala
        Scott</span> (1805 - 1890).<br></big>
      </p>
      <p>
        <big>We don't know for sure when John came to America. Presumably he
        came with his older brother <a href="HazlettSamuel1780.html">Sam</a> .
        If so he was in Lancaster Co., PA before 1803. By 1806, Sam and wife
        <a href="CampbellSarah1777.html">Sally</a>, and presumably John, were
        living on a farm Sam bought near Stroudsburg, Monroe Co., PA (then in
        Northampton Co.)<br></big>
      </p><br>
      <p>
        <big>Sam started buying land on the north bank of the Cowanesque River,
        just east of what became the Boro of Nelson, Tioga Co., PA from an
        early, but temporary settler, Daniel Strait. At the time it was
        wilderness, with no roads and only a few scattered cabins. In 1810, Sam
        completed the purchase.</big>
      </p>
      <p>
        <big>Sam's <a href="CampbellJoseph1748.html">father-in-law</a> (who
        came to the US in 1810) and Jane's uncle, <a href=
        "CampbellJohn1761.html">John Campbell</a> (who came in 1776/77), bought
        the island from the Beechers, who moved away. That property was on the
        south bank of the Cowanesque River. It was slightly west of the land on
        the north bank that Sam bought.</big>
      </p>
      <p>
        <big>John's sister-in-law, and future wife, Jane Campbell, along with
        Jane's parents, and some of her younger siblings, sailed from
        Londonderry to Perth Amboy, NJ in 1810.<br></big>
      </p>
      <p>
        <big>John Hazlett moved from Stroudsburg to Beecher's Island as part of
        the "Campbell-Hazlett Expedition" that arrive early in 1811.<br></big>
      </p><big>We know John's father was named Robert Hazlett, but we knew
      nothing else about Robert, just his name. According to <a href=
      "CampbellJane1834.html">Jane CAMPBELL</a> Tubbs, after Sam and John
      settled in Tioga Co., Sam's mother, his sister Mary, and brother came to
      America --- settled in western PA. It's always been a mystery why they
      did that instead of joining Sam and John in Nelson.<br></big>
      <p>
        <big>Some researchers believe they have identified John's parents, but
        that the identification is uncertain.<br></big>
      </p>
      <p>
        <big>John and Jane Campbell Hazlett had 9 children, all born in Nelson,
        Tioga Co., PA:<br></big>
