        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        How soon a year passes! It seems but a short time since we received the
        last Cousins book of letters.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have had a cold winter with lots of snow. One day <span wc_id=
        "I1277">Roy</span> came home and said he heard a message going over the
        wire to a party in St. Petersburg, Florida, to the Campbell
        House<sup>1</sup>, We had about forty inches of snow at that time, and
        wished we were in the "Sunny South", but the nearest we got was Miama
        <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> Beach (on the radio).
      </p>
      <p>
        We have all been well this past year. <span wc_id="I1282">David</span>
        is thirteen months old and gets into all kinds of mischief.
        <span wc_id="I1278">Joseph</span> is in school and very much interested
        in trout fishing at present<sup>2</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last week we had company from Pennsylvania for the week-end. We are
        always so glad to see our old friends from "home".
      </p>
      <p>
        Had a letter from <span wc_id="I1595">Treva Hazlett</span> a short time
        ago asking if we couldn’t plan to come home for the reunion. We had
        planned to go in June as soon as Joseph is out of school, so I'm afraid
        that we shall have to miss the reunion again this year.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sincerely,

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. Roy was a freight agent for the DL&amp;W RR. Apparently he knew
        Morse Code and could translate the outgoing telegram as he heard it. He
        mentoned it to Betty because Campbell House was a hotel in St. Pete
        owned by Cousin Tommie Campbell.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Dave, like his dad, was an enthusiastic trout fisherman But Joe, and
        later Betty & Roy move to FL where the water's too warm for trout
        fishing. I'm not sure about Joe, but Roy switched to deep sea fishing
        after the move.
