        2. Frances read the poem for her sister-in-law because Lena was
        profoundly deaf as a result of scarlet fever in childhood.

        3.Slate Run is in Brown Twp., Lycoming. The 1910 census of Brown Twp.,
        has a William R. Campbell, but his Campbell line doesn't seem to be
        connected to ours.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. There was more than one Enoch Blackwell alive then. I'm not sure
        which one sang.
