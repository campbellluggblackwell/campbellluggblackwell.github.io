        Dear Cousins All:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1591">Ed</span> is in the Boston office every
        Wednesday<sup>1</sup> so on the two nights each week while he is away I
        try to accomplish some extra work such as letter writing (It's getting
        quite an effort with me.)<sup>2</sup> So tonight, March 17th, as I am
        listening to the good Irish music over the Radio I will commence my
        yearly contributions to the book in which I am very proud to have my
        signature.
      </p>

        During the past year much has happened to us in the way of pleasure.
        Our vacation trip in July, 1925, included Albany and Troy, (where we
        stopped a night with Clare Baxter Smith).<sup>3</sup> For Cousin
        <span wc_id="I1478">Harry Campbell</span>'s benefit I want to say she
        is just as pretty as he remembers her in Nelson as a girl<sup>4</sup>.
        She has two daughters, one a perfect picture of herself<sup>5</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the <a href="http://www.mohawktrail.com/driving-tours.html">Mohawk
        Trail</a> to Concord and Lexington where we stayed in the Mansion House
        of Revolutionary Fame. The reason we missed seeing Cousin <span wc_id=
        "I981">Emily Blanchard</span> was that I had understood she would be in
        Nelson at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Boston we tried to see the most important things. <span wc_id=
        "I1592">Junior</span> wanted to see where Paul Revere hung the
        lanterns<sup>6</sup> so he and Ed climbed the stairs in the <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_North_Church">Old North Church</a>. I
        stayed on the ground and read tomb stones.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        One night we visited friends in Swampscott near President Coolidge's
        summer home. I think I enjoyed the Vermont and New Hampshire scenery
        most of all. The trip along Lake Champlain was beautiful. We stopped at
        the Thousand Islands on our way home.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the summer Cousins <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommy</a>
        and <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">Frank Campbell</a>, <span wc_id=
        "I773">Llewellyn</span> and <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel
        Shaw</a>, <span wc_id="I931">Billy</span> and <a href=
        "BuckMyra1884.html">Myra Sieders</a> and children with Cousin <a href=
        "CongdonEmma1848.html">Em Buck</a> visited us.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. Ed (who was a very nice man) was leather buyer for the
        Endicott-Johnson Shoe Co. In the 1920s Boston had a <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather_District">Leather District</a>,
        where many leather goods factories were located. So there presumably
        were leather sellers there that Ed may have purchased from - wbt.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. I'm not sure what the difficulty was. She was only 40 at the time.
        And from the time I knew her (from 1940 to her death), she was not
        infirm. I suspect she was finding herself busy as the mother of a 7 yr.
        old - wbt.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Clarissa Madge Baxter, called "Clara" or "Claire", was born in 1883
        in Carbon Co., PA, but her father as from Nelson and Claire grew up in
        Nelson. She was a friend of my mother and the many photos I have of her
        prove that she was a beautiful young woman. When more photo albums are
        added to this website, I will try to remember to provide a link some of
        Claire's photos. Claire was a niece of <span wc_id="I686">Eva
        BAXTER</span> Foster Hazlett and a granddaughter of the Hon.
        <span wc_id="I687">Geo. Baxter</span>, whose 1st wife was <span wc_id=
        "I93">Sarah Clarissa Campbell</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.Eva is referring to Harry's mention of Clair in a <a href=
        "CCCV3p087HarryCampbell.html">previous letter</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Does anyone know which of Claire's daughters Eva was referring to?
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Almost everyone then had read Henry W. Longfellow's poem,
        <span style="font-style: italic;">The Midnight Ride of Paul
        Revere</span>. and remembered bits and pieces of, such as the lantern
        signal, "one if by land and two if by sea."&nbsp; But the next line was
        "And I on the opposite shore will be." In Longfellow's version of
        history, the lantern(s) were supposed to be hung as signals
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for</span> Paul Revere
        waiting across the Charles River in Cambridge, not signals <span style=
        "text-decoration: underline;">from</span> him. If interested, you can
        read <a href=
        "http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/paul-reveres-ride.html">a
        more accurate account of the ride</a>.

        &nbsp;Just Christmas I drove to New York with Ed on business. We did a
        little Christmas shopping and took in a show. Next to <a href=
        "http://www.ovrtur.com/production/2879949">Blossom Time</a> I think
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Miller">Marilyn
        Miller</a> in "<a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny_%28musical%29">Sunny</a>" the best
        musical I've seen. Returning we had a short time with Cousins <a href=
        "BuckGeorge1877.html">George</a> and <span wc_id="I927">Anna
        Buck</span> at Madison, New Jersey, found Cousin Em there and just
        missed Cousins <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> and
        <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Ann Owlett</a>, who were driving over
        that afternoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had a very nice visit with <span wc_id="I1276">Betty</span> and
        <span wc_id="I1277">Roy Walker</span> in North Brookfield one night on
        a trip to Utica last fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christmas we spent with <span wc_id="I1595">Treva</span> and <a href=
        "LoopStella1863.html">Mama</a>. I suppose Treva and <span wc_id=
        "I666">Jack</span> are enjoying themselves in Florida, We do hope
        Jack's health is better when he returns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Junior and I spent two weeks in Nelson in August and enjoyed the
        Campbell Reunion again. Mama is expecting us Easter so I hope the roads
        will be opened up<sup>7</sup> after the long snowy winter we've had.
      </p>
      <p>
        Johnson City had an epidemic of "Flu" in February but it is nearly over
        now. Aside from that, we've all been very well and enjoyed ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heard so many good things over the Radio during the winter that we have
        always been well entertained.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the coming summer we hope to see more of the relatives stopping
        on their way thru town.

        7. It was difficult to drive the cars of the day on dirt roads (which
        almost all were) if either: a) they were icy; or b) a quagmire from
        spring rains. Driving cars had to be kept to a minimum until the Spring
        rains ended and the mud dried --- and the deep ruts could be filled in
        and the high spots scraped down --- thus "opening the roads." .
