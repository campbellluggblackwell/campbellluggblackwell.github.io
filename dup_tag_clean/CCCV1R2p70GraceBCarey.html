        Dear Cousins:-

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        What a pleasure it is going to be to have my visit with you all while
        sitting in the car on this glorious sunshiny afternoon. I am waiting
        for <span wc_id="I1566">Mr. Carey</span> to finish his business at the
        Union Structural Steel Plant.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        We came to Syracuse this morning from Elmira, a distance of ninety-two
        miles. With our good New York State roads it makes a very enjoyable
        trip. The hill sides are still gorgeous with autumn coloring, and as we
        went over the hills and through the valleys it all seemed so wonderful
        that I felt thankful to&nbsp; be living.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that you all know that on January 6, 1920, I married my next
        door neighbor. He has one son, <span wc_id="I1567">John B. Jr.</span>,
        who lives with his <span wc_id="I13638">grandmother</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have spent a greater part of the time in Pittsburgh, Pa., and the
        past year in Buffalo where Mr. Carey is located. Just at present we
        have opened up our home at 439 West Clinton Street, Elmira, and will be
        here until after Christmas.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1545">Pearl</span> was married on August 27th, 1923 to
        Dr. <span wc_id="I1548">Frederick H. Wise</span>, of Auburn, N.Y. (a
        brother of her <span wc_id="I1546">first husband</span>). They are
        nicely settled in a new home. <span wc_id="I1549">Henry</span> thinks
        his Uncle makes a fine "daddy".<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1551">Joseph W. Buck</span> was graduated from Princeton
        in 1913,- went to law school and was admitted to the bar two years
        later. He has been very successful. On October 25, 1920 he was married
        to <span wc_id="I1552">Marjorie Eldridge</span>. They have two fine
        boys,- <span wc_id="I1553">George Wallace</span> and <span wc_id=
        "I1555">Joseph Campbell</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1559">Ruth C. Buck</span> was graduated from Wellesley
        College in 1917. The following October she was married to <span wc_id=
        "I1560">William H. Mandeville</span>, who was a Captain in the 304th
        Field Artillery at the time. While he was in France, <span wc_id=

        I want to you all to know how much I have enjoyed the Cousins letters.

      <p>
        It was an unexpected pleasure to meet Cousin <span wc_id="I948">Helen
        Congdon</span> on the train. I should certainly have enjoyed a visit
        with her at our home.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want you all to know that our home is always open to you. I am always
        glad to hear Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie
        Congdon</a>'s voice on the phone as I know then that he will run in
        between trains and we can have a little chat.
      </p>
      <p>
        With sincere good wishes for your health and happiness,
