        <span wc_id="I875">Hugh</span> is in the Adirondack Mountains deer
        hunting at the present time and not knowing whether he has written to
        the Cousins, I will try to send our message to you.

      <p>
        May 1st we bought an Oldsmobile touring car and have enjoyed every
        minute of our summer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the many pleasant trips we have taken during the summer, our trip
        to Mansfield <span class="Annotation">[PA]</span> to the Cousins Dinner
        will be remembered as one of the most enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        Our family are all very well. The two older girls, <span wc_id=
        "I879">Gertrude</span> and <span wc_id="I892">Helen</span>, are in
        school every day, while <span wc_id="I901">Thelma</span> keeps company
        at home for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I836">Father Ellison</span> has closed their house for the
        winter and has rooms at the Randolphs at Himrods <span class=
        "Annotation">[NY-wbt]</span>. Both their girls being away at school,
        they felt it wasn't worth while to keep a big house going. <span wc_id=
        "I842">Frances</span>, the oldest, is in Keuka College, this being her
        second year, while <span wc_id="I844">Pauline</span> goes to Penn Yan
        <span class="Annotation">[NY]</span> High School.
      </p>
      <p>
        Father has just finished his many years of service for the New York
        Central Railroad, having passed his seventieth birthday this month.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sister <span wc_id="I846">Edna</span> is in Rochester <span class=
        "Annotation">[NY]</span> with her two youngest children, <span wc_id=
        "I864">Billy</span> and <span wc_id="I873">Betty</span>, and has a good
        position there.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two older boys, <span wc_id="I848">Lynn</span> and <span wc_id=
        "I855">Donald</span> enlisted in the Navy, on July 26th, as
        Pharmacists, being located in Portsmouth, Va.

        Looking forward with great pleasure for the second edition of the
        Campbell Cousins Correspondence,
