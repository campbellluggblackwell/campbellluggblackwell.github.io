        [The text and illustrations below are from a brochure I picked up at
        Holy Cross (or Holy Rood) Church in <a href=
        "http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/place_page.jsp?p_id=10339">Avening</a>,
        Gloucestershire, when my wife Mary and I visited there in 2000. It's an
        incredible feeling, being in this building built on orders of Wm. the
        Conqueror's wife, <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_of_Flanders">Queen Matilda</a>.
        Just feeling all those centuries since it's Norman construction become
        palpable. And knowing that it's where <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann
        Clinch</a> Campbell was christened and where her parents, <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Clinch-347">Thomas Clinch</a> and
        <a href="LuggSarah1778.html">Sarah Lugg</a>, were married. And the
        parish where many of our Blackwells came from. But some of the oral
        histories distorted the name to "Haven Parish". Avening still has a pub
        once owned and operated by Thomas' brother-in-law, <span wc_id=

        aded some linkes to augment it.---Bill Thompson, 2012]

        Ancient tombs with port-hole windows, unearthed in 1809 in a field
        called the Norn and removed to the Glebe field near the Old Quarries
        entrance, show that Avening was inhabited 3,000 years before Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coins and broken pottery found from time to time in fields and gardens
        testify to the Roman occupation of this Parish.

        The old stone coffin [<a href=
        "https://mapio.net/images-p/24395891.jpg/">photo</a>] outside the porch
        is evidence of the extensive burial ground before the Conquest, and
        that being so, perhaps there was a Saxon Church, of which the carved
        stones in the wall near the font, said to bear Saxon designs, may be
        the sole surviving remains.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Norman times Avening was a favorite resort of royalty, for the manor
        came into the hands of William I and the story leading up the building
        of the Church is closely linked with a royal romance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book">Doomsday
        book</a> tells of a <a href=
        "http://www.themodernapprentice.com/mews.htm">hawk-mews</a> at Avening
        Court, which belonged, before the Conquest, to Brittric <span class=
        "Annotation">[a Clinch- wbt]</span>. This young man, Lord of Gloucester
        who also held an estate at <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tewkesbury">Tewksbury</a>, was sent by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_the_Confessor">Edward the
        Confessor</a> on an embassy to <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_I,_Count_of_Flanders">Baldwin,
        Count of Flanders</a>, where he met Matilda, who was later to become
        the wife of the Conqueror.
      </p>
      <p>
        Matilda fell in love with him, but to her great disappointment he
        rejected her approaches and William, Duke of Normandy, eventually won
        her hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly after their accession she revengefully caused the King to
        dispossess Brittric of the manor of Avening and other estates and throw
        him into prison in Worcester, where he died. It is said that in her
        remorse for the persecution of Brittric she entirely build Avening
        Church, that the masses might be said for his soul. While in residence
        at Avening Court the king and queen superintended the the building
        operations. At the consecration on Holy Cross Day, September 14th 1080
        (some say it was as early as 1070), the queen gave a feast to the
        builders, of boar's head, shot in the forest, and the Avening Feast is
        still celebrated on "<a href=
        "http://www.cotswolds.info/strange-things/pig-face-day-avening.shtml">Pig
        Face Day</a>".
      </p>
      <p>
        A charter records that in 1082, "William and Matilda endowed the Abbey
        of Holy Trinity, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caen">Caen</a>,
        with the manors of Avening, Nailsworth and other lands, for the good of
        their souls." They had already built and endowed two religious
        communities at Caen, and of the one, "the <a href=
        "http://www.sacred-destinations.com/france/caen-abbaye-aux-dames">Abbey
        aux Dames</a>," Matilda's daughter was the first nun and second abbess.
      </p>
      <p>
        Caen retained the Avening endowments for 333 years, during which time
        the Church was served by French priests sent here from Caen. The Church
        is dedicated to the Holy Rood, or Cross, St. Mary the Virgin being the
        patron saint.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Registers date from 1557. A list of Rectors dating from 1251 is in
        the Church. Many of them were famous; one afterwards became Bishop of
        St. David's, and another was Bishop of Gloucester. Another point of
        interest is that the present priest in charge, The <a href=
        "http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2005_13_mon_03.shtml">Reverend
        Celia Carter</a>, was one of the first group of ordained women to be
        priested in the Church of England in May 1994 in <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloucester_Cathedral">Gloucester
        Cathedral</a> and was the first non-stipendary woman priests to be in
        charge of a parish. The parishes of Avening and Cherington were united
        in one benefice in 1975.

        <span style="font-style: italic;">These notes, written by Canon Cooper,
        a former rector, who loved this church dearly, were reviewed by his
        successors, Cannon Richards and Rev'd. R. E. Gleed. Exhibits from the
        Museum are now displayed in the Museum in Cirencester.</span>

      <p>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">TAKE THIS GUIDE ROUND WITH
        YOU</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">H</span>ere is one of the most
        interesting and best preserved ancient churches in the <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotswolds">Cotswolds</a>. It has great
        attraction for archaeologists and much admired by visitors from all
        parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dedicated to the Holy Rood, or Cross, in 1080, it has had additions and
        alterations made in the following centuries in successive architectural
        styles as can be seen from the plan and models in the church.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Main Doorway</span> as you enter
        by the main porch notice the handsome Norman doorway with
        characteristic dog-tooth moulding similar to the contemporary arches in
        Gloucester Cathedral. This arch is supported by two twisted pillars of
        unusual Norman design, but similar to those in Durham Cathedral. A
        handsome perpendicular doorway has been skillfully blended with this
        Norman work. To this early English porch a parvise, or upper priest's
        chamber was added in the 15th century. It was approached by an outside
        stairway, now removed, and another doorway (now blocked) probably led
        to the Rood loft. The floor was recently removed to expose the Norman
        arch.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Nave</span> As you enter you stand
        in the original Norman Church consisting of <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nave">nave</a>, tower, and half of the
        present <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancel">chancel</a>. On
        the north side is a small Norman aisle, the roof of which once gave
        access from an outside staircase to the Rood loft, and later to a
        gallery running along the north and west of the nave but removed in
        1902. The figures were removed at the Reformation, and the loft in
        1829.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Altars</span> On the east wall of the
        nave are to be seen two small chevron arches. One, on the left, is
        incomplete. But here once stood two parish altars. On the right an oak
        Commonwealth table, formerly used in the chancel, bears the date 1657.
        The handsome gift cross is a memorial to a pious parishioner, a
        gilt-framed account of whom stands in the piscina.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tower</span> The massive tower is an
        example of pure Norman work except for the top storey, which was added
        late in the 14th century. The two high splayed windows are interesting
        and were once, of course, outer windows. There is a similarmone blocked
        up in the north of the choir. There are six bells in the tower. In the
        north-west pier of the tower a doorway is seen which gave access to an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorite">Anchorite</a> cell of
        which little is known.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Transepts</span> The north and south
        walls to the tower were pierced when the two Early English <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transept">transepts</a> were added to the
        Church. That in the north is known at the Bridges' aisle, after Henry
        Bridges, whose effigy is seen on his monument. He was an interesting
        character, having been a pirate, smuggler and highwayman, but on being
        pardoned by James I, he settled down in Avening. The south transept, or
        Driver's aisle, so called from the eloborate monuments, is now used as
        an organ chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chapel</span> In the outside angle,
        between the north side and the choir, there once stood a <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_chapel">Lady Chapel</a>. The door
        opening into it from the choir is now blocked up. The eastern
        foundations and the <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piscina">piscina</a> are still to be seen
        outside. Pieces of molten metal from the site are probably evidence of
        its destruction by fire. It is thought that the extension of the
        chancel was made to replace this chapel.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chance</span>l The chief features to
        be admired there is the fine <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groin_vault">groined</a> stone roof, the
        vaulting ribs of which, in the eastern portion, were skilfully made to
        harmonise with the earlier vault when the Norman part of the choir was
        extended eastward. The ribs carry two fine carved <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_%28architecture%29">bosses</a>.
        Several past Rectors lie buried beneath the floor and numerous vaults
        exist under the Church. The pulpit, which originally stood in Shewsbury
        Abbey, was given by Mr. Polllack.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows</span> The original windows
        have everywhere been replaced by later stonework between the 13th and
        16th centuries. All the glass is modern and the somewhat uncommon
        subjects and treatment deserve attention [<span style=

        photo2</a>].</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fonts</span> The present <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptismal_font">font</a> is modern and
        replaced an earlier one now in the museum but, built into the wall by
        the main door, are two fragments considered to be part of the original
        Norman font. The six figures may represent the Apostles, as these are
        commonly used for decoration at the time. The smaller fragment was
        thought by Fosbury to be Adam and Eve, often associated with the
        original sin and baptism.
