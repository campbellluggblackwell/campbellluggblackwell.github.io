      <big>Mary CAMPBELL Hazlett (1779 - 1824)<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>Mary was born Mar. 19, 1779, in Scotland or N. Ireland; d. Apr. 10,
      1824, in Lancaster Co., PA. She married in Lancaster Co. or N. Ireland to
      a <span wc_id="I12">John Hazlett</span> who was born in County Down, N.
      Ireland. We have no evidence that he was related to the <a href=
      "HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John Hazlett</a> that married Mary's sister,
      <a href="CampbellJane1792.html">Jane Campbell</a>, or to the <a href=
      "HazlettSamuel1780.html">Samuel Hazlett</a> that married Mary's sister
      <a href="CampbellSarah1777.html">Sarah</a> (called "Sally").<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>Mary was the 2nd of 8 children of</big> <big><a href=
      "CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph Campbell</a>, b. 1748, in Scotland, d.
      1824 in Nelson, PA, (originally called <a href=
      "BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's Island</a>); and <a href=
      "HarperMary1749.html">Mary Harper</a>, b. 1749, in Scotland, d. 1844 in
      Nelson.<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>Mary's older sister Sally, and brother, <a href=
      "CampbellJohn1781.html">John</a>, came to America before their younger
      siblings. We're not sure exactly when. Sometime between 1800 and 1802
      seems likely for Sam and Sally --- their first child, <span wc_id=
      "I38">Archibald Hazlett</span> was born in Lancaster Co., PA in 1803.
      John, Mary, and <a href="CampbellElizabeth1789.html">Elizabeth</a> may
      have come slightly later. Brother John Campbell married soon after his
      arrival and shortly thereafter moved to what is now Pittsburgh. Mary's
      son Robert, was born in PA in 1809, so we know she was here before
      then.<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>Mary's parents, and youngest siblings sailed from Londonderry to
      Perth Amboy, NJ in 1810 and went to Sam Hazlett's farm near Stroudsburg
      PA before going to Nelson.<br></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>John Campbell and wife <span wc_id="I13">Elizabeth Bell</span> moved
      to a farm near Pittsburgh shortly after they married,</big> <big>before
      his parents came to America. He and Elizabeth never came to Nelson.
      John's oldest sister Sarah/Sally, came to America about 1800. John and
      his older sister, Mary, may not have come until 1806.</big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big>After Mary's death in 1824, her husband and children moved to a farm
      near his brother-in-law, John Campbell, in what is now Pittsburgh's North
      side. Mary Campbell and John Hazlett had ten children, all born in
      Lancaster Co., PA:<br></big>
