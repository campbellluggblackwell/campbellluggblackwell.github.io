        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Greetings to everyone! It is with pleasure that I again make my little
        contribution to the Cousins Book. It is not much, and I am always at a
        loss to know what to say. However, here we are!
      </p>
      <p>
        There have been some changes since the last exchange of letters,
        thought I think most of us are about as usual. I, myself, have been
        having a vacation--have not been working since February seventh.
        February eighteenth, the day after my birthday, I underwent an
        operation for goitre at the Arnot-Ogden Hospital in Elmira. Dr.
        <span wc_id="I1577">Ross Loop</span>, whom most of you know well, did
        the job. I am getting along just splendidly, and hope to be able to go
        back to work soon. You all know, I think, of <span wc_id=
        "I1102">Father</span>'s death. The rest of the family are all well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today the wind is blowing quite a gale and occasionally there are a few
        snowflakes. I have my garden plowed and hope to get some seeds in soon.
        A few of the neighbors have already beaten me to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wishing you all a pleasant and prosperous year, I am,
      </p>
