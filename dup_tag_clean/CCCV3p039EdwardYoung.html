        Dear Campbell Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        This seems to be a most appropriate day for me to be attending to my
        correspondence. My letters are always a surprise, although not always a
        delightful one.
      </p>
      <p>
        A couple of weeks ago I received a letter from my brother <span wc_id=
        "I1505">Roswell</span> addressing me as "Dear Campbell Cousin".
        Evidently with the true Bostonian aloofness he reuses to make the
        horrible admission that I am his brother. But I know why it is. He's
        jealous that I have some hair on the top of my head. If we stand
        alongside each other with our heads uncovered in a public place he's
        simply embarrassed to tears. Don't worry, though, about his losing his
        hair. He lost it long before he was married - in fact way back in the
        days when he was a freshman at college. It must have been due to
        over-study (?) .
      </p>
      <p>
        However, he asked me to write a letter to my cousins and not a
        dissertation on hair. When one writes to one's cousins, what should one
        write? What one has been doing? That's just a bit risky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last week a baritone from New York and I gave a concert in Hornell, New
        York. Several of my relatives were there including my <a href=
        "YoungPhilip1866.html">father</a>, <span wc_id="I1501">sister</span>
        and <span wc_id="I1502">brother-in-law</span>; also - a friend of mine
        came on from Buffalo to attend the concert. Now, you wouldn't jump at a
        conclusion like that - I didn't say it was a young lady friend! The
        following morning we all rode back to Elmira in my father's new car.
        Say, by the way, I suppose you all know that I have a new <span wc_id=
        "I1533">sister-in-law</span>. You just bet your life I have. I flatter
        myself that I helped to complete the job by pushing down the keys on
        the organ while my brother <span wc_id="I1532">Clifford</span>'s knees
        behaved in a most mysterious manner. I am the only one now in the Young
        family that isn't signed up for life.

        Perhaps you will be interested to know that I am still doing my bit
        toward making New York a noisier place by pursuing the musical
        profession. Yesterday I started organ lessons with <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Tertius_Noble">Tertius
        Noble</a><sup>1</sup>, the organist at St. Thomas' Fifth Avenue Church.
        He is considered on of the greatest organists in the country, but he
        will not have that marvellous <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>
        disposition when he gets through with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having complied with Roswell's request, I shall now look forward to
        hearing all about my Campbell Cousins who are scattered all over the
        country. No one state seems to have been big enough to keep more than a
        few of them.

        1. Small World Trivia: The link for Tertius Nobel tells us that for he
        was organist and choirmaster in Ely Cathedral in England One of Ann
        Clinch's English relatives, whom I met several times and corresponded
        with (one of these days I hope to add his letters to our web site), the
        <span wc_id="I154">Rev Cannon Edward Claude Essex</span>, was a cannon
        at Ely Cathedral.
