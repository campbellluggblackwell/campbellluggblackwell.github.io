      <p>
        Dear Cousins and All:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        <span class="UL">Greetings from the Sunshine City</span>. Yes, it is
        truly the Sunshine City of the world, where birds are singing, flowers
        are blooming and fruit is on the trees the whole year. One has to see
        to believe and I wish you might all spend one winter, as I have,- in
        St. Petersburg.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I came to Florida, I thought I would do lots of writing to the
        Cousins and friends, but I have failed; and I feel more grateful
        <span class="UL">than ever</span> to Cousin <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> who conceived the idea of a
        "Campbell Cousins Correspondence" where one can write an individual
        letter to at least forty at one time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a>, <span wc_id=
        "I1691">Frank</span> and I left Mansfield <span class=
        "Annotation">[PA]</span> January 21st. We spent two days in Washington,
        D. C., with Cousin <a href="CraneJennie1852.html">Jennie Bosard</a> and
        family<sup>1</sup>. Cousin Jennie and <span wc_id="I1050">Mary</span>
        were with us both days of sight-seeing which we much enjoyed. We also
        had another good friend, a nephew of Brother <span wc_id="I787">Lish
        Horton</span>,-- Capt. H. M. Horton, who added much to our pleasure
        while there. He and his new bride called and gave us the use of their
        fine seven passenger car and chauffeur as long as we were in the city;
        -- they spent part of the time with us, visiting the Capitol, White
        House, Army and Navy Building, Congressional Library, etc. The next day
        we drove to Arlington Heights and Mount Vernon, where are the home and
        tomb of our President and wife, George and Martha Washington. It is a
        beautiful place and our people, in all these years, do not forget the
        love and respect due the Father of our Country. The caskets are never
        without fresh flowers, and one might think to look at them (the
        caskets) that they were placed there only yesterday instead of many,
        many years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        We left Washington<sup>2</sup> in the sleet and rain and in two days
        reached the city of Continual Sunshine. I have not room enough to tell
        of its beauties. The streets are mostly one hundred feet wide, -- some
        of them ought to be much wider for they are so full of cars it is
        almost impossible to get through, and as you all know, there is nothing
        slow about Tommie, -- I often wonder where or how we will ever come
        out.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. Jennie and 2 of her daughters -- Florence and Mary plus Mary's
        husband and step-son.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Presumably by train. Cars and roads were still fairly primitive,
        so.travel from the North East to Florida was usually by train or boat.

        Tommie is certainly a busy man; is at his office early and late looking
        after his real estate; -- but his is never too tired to remember the
        pleasures of others, both he and Frank have given me the time of my
        life; they have left nothing undone which could add to my pleasure and
        it has been a wonderful winter -- for me.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        They both keep young and say it is due to the "Fountain of Youth," the
        water of which is their daily beverage; <span class="UL">I</span> still
        find the same grey hairs and occasionally wear my glasses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Church attendance here is remarkable; all Churches seat from twelve
        hundred to twenty-five hundred and every seat is taken an hour before
        services. There were twelve hundred at the regular prayer meeting last
        Wednesday night, one hundred and forty-seven being from Pennsylvania.
        They have some wonderful speakers from all parts of the United States,
        such as Carrie Chapman Catt, Mrs. Newberry, Mrs. Hay, Mrs. Wm. J.
        Bryan, etc.; the one last Sunday was Dr. G. Campbell Morgan from
        London, England.
      </p><br>
      They also have beautiful Parks and water-front on Tampa Bay and the Gulf,
      where the water is warm enough for swimming the year round. One hundred
      thousand tourists visited the City this winter; they also have an
      abundance of tropical fruit and nuts. We drove out to a large orchard of
      several thousand trees. The ground was yellow with grapefruit and
      oranges. I picked a bushel basket full of the grapefruit from one tree in
      less than five minutes. Think of a bushel of delicious grapefruit for
      twenty cents, the price we paid for it.<br>
      <p>
        After all these wonderful privileges which I have enjoyed, I often find
        myself thinking of the dear old <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowanesque_River">Cowanesque Valley</a>
        with our sturdy Scotch and English ancestors of which we are all so
        proud, and where we have all passed so many happy days together as one
        large family. Nothing gave me more pleasure than spending the night
        with Cousin <a href="CongdonEmma1848.html">Emma Buck</a>, <span class=
        "UL">unless</span> <span class="UL">it</span> <span class=
        "UL">was</span> when she and I made our <span class="UL">annual</span>

        Our little church which was never crowded as I have seen them here is
        dear to us all and still stands<sup>3</sup> as a memorial to its

          And also rang for pain
        </div>

          Its message rang across the town

          Like cooling summer rain.

          In its clear voice there was no doubt,

          Its song brushed care aside.
        </div>

          It whispered to the listening ones

        I hear from the children at home often, as they are well and I believe
        are to have a letter for the Cousins so I will not make mine longer.

      <p>
        Shall anxiously wait for the feast of good things which is store for us
        when we receive our second volume of the "Campbell Cousins
        Correspondence."

      3. Unfortunately, after the Methodist Church was relocated from the South
      Side of Nelson&nbsp; to the new center of the town as part of the
      Cowanesque Lake project, because so many homes had been demolished, there
      was no longer a large enough population to support two churches. The
      Methodist's building became the non-denominational community church that
      still is in use. BTW, it has a stained glass window in memoriam to to my
      ggf, the Rev. Henry D. Goodrich.&nbsp; But the Presbyterian Church
      building, erected by our Hazlett and Campbell ancestors with so much
      work, was allowed to fall into disrepair and was eventually
      demolished.<br>
