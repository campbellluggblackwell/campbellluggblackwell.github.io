      VOLUME NO. I COMPLETE
    </h4>

      <p>
        When you receive this Report, it will complete Volume No. I of our
        Campbell Cousins Correspondence, representing our two exchanges of
        letters for the year 1923. Volume No. 2 will be about the same size of
        binder and will contain the two exchanges of letters for the year
        1924.<sup>1</sup>

      LETTERS
    </h4>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I want to congratulate and complement every one of the Cousins for the
        fine letters they have written. Each one seems to have done their very
        best and what a pleasure we shall have during the coming winter season
        in reading and re-reading these letters. I want to add also that the
        second Cousins<sup>2</sup> have certainly contributed their full share
        to this Correspondence Club, and as time goes on I am sure that their
        letters will far outshine those of the first Cousins<sup>3</sup>, thus
        guaranteeing the success of our plan. I see no reason why the Club
        cannot be increased from time to time, especially where there are now
        third, fourth, and fifth Cousins in the same home. This need not
        necessitate an extra folio as both mother, child, and grandchild could
        use the same book. For example, <span wc_id="I1244">Mary Hughey</span>
        has written a lovely letter but will share her <a href=
        "BixbyHannah1863.html">mother</a>'s book; my own daughter, <span wc_id=
        "I1605">Doris</span>, has also contributed a letter and will share in
        our book. Therefore, if this plan can be worked out in any of the
        Cousin's <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> families, I hope you
        will report the fact to me before our next Report so that I may plan
        accordingly. For example, we would very like much if letters could be
        contributed by <a href="SeelyLena1873.html">Lena Goodrich</a>,
        <span wc_id="I780">Helen Wilson</span>, <span wc_id="I828">Arthur
        Horton</span>, <span wc_id="I1055">Florence Bosard</span>, <span wc_id=
        "I916">William C. Campbell, Jr.</span>,-- and a number of others whose
        names might be mentioned. Will you not give careful thought to this
        matter and co-operate as much as possible?

        1. Volume 1 was in a ring binder and contained two rounds of letters.
        Vol. 2 - 4&nbsp; only contained one exchange of letters because many of
        the Cousins only wanted to write one per year. Vol. 2 was in a spring
        binder. Vols. 3 & 4 were hard bound.

      <p>
        The photographs are simply fine and still afford a rare treat to you
        all. I should have been a little more specific in my suggestions
        regarding photographs. What I really wanted was to have photographs
        which would include the entire family, as in this way all the
        references could be made back and forth from one letter to another, and
        all of our pictures would have appeared. I want to call special
        attention to the fine groups of pictures as follows, all of which were
        taken at close range and show up very nicely indeed:

        feature of photographs in our April Report, may I suggest that in each
        case where a full group picture has not been furnished that you see to
        it that one is taken during the winter and that fifty prints are sent
        along so that they may be included in our next Report. We want to have

      REPORT FOR APRIL 15, 1924
    </h4>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        In addition to the missing pictures which are to come in for the April
        Report, I want to make a special feature of the genealogy of the first
        Cousins or third generation. Our Report No. 1 contained a few pages
        giving the genealogy of the first and second generations complete, and
        we must now put down in order the record of the next generation. In the
        early part of January, I shall mail to each of the first Cousins or
        their representatives a carefully prepared chart which should be filled
        out with great care and returned to me for compilation purposes. There
        were but thirty of the first Cousins as you will note by referring to
        page 3 of Report No. 1. The information to be placed on the chart will
        be something as follows: Full name,- date of birth,- place of birth,-
        if married, then date of marriage,- and name of and exact date of birth
        of person married,- together with place of birth, in case of death of a
        first Cousin give exact date and place of death;- in case of more than
        one marriage, then exact data to cover this point. In some cases it may
        be necessary to refer very carefully to family Bibles, etc., but this
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span> <span style=
        "text-decoration: underline;">be</span> <span style=
        "text-decoration: underline;">done</span> in a very strict manner if
        our Report is to be complete and authentic. When these charts have been
        returned to me, I shall then be able to work up for you all some
        careful statistics which will completely cover

      REPORT BY STATES
    </h4>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I thought it would be interesting to show this page (Page "<a href=
        "CCCV1R2pAA.html">AA</a>") so that you might observe how widely
        scattered our relatives really are. The state of Pennsylvania (good old
        State) stands there with eighteen reports or 100% perfect. This
        certainly is fine inasmuch as she is contributing more than one third
        of the letters for this report.

      RETURN POST CARD

      <p>
        In order to insure prompt delivery, this Report is sent to you by first
        class mail and should be received by you without delay. Considerable
        delay was experienced in the delivery of the June Reports as they were
        sent by Parcel Post and Insured. In order that I may know that you have
        received your Report, will you please be good enough to date, sign and
        return to me the post card which you will find at the top of this
        Report?

      DELINQUENTS
    </h4>
    <div class="Message">
      Your Secretary was extremely anxious that this Photographic Number should
      be 100% complete both as to letters and photographs. With this end in
      view, I have been very persistent in writing a few of the Cousins who
      must have overlooked our numerous requests and have purposely helt the
      report open an extra week in order that none should be left out whose
      letters and photographs could possibly be included. We were especially
      anxious to include letters and photos of Cousins <span wc_id=
      "I1477">Carrie Campbell</span>, <span wc_id="I1222">Ed Hughey</span>,
      <span wc_id="I947">Lee Congdon</span> and <span wc_id="I1478">Harry
      Campbell</span>, who we understand is still over in France.<sup>4</sup>
      How nice it would have been if these missing letters and photos could
      have been included! These particular members of our Club will have to do
      as <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie Congdon</a> did by writing a
      nice newsy letter for our Report next April. However, a total of
      forty-eight reports from a club of fifty-two is a mighty good showing and
      again I feel like congratulating the entire Clan on its hearty
      co-operation.

        Within another week or two, I shall figure out what it has cost to get
        out Volume Number One complete and will send you a memorandum covering
        your share. A little fund has already been created to care of a few of
        our Cousins who might feel that the yearly cost of these Reports was
        somewhat of a burden. If, therefore, you receive no bill from the
        Secretary, you will understand that your share of the expense has
        already been taken care of.
