        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        It would seem that such a delightful spring day should inspire my
        unskilled pen to a letter worthy of a place in the Campbell Cousins
        Correspondence.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some time ago I received a letter from <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a> inviting me to contribute a
        letter but I little thought that I should be the sole representative of
        our family but such seems to be the case, unless my sister <span wc_id=
        "I1276">Elizabeth</span> is able to write.
      </p>
      <p>
        My <a href="GoodrichFrances1871.html">mother</a>, who is of course the
        most important member of the family, seems to have been much in demand
        this winter.
      </p>
      <p>
        On March 5th, <span wc_id="I1276">Betty</span> presented a sturdy son
        to the Hoyt family and also of course to the Campbell Clan. Needless to
        say, his "Gram" Hoyt had to be there to see that <span wc_id=
        "I1282">David Roy</span> was properly welcomed into this world. She had
        been back with me only a few weeks when <span wc_id="I1250">Jess</span>
        sent for her to come to Binghamton<sup>1</sup>. The children all have
        had measles and to make matters worse they were just beginning to get
        better when Tom and Henry each had an abscess in the ear. Of course
        this makes it impossible for either Mother or Jess to write, as caring
        for three sick children is about all they can manage.
      </p>
      <p>
        My Easter vacation<sup>2</sup> begins Good Friday and continues through
        Easter Week. I am planning to spend it at Atlantic City, Philadelphia
        and Harrisburg. I am sure those Cousins who are or have been in the
        teaching profession appreciate my delight at getting away from the
        school room for a few days and then to come back and take up the work
        with renewed enthusiasm.

        While over town to lunch this noon, I met Cousin <span wc_id=
        "I780">Helen Wilson</span> she apparently was on that delight of a
        woman's heart, -- a shopping tour.<br>

        I have not been in Nelson for some time but at this time of year I
        always feel a particular urge to go up to "The Farm"<sup>3</sup> which
        some of you people still think of as <a href=
        "CampbellPhebe1832.html">Aunt Phoebe</a>'s, and then hike up to "The
        Rocks"<sup>4</sup> which was the scene of many good times when we were
        youngsters.<br>
