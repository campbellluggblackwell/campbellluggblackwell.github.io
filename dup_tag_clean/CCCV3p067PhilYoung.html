        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        All I can say about the past year is that it has been quite similar to
        other years. It was a good business year and the family has been well
        generally with the exception of <span wc_id="I1497">Ida</span>'s
        <span wc_id="I1498">father</span> who died in February.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ida and I had our usual trip to Miami in February, going down by boat
        and returning by rail. We landed in Washington on Inauguration Day and
        witnessed the inaugural ceremonies<sup>1</sup> which were quite
        wonderful. Miami has become so crowded that it is about as impossible
        to cross the street as at Forty-second Street in New York
        City<sup>2</sup>, and prices of real estate have gone nearly to the
        sky<sup>3</sup>. I understand, however, it is not any different from
        most of the State of Florida. For climate you cannot beat Miama
        <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> --seventy-six degrees nearly
        every day from February first<sup>4</sup>. We were there three weeks
        and enjoyed delightful swimming every day that we desired.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had a short but pleasant visit from <a href=
        "CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie Campbell</a> and his family, the
        Shewmans<sup>5</sup>, last summer, and just a look at <a href=
        "CampbellWilliam1864.html">Will Campbell</a> and his <span wc_id=
        "I905">wife</span> from Marinette, Wisconsin. It seemed awfully good to
        get a look at Will and Louise some more, and we always enjoy Tommie and
        his whole family, only they do not come often enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have a new six cylinder <a href=

        Willys-Knight</a> sedan which is the best ever. I will leave the rest
        of the family to speak for themselves. Hoping that the whole of the
        Campbell Clan is happy and well, I remain,

        2. NYC only started installing traffic signals in the 1920s. In 1925,
        they were on towers, had only 2 colors -- red and green, and were
        manually operated by a traffic policeman. It may be that not all of the
        intersections on 42nd Street had signals or cops yet. The role of
        yellow was handled by having both red and green on at the same time -
        plus the traffic cop blew his whistle to worn people that the light was
        about to change. 3 color lights, pedestrian signals, and automatically
        timed lights were not installed til the 1950s.

        months.
