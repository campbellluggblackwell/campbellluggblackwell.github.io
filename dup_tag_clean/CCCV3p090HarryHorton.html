        Dear Cousins:

      <p>
        How is it possible to write a bright, snappy and happy letter the first
        week of the fishing season when the snow is a foot deep and the streams
        swollen out of their banks? In fact, we have our rod all newly
        varnished, our favorite flies all tied, and <span wc_id=
        "I827">John</span> has even furnished me with a can of nice fat worms
        for this first trip, and then along comes our annual April snowstorm to
        help take the joy our of life! Of course, we should be happy, for it
        means more irrigation water for the farmer and indirectly a living for
        the poor dentist. We have put off our real fishing until July Fourth
        when, as <span wc_id="I773">Llewellyn</span> and <a href=
        "ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel</a> can tell you, the thermometer stands
        one hundred ten degrees in the shade and the streams are so low you
        don't need fishhooks to bring home a full basket.
      </p>

        The past year has been rather uneventful with us excepting the
        wonderful visit we had with the Shaws. I believe they were rather glad
        to reach Baker after traveling over the hot sands of the desert in
        midsummer, but their pleasure couldn't compare with ours, for when one
        sees their near and dear kinfolks only once in twenty years, only those
        far from home can realize the happiness. We talked of you all, even to
        the cousins of the nth degree, and I must say the clan has surely
        increased since I was a boy in the <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowanesque_River">Cowanesque Valley</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have all been fairly well this past year, and with the exception of
        the regular run of grippe and colds have managed to weather a long and
        cold winter. <span wc_id="I825">Jean</span>, the oldest one of the
        trio, has been away at school, and we have surely missed her. She is
        attending St. Margaret's Hall (Episcopalian) at Boise, Idaho, and
        enjoys it very much. We drive over(one hundred forty miles) quite often
        for the week-end, and she is home for her vacations, but I am beginning
        to realize what it means when they begin to leave us, and can only
        think how lonesome the old home at Westfield must have been for
        <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Mother</a> as we four left one by one
        for new fields of endeavor.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I823">Helen</span>'s father, <span wc_id="I824">Sam
        Hamilton</span> of Duluth, Minnesota, has spent the past winter here,
        and we have surely enjoyed having him with us. He is eighty-two years
        old, but as spry and active as I hope to be at that age. He has been a
        timber cruiser all his life and enjoys the outdoors and fishing. We are
        planning many fine trips for the summer.

        We have seen neither <span wc_id="I790">Frank</span> nor <span wc_id=
        "I815">Nellie</span> nor <span wc_id="I828">Arthur</span> for over a
        year. It really seems too bad when we live in the same state, and with
        a little effort could be together at least once during the summer for a
        little visit. Oregon is a mighty big state, and to travel four hundred
        miles over our mountains takes time and money. Our highways are
        wonderful, with macadam roads from the eastern border to the western
        and southern, and a continuous stream of tourists are making good use
        of them even at this early date.

        This last year's Cousins Book has been a great delight to us. I have
        spent many happy evenings reading and dreaming over its pages. The
        ancestral chart<sup>1</sup> is something which we shall prize more
        highly with each succeeding year and will become more valuable with
        each coming generation. I feel we owe a great debt of gratitude to
        those cousins who have worked so faithfully in its compilation.
