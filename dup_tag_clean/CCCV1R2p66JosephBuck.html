          Dear <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a>:-
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Message">
        <p>
          I acknowledge the receipt of your recent letters requesting news from
          our branch of the family, together with photographs. I am afraid that
          I do not have any photographs which would be appropriate for your
          use.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the idea of the "Campbell Cousins Correspondence" is very
          good and think that we will all benefit by getting acquainted with
          our relations. Personally, I think it would be a fine thing if this
          exchange of letters would give us more of the early history of out
          family. Surely a great many remember some of the tales which have
          been handed down concerning the trials and tribulations of our
          pioneer ancestors. I, myself, have always been very anxious to know
          more about exactly where the Campbells first came from. We know, in a
          general way, that our <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Great
          Grandfather</a> lived in Scotland, then moved over into Ireland and
          then came to this country. Cannot some of us tell exactly what town
          he came from in Scotland?
        </p>
        <p>
          I was married to <span wc_id="I1552">Marjorie B. Eldredge</span> of
          this City on October 25, 1920 and now have two boys, <span wc_id=
          "I1553">George Wallace Buck</span>, born January 5, 1922 and
          <span wc_id="I1555">Joseph Campbell Buck</span>, born June 27, 1923.
          I am a lawyer and manage to keep very busy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will always be glad to see any of the Cousins whenever they are in
          Elmira.<br>
