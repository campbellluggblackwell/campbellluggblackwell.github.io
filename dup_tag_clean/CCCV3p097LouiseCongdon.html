        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Again, greetings from California!
      </p>
      <p>
        There's really nothing much of interest to write about -- no radical
        change having taken place in our doings and surroundings since the last
        letter, except a few trips between California and Pennsylvania by
        various members of the family, both points having their charms for the
        Congdons.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I962">Bernice</span> and I are planning to drive back to
        Marshalls Falls<sup>1</sup> this spring and spend the summer there with
        <span wc_id="I961">Mother</span>. <a href=
        "CongdonCharles1856.html">Father</a> will no doubt join us if he can
        tear himself away from California. It seems to have "got" him at least
        he has been on the Coast since December.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bernice joins me in sending best wishes to all the cousins.

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. Charley Congdon's summer home was in Marshalls Fall, PA (South of
        Stroudsburg). He also owned a resort hotel on adjacent property.
        Because his school music and textbook publishing business was in NYC,
        he primarily lived in a NYC hotel. Louise became ill and spent several
        years in CA and AZ for her health, accompanied by her sister and
        mother. At the time of this letter, Louise seems to have recovered
        enough to travel and for her mother to leave her for months.
