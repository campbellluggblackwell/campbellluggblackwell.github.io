        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I have four days left to get this letter to "Headquarters." I think
        I'll manage to get it there on time if none of you bother me. I would
        not care though if some of you did step in on me and bother me, I'd
        sure be glad to see some of my <a href=
        "HugheyHerbert1857.html">father</a>'s Cousins, not just <span style=
        "text-decoration: underline;">some</span> of you, but <span style=
        "text-decoration: underline;">all</span> of you.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I received a "reminder" from Cousin <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> yesterday, telling me to hurry
        up with my letter. I've been thinking about writing this letter for a
        long time but do you know, I think it's rather a hard job to write to
        sixty or seventy people all at once. I'd rather write just one letter
        at a time. I wrote to my sister <span wc_id="I1244">Mary</span>
        yesterday, and to my Aunt Helen, (mother's youngest sister) out in
        Shelton, Washington, and it was not any job at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think my brother <span wc_id="I1222">Edd</span> must be at Shelton or
        Tacoma now. They left Montana<sup>1</sup> on the first of April. I hope
        he will write a big long letter and tell us what he thinks of the
        Coast. He will be able to go and see <span wc_id="I947">Cousin
        Le</span>e and <span wc_id="I941">Georgia</span><sup>2</sup> and
        <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Cousin Edd</a> and all the rest of the
        folks that live on the Coast. I wish I could step into his shoes for a
        little while. Maybe they would not fit me, but I would manage to keep
        them on.
      </p>

        We are very busy folks here in Deerwood now. "Spring" is a month
        earlier this year than last. We have been hurrying to get things done
        up so we can get our crops in early. We have not had much rain yet, and
        we did not have very much snow during the winter, so we may have
        another dry summer and that means hoe and cultivate to kill the weeds
        and hold the moisture. We are planning to set out a big patch of
        raspberries. We can manage them all right by cultivation. We tried
        ever-gearing strawberries for two years, but they need irrigation to
        make them bear, and we are not fixed to do any irrigating.

        I have some Parcel Post baby chicks coming next Tuesday, the 15th. I
        sent to Zeeland, Michigan for some Tom Barron English strain White
        Leghorns. This winter, I have had sixty-five White Leghorn pullets to
        work with.

        1. Edd and his family sold their ranch because of his eyesight. They
        moved to WA because relatives they'd known back in Brainerd, MN had
        previously moved to Tacoma & its environs.

      I raised them last summer. Last month those sixty-five pullets laid 1340
      eggs. This month they are doing still better. I'm getting an average of
      sixty eggs per day<sup>3</sup>.

        We have in our community here a "Farmers Club", or as we call it, a
        "Community Club". We have two Townships in our club. There is supposed
        to be a Farmers Club in every Township in the country. We have a County
        Agent who would be hard to beat. He works with all his might for the
        farmers, and we have a man in our Deerwood Bank who is almost as good
        as the County Agent. He is what you would call a good "mixer." He steps
        right out and attends all our meetings. He lectures for us on different
        topics of interest to the farmers and he is also an auctioneer. Very
        seldom he charges for anything he does, for the farmers. He says he
        wants to help put them on their feet. And I guess you will all agree
        with me that the farmers need all the help they can get. What I am
        aiming to tell you is this -- we are organizing a Poultry and Egg
        Association and expect soon to commence shipping our eggs out to you
        folks in "New York." So if you get a carton of nice fresh eggs that has
        printed matter upon it telling you it is from the Deerwood-Aitkin
        Poultry Association, you will know that "I" helped to produce these
        eggs.

        This summer all you Cousins can think of me as I am hoeing weeds,
        picking berries, feeding chickens, and peddling my produce in my
        "Little Old Ford." I also sell milk and cream. I say "I" because it is
        "I" who does the peddling. My "better half" objects to doing any
        peddling. I find that men are seldom any good at peddling anyway.
      </p>

        I suppose I am in for a scolding now when it comes to not having some
        pictures ready to send along with this letter. But I'll tell you what
        to do, -- just leave a little corner someplace in your book and I'll
        send them later on. You won't be out much because I am the homeliest
        black sheep in the family. I'm something like <a href=
        "BuckGeorge1877.html">George Buck</a>'s wife, -- I've had to eat bread
        crusts and scraps all my life and I weigh almost one hundred and eighty
        pounds (180) as the result<sup>4</sup>.

        I hope we will get lots of nice long letters this time. We will have a
        whole year to read them in. And I was thinking that maybe if some of

        3. As some of you know, back then, and for many decades before, farm
        wives coud sell their eggs to the general store and keep the proceeds
        as ther peersonal spending money.

        4. Carrie is referring to George Buck's last letter, in which he wrote:
        "Well my family is large. You think I mean large in number but what I
        really mean is that Anna, my wife, weighs one hundred and seventy‑five
        pounds (although she is trying to reduce by eating only what the
        children and sometimes the dog won't eat in addition to her usual three
        meals a day)."

        And if any of you happen along in the vicinity of Brainerd,remember our
        house number and call in and we will try and size each other up and get
        acquainted. <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">C. H. Congdon</a> has
        been due to make us a visit for a long time. He used to come often, but
        his visits are now few and far between.

        Seems as though I cannot end this letter without bringing "<a href=

        next month to plant a flower on his grave, I'll plant a few tears for
        you all you Cousins and think of you all in his behalf.

        With kindest regards to all the Cousins, I am.
