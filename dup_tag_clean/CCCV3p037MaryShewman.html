        My dear Aunts, Uncles and Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        The time has slipped by so quickly I can not believe my letter is
        behind the schedule. I suppose "busy" is a poor excuse. However, with
        over fifty people in the house, and all wanting some little attention,
        and in serving breakfast to about one hundred twenty-five people, we
        manage to keep busy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We serve no noon luncheon except to the family which consists of
        <span wc_id="I1681">Ford Pratt</span> and <span wc_id=
        "I1682">wife</span> and <span wc_id="I1690">son</span> besides
        ourselves. At five thirty P.M. we begin serving dinner which lasts
        until seven o'clock.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ford came here early in February with his family, and expects to make
        St. Petersburg his permanent home. He, with <span wc_id=
        "I1693">Curt</span> and <span wc_id="I1704">Merritt Mitchell</span>,
        <span wc_id="I1704">Ruth</span>'s husband, has just built and started
        an open air motion picture theater for the colored people<sup>1</sup>.
        Ford has bought a piece of land on which he expects to build a number
        of small houses for sale and rent. These houses find a very ready
        market.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ford's daughter, <span wc_id="I1685">Martha</span>, recently of Elmira
        College, has entered Stetson University at Deland. Out son,
        <span wc_id="I1688">Tom</span>, is at University of Florida in
        Gainesville. Contrary to the general opinion, we have very good schools
        in Florida. In fact, I believe they are equal to any of the northern
        colleges.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have had a wonderful winter with the weather perfect. It doesn't
        seem possible that there has been snow banks and ice anywhere, or that
        any one has had to shovel coal, ashes and snow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wouldn't it be fine to hold a cousins reunion in St. Petersburg? Now
        that <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Aunt Kate</a> and Uncle
        <span wc_id="I787">Lish Horton</span> have a home here, Ruth and
        Merritt, my <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">mother</a> and <a href=
        "CampbellThomas1856.html">father</a>, the Pratts and ourselves are all
        housed, we could take care of you all. One day we called together
        twenty-six relatives for a picnic and swim at the beach on the Gulf of
        Mexico. What town up North could call a crowd of that number together
        upon an hour's notice?

        1. 1925 was within the heyday of "Jim Crow" laws in the South, so movie
        audiences had to be segregated. And, as Cousin Eva HOOKER Hills letter
        on pg, 5 illustrates, the KKK was alive and well in Pennsylvania (and
        Middle Atlantic states) then.

        and Cousin <a href="VaughanEmma1854.html">Em Congdon</a> with us at the
