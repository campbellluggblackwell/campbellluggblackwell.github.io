        Dear Cousins Campbell:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Some are born into good families; some achieve good families; and some
        -- are adopted bodily into good families! Modesty forbids my entering a
        claim on the first count, although I am just in receipt of a letter
        from a professional genealogist in Washington who assures me that he
        can connect me up with the "famous Loop (Leupe, Loope, Loupe) family of
        England, the Netherlands and France,-- for a consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the second count I can speak freely. I have achieved a fine family,
        known to most of you: My wife, <span wc_id="I1578">Agnes</span>,
        unsurpassed in womanly virtues and attributes, save perhaps for health
        alone, and two lovely daughters, The elder, <span wc_id=
        "I1579">Marget</span>, after graduating from the local schools and the
        Walnut Lane School for Girls in Philadelphia studied for two years in
        the Institute of Musical Art of the City of New York<sup>1</sup>,
        specializing in piano, and is now working for her degree in music in
        the School of Education of the New York University. The younger,
        <span wc_id="I1583">Jane</span>, our baby, is still in the grammar
        school and is as lively and healthy a specimen of young girlhood as you
        could wish to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, if you adopt me into your illustrious family, these must come too.
        With this single condition, I am willing and honored to accept your
        wonderful invitation, for during my professional life I have had
        occasion to look into several members of your family, I may say that I
        have INSIDE information<sup>2</sup>, and I know that it is good and one
        with which I am glad to be more closely aligned.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current year has been marked in our immediate family by the death
        of my <span wc_id="I1574">mother</span>, who lived with us. We can only
        be thankful that her declining years were passed in comfort and that
        she was spared the frequently prolonged suffering of a malignant
        disease of the throat.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        As a newcomer, I will not trespass further on your time and space, but
        will thank you sincerely and wish you all well during the coming year.
      </p>
