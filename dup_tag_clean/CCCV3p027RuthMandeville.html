        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        This is my first letter and you'll probably hope it will be the last
        when I tell the happenings in our family during the past year - it will
        sound like a medical journal.
      </p>
      <p>
        To plunge right in - <span wc_id="I1544">mother</span> had the
        misfortune to fracture her hip twelve weeks ago; but, aided by her
        usual indomitable courage, is recovering rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1545">Pearl</span> was operated upon for goiter last
        November - and last Tuesday another operation, appendix this time, was
        necessary. <span wc_id="I1552">Joe's wife</span> and I drove over to
        Auburn to see her and found her doing splendidly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1551">Joe</span>, <span wc_id="I1565">Jerome</span> and I
        are still intact. As a matter of fact, I had ordered the knives
        sharpened for the removal of my tonsils this month, when, at the
        crucial moment, <span wc_id="I1563">Billy</span>, our older son, burst
        forth with chicken pox. Yesterday <span wc_id="I1564">David</span>
        acquired them.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter whether it's a case of chicken pox or temper, when David does
        anything, he does it thoroughly. For the benefit of those who don't
        know, Billy, Jr. is six and a half years old, and David Campbell two
        and a half. Need I say that I am usually busy?
      </p>
      <p>
        This year <span wc_id="I1560">Bill</span> has carried the burden of our
        civic duties. He is on the Board of Education, has offices in several
        clubs and is always called on for active service in the city drives. I
        fear that most of my spare moments are spent, for my own pleasure, in
        reading.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would love to have any or all of the cousins come to see us. Cousin
        <a href="BuckMyra1884.html">Myra Buck</a> Seiders surprised me with a
        visit not long ago. Please follow her example.
      </p>
      <p>
        Love to all the cousins,
      </p>
