        My dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Knowing by past experience that if my letter is not on time my <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a> will call me down, and since
        it's snowy and cold today - a real March day - and there is no going to
        church for country people<sup>1</sup>, I am taking this "Sabbath Day",
        as my mother would say, to write you. I feel that I am not capable of
        doing justice to either you or myself, just at present. I am not very
        strong and am very nervous.
      </p>
      <p>
        A letter from <span wc_id="I1505">Roswell Young</span> says, "Write the
        little things of family life". One of the big things of my life was
        when I could go to Elmira and visit my much loved <span wc_id=
        "I1493">Cousin Lou</span>. On one of these visits Roswell went to a
        picnic, his mother packing his lunch basket and sending one of her best
        solid silver spoons. When he returned, the spoon was missing. She
        talked to him very seriously, and tried to impress the fact that it was
        one of her best. That night he found it in his trouser pocket, and
        bringing it to her he said, "There's your old best spoon!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Next day at lunch <span wc_id="I1501">Ethel</span> announced that she
        was going to <a href=
        "http://www.joycetice.com/postcard/roricks1.htm">Roricks</a> that
        afternoon, and not to school. Her mother said,"No, Ethel, not today".
        Whereupon she set up a big cry. Her <a href=
        "YoungPhilip1866.html">father</a> got up from the table and
        administered a spank that took all thought of Roricks out of Ethel's
        mind, I am sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my family a good many things have happened in the past year. In May
        it was necessary for me to go to the Arnot-Ogden Hospital at Elmira.
        <span wc_id="I1292">William</span> went with me and came every week I
        was there. <span wc_id="I1250">Jessie</span> came from Binghamton, and
        <a href="GoodrichFrances1871.html">Frances</a> and <span wc_id=
        "I1285">Isabelle</span> were there the day I wanted my friends most,
        and Isabelle and Frances came every day I was there. The Elmira cousins
        were most kind. <span wc_id="I1477">Carrie Campbell</span>,
        <span wc_id="I1544">Grace</span>, <span wc_id="I1595">Treva</span>,
        <span wc_id="I677">Nan Pepper</span>, <span wc_id="I693">Fannie
        Monroe</span> and her two sons<sup>2</sup>. Treva and her little
        <span wc_id="I1596">daughter</span> brought me a box of candy at two
        different times. Cards and letters came from everyone of my cousins
        except one, I think, and from lots of the second cousins and friends.
        Cousin <a href="CraneJennie1852.html">Jennie Bosard</a> wrote me
        several times. Flowers, four dozen beautiful roses, came from "the
        three Selphs<sup>3</sup>". When my nurse brought them to my room she
        said, "That fellow must be a millionaire."

        <span wc_id="I1577">Dr. Loop</span><sup>4</sup> said to me one day,
        "<a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> must think a lot of
        you. He writes me every day asking me to tell him just how you are, and
        he says that you are one of his favorite cousins." I think the Campbell
        cousins ought to be thankful to have so wonderful a surgeon in the
        family as Dr. Ross G. Loop. A good many know him by experience.
        <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie Congdon</a> spent an hour
        with me there.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I left the hospital I went down to <a href=
        "GoodrichFrances1871.html">Frank</a>'s for a week before I was able to
        ride home. <a href="CongdonEmma1848.html">Em Buck</a> came and spent
        the day with me. I always did have a soft spot in my heart for Em.
      </p>
      <p>
        I left a good woman to keep house. She stayed eight months.
        <span wc_id="I1250">Jessie</span> and family were home in August for a
        month. The babies enjoy the farm. <span wc_id="I1256">Tom</span> helps
        Grandpa Bill<sup>5</sup> drive the truck. We bought a pony he will
        enjoy this year when he comes. <span wc_id="I1262">Anne Betty</span> is
        a favorite in the family, I fear, as she is the only girl. Baby
        <span wc_id="I1266">Henry</span> is a lively two year old. <span wc_id=
        "I1276">Elizabeth</span> was here for a short stay in November.
        <span wc_id="I1278">Joseph</span> is a fine scholar for an eight year
        old, and <span wc_id="I1282">David</span> is a lively boy of one year.
      </p>
      <p>
        In October I went to Binghamton where Jessie lives. While there we
        drove down the Lackawanna Trail to Great Bend. We were going to New
        Milford, but the day was cold, and <span wc_id="I1251">Walter</span>
        had tire trouble, so we went back. From there we went on to Elizabeth,
        one hundred miles farther. Was there one week, then they took me for
        several nice rides. We went to Herkimer, eighty miles farther north,
        where William has a niece, and we spent a very pleasant day there. The
        roads are real roads in that country. I had the pleasure of riding on
        the "Million Dollar Highway"<sup>6</sup> while there, a few miles
        anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have seen "<a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_%281924_film%29">America</a>" and
        "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Covered_Wagon">The Covered
        Wagon</a>" this winter.
      </p>
      <p>
        In January William went to the Arnot-Ogden Hospital for an operation
        which was successful. He is feeling well now, only not strong enough to
        do much work. I went with him and spent the nights with <span wc_id=
        "I1285">Isabelle</span>. She can cook like any of the Campbells, and is
        a good housekeeper although she is a teacher by profession. Her
        <a href="GoodrichFrances1871.html">mother</a> was in Osceola at that
        time<sup>7</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have just bought a six cylinder up-to-date Reo truck<sup>8</sup>. It
        is very comfortable to ride in. I go quite a bit when our mud roads
        permit. William has a rather extensive milk route.
      </p>

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        4. Dr. Ross Loop was not a "blood relative" but he was considered part
        of the family because he was a half-brother of Cousin Stella LOOP
        Hooker Wilbur.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. After my mother's father died, she was raised by her aunt, Inez, and
        husband William Boller (my namesake). Because both my grandfathers had
        died before my parents married, Billy Boller served as a surrogate
        grandfather to my siblings and me, hence to us he was always "Grampa
        Bill".
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Countless stretches of highway all over the country, being paved for
        the first time, were locally called by that name. In this case, I
        suspect she was referring to NY5 thru the Mohawk Valley, which followed
        the route of the Erie Canal and in turn was followed by the NY Thruway.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Isabelle's monther, Frances (Goodrich) Hoyt, spent time in Osceola
        because <u>her</u> mother, Elizabeth (Batterham) Goodrich, was
        suffering from dementia. The Goodriches lived in a home built for them
        by their son-in-law, Lee Smith Tubbs. Lee built it for them just across
        the street from where he and Mary (Goodrich) Tubbs lived.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. I remember that truck, It was still running 20 years later. I have
        photos of it -- and of the pony with my eldest brother riding her.

        We work the farm, keep two hired men, who make lots of work. William
        makes it as easy for me as possible. He gets the breakfast, has the
        washing and ironing done, buys bread<sup>9</sup>, and each Saturday a
        school girl helps me all day.

        Cousin <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">Mary Shipman</a> wrote me
        February twelfth, as she always does on my mother's birthday. It's a
        thought I appreciate most sincerely. Cousin <a href=
        "CampbellKate1853.html">Kate</a> has sent cards this winter from the
        South, as have Cousin <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a> and
        <a href="VaughanEmma1854.html">Em Congdon</a>. While we haven't the
        sunshine or flowers of the Sunny South, we did have the eclipse, the
        earthquake and the "big" snow. "Count your many blessings".
      </p>
      <p>
        I called at <a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">Mark Seely</a>'s Thursday
        evening while William was at the barber shop. We all went to a warm
        sugar social<sup>10</sup> given in the hall by the "Presbyterian Ladies
        Aid". <a href="SeelyLena1873.html">Lena</a><sup>11</sup> and I are both
        very hard of hearing. We have good visits with pencil and
        tablet<sup>12</sup>. Most of the Campbells who are left in Nelson are
        working to keep the church our Grandfather helped to build alive. The
        congregation is small. We have a very fine minister. It seems to me it
        is a duty for each one of us to do our best to help. I believe we shall
        have it to answer for if we through carelessness, selfishness and
        don't-care-ness let the church go down. I am sure our grandparents and
        parents would think the same way.<sup>13</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="LoopStella1863.html">Stella</a> is very thoughtful of other
        shut-ins. A letter, card, or magazine or book finds its way to our mail
        box very often. I try to do the same by her. <a href=
        "BosardAnna1860.html">Ann Owlett</a> sent several cards while on her
        visit this winter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I called on <a href="TubbsAnn1855.html">Ann Van Dusen</a> a few weeks
        ago. She is very sad and lonely. <a href="SeelyAda1858.html">Ada</a>
        has had a misfortune, too. We Sympathize <span class=

      </p>
      <p>
        I attended the Cousins Dinner at <span wc_id="I1057">Laura
        Mowrey</span>'s.<sup>15</sup> We had a good time, of course. Hope to be
        present at <a href="TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie Clark</a>'s for the
        next one. You have such a lovely, big home, Minnie. Why not ask the
        second cousins?<sup>16<sup></sup></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Last Sunday <span wc_id="I1251">Walter</span> and <span wc_id=
        "I1256">Tom</span> came from Binghamton for the day. While their stay
        was very short, we enjoyed every minute of it. Tom went to the attic
        for butternuts, and to the cellar for apples; also a little bit of eats
        went in the bag. Taste better when they come from
        Granny's<sup>17</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that I have done more than my duty this time. The day of the
        arrival of the cousin's letters will be a day of rejoicing for us.

        9. In the 1920s, as before, most farm wives baked their own bread. So,
        in buying bread with hard earned money, he was lightening the burden on
        her.
      </p>
      <p>
        10. At this time of year, Nelson-ites, and most country folks along the
        state line on both sides of the border, were boiling down sap to make
        maple syrup and maple sugar. What was this "warm sugar social" that
        apparently was held at the Odd Fellows Hall (as were Campbell reunions
        on rainy days)? Presumably it was similar to an ice cream social,
        strawberry shortcake event. Old newspapers explain: <span style=
        "font-style: italic;">They make "warm sugar" by boiling down sap to a
        syrup and beating it into a creamy sugar. It is eaten by the
        party-goers on buttered buns. Pickles and coffee whet the taste</span>.
        My mother, who was from Nelson, didn't do that with the new syrup.
        Instead of beating it, she served warm syrup in individual, small bowls
        -- along with fresh from the oven, baking powder biscuits.
      </p>
      <p>
        11. On their mother's sides, Lena and Inez were 1st cousins once
        removed. But in addition, Lena was the widow of David Goodrich, brother
        of Inez' sister-in-law, Frances GOODRICH Hoyt.
      </p>
      <p>
        12. Lena was profoundly deaf after having scarlet fever as a child. My
        sister told me about having many of these writing pad conversations
        with Lena. As a teenager, she resented being delegated as the one to
        "go visit Aunt Lena" when my parents and siblings would visit Nelson.
      </p>
      <p>
        13. It saddens me that the Beecher's Island Presbyterian church
        building was allowed to decay to the point it had to be torn down. Our
        early Campbells and sons-in-law Sam and John Hazlett put so much blood,
        sweat and tears into building it, and it meant so much to them. I'm
        sure Inez was right that her aunts and uncles, and grandparents, would
        have been disappointed if a crystal ball had shown them it's fate. But
        most of the decline of Nelson, and similar small communities, was an
        almost inevitable result of Henry Ford and the Model-T. And when most
        of Nelson's homes were demolished to make way for the lake and the
        residents scattered, maintaining two separate congregation ---
        Methodist and Presbyterian, became impractical. The Beecher's Island
        Presbyterian Church was the one my mother attended until she married
        and moved away. It meant a lot to her, which is why she made a painting
        of it.. But she was also linked to the Methodist church building, which
        was moved from the South Side to the "New Nelson" and is used by the
        merged, non-denominational congregation. Her maternal grandfather, Rev.
        Henry Goodrich was it's minister, and the building has a stained glass
        window in his memory. For more detail, see <a href=
        "http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Ecapane/BeechersIsland.html">
        Beecher's Island</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        14. Ann lost her husband and youngest son. Ada's house burned down (See
        her letter on page 2.)
      </p>
      <p>
        15. The 1924 "Cousins Dinner" was held at Charlie Congdon's summer
        home, near Stroudsburg, PA. That was the farthest from Nelson one was
        ever held, and further than some of the "First Cousins" (i.e.grand
        children of Joseph and Ann Clinch Campbell) were willing or able to
        travel, so Laura held an alternate one, at her farm in Farmington Twp..
      </p>
      <p>
        16. The Cousins Dinner was created by and for the 30 grandchildren of
        Joseph and Ann Clinch Campbell. Some were uncomfortable with the
        "anyone can come" Campbell Reunions, which sometimes had several
        hundred attendees. These 30 "First Cousins" all grew up in Nelson,
        knowing and playing with each other. The dinner's were intentionally
        exclusive. Only the First Cousins were welcome, but it was up to the
        hostess of a dinner as to who else would be invited. They waited until
        the First Cousins were dying out, to start including their children,
        the "second cousins." Either they waited too long to start involving
        their successors, or the fact that the next generation was scattered
        all over the country and had never met more that a few of the others
        may have been why the Cousins Dinners came to an end a few years
        later..
      </p>
      <p>
        17. She was Tom's great-aunt, but was apparently referring to herself
        as his "Granny" to match her husband being called "Grampa Bill". She
        died before I was born and I don't recall how my siblings referred to
        her. .
