        The 42nd annual reunion of the <a href="BeechersIsland">Beecher
        Island</a> Campbell Clan, was held in the I.O.O.F. Hall in Nelson, Pa.
        on Aug. 16, 1934.
      </p>
      <p>
        The meeting was called to order by the Pres. <span wc_id="I1896">Clyde
        Campbell</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Election of officers followed by group singing amd remarks by <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Wm. Selph</a>. Greetings were sent by
        <span wc_id="I1878">Harry Campbell</span>, <a href=
        "BuckGeorge1877.html">Geo. Buck</a>, and <span wc_id="I532">Clifford
        Young</span>. There were four cousins of the <a href=
        "CampbellJoseph1793.html">Jos. Campbell</a> family present out of the
        eight living cousins.<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The clan decided to send flowers to <a href="HoytInez1871.html">Inez
        Boller</a> who was very ill at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ShimpanMabel1875.html">Mabel Shipman</a> Shaw gave a talk on a
        recent trip to Europe and <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Mrs. Kate
        Horton</a> in her usual pleasing manner recited a poem of her own pen.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1760">Harry Kemp</span> was made chairman of a committee
        to look up family tree<sup>2</sup> and <span wc_id="I693">Mrs. Fannie
        Monroe</span> will head the com. to look up Genealogy of the Hazlett
        Branch.<sup>3</sup>

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. In these minutes, Mayme is using "cousins" to refer to those "1st"
        cousins that were grandchilden of Joseph and <a href=
        "ClnchAnn1804.html">Ann Clinch</a> Campbell.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        2. It's hard to know the scope of what Mayme was refering to. In 1924
        Will Selph had given out more than 100 copies of a beautifully drawn
        chart (in a style rather like a spreadsheet). And more than 100 of
        Joseph and Ann Clinch Campbell's descendants had copies of the 4 volums
        of the Campbell Cousins Correspondence -- including Harry Campbell,
        George Buck, Clifford Young, Kate Horton & Mabel Shaw. But by now there
        was another generation to add. However, many of those now active in the
        reunions (including Clyde Campbell and Harry Kemp) were descendants of
        Joseph's brother, <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James Campbell</a>
        and his wife, <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary Blackwell</a> who
        was Ann's half-sister. And presumably there were still reunion
        attendees who were descendants of Ann's and Mary's great-uncle,
        <a href="LuggCharles1791.html">Charles B. Lugg</a>
      </p><br>
      <p>
        3. Mayme and Fannie were descendants of Samuel & <a href=
        "CampbellSarah1777.html">Sarah Campbell</a> Hazlett. But many of the
        attendees were descendants of <a href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John</a>
        and <a href="CampbellJane1794.html">Jane Campbell</a> Hazlett. It's
        legit to group them as "the Hazlett Branch" because Sam and John were
        brothers, and Sarah and Jane, sisters. But I suspect they had forgotten
        about Sarah, Joseph & Jane's, sister, <a href=
        "CampbellMary1779.html">Mary Campbell</a>, who married a different
        <a href="HazlettJohn1783.html">John Hazlett</a>. As far as we know,
        that John Hazlett was unrelated to Sam and therefore they wouldn't be
        part of "the Hazlett branch." But because they lived in south-western
        PA, I suspect that by 1934 those Hazletts had been forgotten. As were
        the western PA descendants of <a href="CampbellJohn1781.html">John</a>
        and <span wc_id="I13">Elizabeth Bell</span> Campbell.
