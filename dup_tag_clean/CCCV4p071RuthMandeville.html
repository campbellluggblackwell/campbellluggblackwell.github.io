        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        A hospital doesn't seem a very cheering place from which to send
        greetings - however, it is simply that the Mandeville's <span class=
        "Annotation">[sic]</span> have lost another pair of tonsils;
        <span wc_id="I1563">Billy</span>'s this time. He is getting along
        splendidly, particularly with the sign language. In a few days everyone
        will hear all the gory details. His mind seems to work that way.
        Sometime in the future, yellow journalism will have a first class
        reporter. When <span wc_id="I1560">Bill</span> and I returned from a
        trip recently, his first question was, "Did you see any nice
        accidents?" - on answering "No", he said, "Gee, didn't you even see a
        train wreck?" The trip apparently was a failure as far as he was
        concerned - but not for us. Bill had Grippe and a few days in Atlantic
        City did him worlds of good.<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our interests haven't changed much since last year, centering in the
        boys of course. Billy is in the second grade and admits that he is one
        of the star pupils only the teacher doesn't know it. It happens that
        way sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1564">David</span> is an angelic looking boy (if you
        don't look too long). Those who remember <span wc_id=
        "I1565">Jerome</span> in his hectic infancy may have some idea of
        David. Suffice it to say, ours is not a quiet household.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bill is, as always, busy with business and public affairs. I think
        everyone knows that <span wc_id="I1551">Joe</span> and he are in the
        same law office.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I hear of how active Cousin <span wc_id="I927">Anna Buck</span> is
        in her community, I feel how very useless I am in mine Some day I hope
        to do something worth mentioning.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are all very thankful that <span wc_id="I1549">Henry</span>,
        <span wc_id="I1545">Pearl</span>'s son, pulled through a very critical
        illness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1544">Mother</span>, aside from colds, has been well this
        winter. At present her house is torn up from top to bottom being
        redecorated. If she doesn't write you will know the cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        Love and greetings to all,
      </p>
