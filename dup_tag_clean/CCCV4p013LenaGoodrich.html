        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Cheer Up! Spring is coming. A few birds have made their appearance,
        although they departed immediately; and the usual letter reminding us
        of our duty to the "Campbell Clan", has arrived. We regret that it was
        necessary to reprove us for our negligence. I had not forgotten that
        the letter was due but was thinking of it and wondering what I could
        write that would be of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        My life is such an uneventful one. Have you ever stopped to think what
        it would mean to be deprived of the pleasure of conversing with one's
        friends, never to hear a word spoken a sermon preached, a church bell
        or a message over the telephone or the radio? Can you doubt that it is
        very hard task for me to write a letter, when I live in an entirely
        different world? But I must not weary you with my trials, - I have much
        to be thankful for. <a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">Father</a>,
        <span wc_id="I973">mother</span>, and myself have had a very
        comfortable winter; no serious illness or trouble except our anxiety
        over <a href="SeelyAda1858.html">Aunt Ada</a> who has been ill all
        winter.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        We were very sorry to hear of the tragic death of Cousin <a href=
        "YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil Young</a> and wish to extend our sympathy
        to the family.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was not able to attend the Cousins Dinner at Cousin <a href=
        "TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie Clark</a>'s but father and mother went
        and reported a fine time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We think that the picture of the first Cousins of the <a href=
        "CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph Campbell</a> Family is splendid, -
        every face being good.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are eager to see the picture of the whole company which we expect to
        find in the next Volume of the "Campbell Cousins Correspondence".
        Cousin Will is certainly a very resourceful person to think of and
        carry out so many interesting things for our pleasure.
