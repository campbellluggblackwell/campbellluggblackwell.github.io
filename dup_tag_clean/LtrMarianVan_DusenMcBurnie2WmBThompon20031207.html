        Glad to hear have some more relatives -- I was wondering how you know
        Lula Moore. The only one by that name that I know, is my husband,
        <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/McBurnie-64">Gordon</a>'s, niece
        that lives near Spokane, Wash. Is that the same person?<sup>1</sup>

        I've never been to a Campbell Reunion, but every other year we do have
        a Hall-Van Dusen one,<sup>2</sup> usually at my <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Van_Dusen-517">sister</a>'s daughter's.
        Those are always fun. I don't think we have discovered any real
        criminals either!<sup>3</sup>

        My Dad, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Van_Dusen-516">Ross Van
        Dusen</a>, died at the age of 31 yrs. of spinal meningitis. I was only
        8 months old at the same time, so I have no recollection of him at all.
        Also I was only 2 yrs old when <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Steadman-726">mom</a> married <a href=

        1. I didn't know Lula Moore. Probably I saw a post from her mentioning
        Gordon on a message board. At the time that was the primary way for
        genealogy hobbists to communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Marian's letter was in response to one I sent as a "first contact"
        letter inviting her to the 2004 Campbell Reunion, saying "Hi" and
        introducing myself and the reunion.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Her mention of criminals was in response to a comment I often made
        in first contact letters about so far not having discovered any horse
        thieves in the family tree.

        This was a very brief marriage, & I have no recollection of him,
        either. However <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Tubbs-258">Johnny Tubbs</a> (no
        relation)<sup>4</sup> was the Step-Dad I remember. He was a great Dad,
        & he & Mom were married about 1929 (April (7th). I was 6 yrs. old at
        the time. I don't have their parents' names, but I know Johnny had a

        My sister Helen & I both out of Osceola & somewhere along the way, as
        we closed up my mom's house after her death, I think in Sept, of 1972
        -- However I'm not sure of the date since the family Bible disappeared
        in all the moves we have made & all the information was recorded in
        that. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful, but if I find any of that
        information, I'll let you know.

        4. Marian had no way of knowing, but John J. Tubbs and Otis B. Tubbs
        <u>were</u> related -- third cousins, connected two ways: both were

        Helen can tell you when they left Osceola. We left Osceola in Oct of
        1944 after my husband was discharged from the Air Force (served 4Â½
        years).<sup>10</sup> We moved to Rhode Island where we raised
        potatoes.<sup>11</sup> We lived there in West Kingston, R I until Oct.

          10.During WW2, most enlistments and draft obligations were extended
          "for the duration" -- i.e. until the war ended. Perhaps Gordon was
          wounded and received a medical discharge. Or, since he was in the
          Army Air Corps he may have been on a flight crew and released because
          of the number of combat missions flown or hours of combat flight
          time. They used complex formulas that differed for fighter and bomber
          units, theater of war, and year that governed <a href=

          flight crew rotation</a>, and as the manpower supply increased,
          influenced release.
