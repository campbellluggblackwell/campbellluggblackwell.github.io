      <p>
        Dear Cousins and Sisters:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> has urged me "to
        be on time" with this letter, but I have had in mind this thought, -- I
        would celebrate the fourth of April by writing a letter; -- it being my
        birthday, also our wedding anniversary. I am sixty-four years old, and
        have been married forty-one years today.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The weather is fine, but the roads are very bad, -- snow, water and
        mud<sup>1</sup>. We have had but little snow compared to other winters;
        none but little flurries until the tenth or twelfth of February.
      </p>
      <p>
        We, as farmers, are quite busy at present, making maple sugar and
        syrup. Wish some of you were here "right now", -- you might have all
        the warm sugar and Jackwax<sup>2</sup> you could get away with.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am glad so many of our younger Cousins are coming in line, and I hope
        each letter may bring new ones to the front. We knew nothing of most of
        our Western people, as well as some nearer by; we want to be a real
        old-fashioned united family and these letters seem to be the only
        gateway.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish to say, I live on the "Marks Farm," -- a part of
        Uncle&nbsp;<a href="CampbellWilliam1822.html">William Campbell</a>'s
        farm, and will be glad to see any of you at any time. How about it
        <a href="CampbellWilliam1864.html">Willie Campbell, Jr.</a> and
        <span wc_id="I916">William, 3rd</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are sorry to know some of our second Cousins have been called home
        such as <span wc_id="I654">"Little John" Hazlett</span><sup>3</sup>,
        <span wc_id="I1891">Hattie Campbell</span> and <span wc_id="I1708">Emma
        Parks</span>. We are all passing along;-- we cannot say who will be
        next.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am glad Cousin Will was so fortunate in securing
        officers<sup>4</sup>; glad to meet you. We will all try to help you as
        best we can.
      </p>
      <p>
        My prayer is that we may all be spared and be able to come to the desk
        and join in the net issue of this letter writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        With much love,
      </p>

    <div class="Footnote">
      1. Few roads were paved back then - wbt.<br>
      <br>
      2.When boiling down the maple syrup further to make maple sugar, you
      could take a spoonful of the liquid and pour it onto the snow. It would
      instantly chill into a waxy, sweet substance that could be chewed. But if
      allowed to thaw, it would become watery again - wbt.<br>
      <br>
      3. In addition to being a second cousin of Anna et al., John was also a
      brother-in-law of Cousin Jud Seely - wbt.<br>
      <br>
      4. Officers of the Campbell Cousins Correspondence Club - wbt.
