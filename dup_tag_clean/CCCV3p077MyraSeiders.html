        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Who cares whether I begin housecleaning next week or finished last
        week? Whether our garden is up or not plowed yet? My first thought was
        that since so little of real interest has happened in our family this
        year my mite might detract rather than add to the general pleasure of
        reading the Correspondence Book. But if Cousin Will Selph can be
        patient in jogging our memory, surely I am chagrined at the thought of
        being a "ditcher"<sup>1</sup>, and certainly I am no "conscientious
        objector" to such a splendid idea as the Correspondence Club.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently spent three weeks in Watkins with <a href=
        "CongdonEmma1848.html">Mother</a>. It had been a year and a half since
        I had been there, so it was quite a treat. I saw very few relatives; in
        fact Aunt <span wc_id="I1544">Grace Carey</span> and <span wc_id=
        "I1559">Ruth Mandeville</span> were all I did see. I had hoped to see
        <span wc_id="I1545">Pearl Wise</span>, but she "inadvertantly"
        <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> decided to have her appendix
        removed at just that time, so we missed each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        The past year with us has been generally uneventful. To some of you the
        great sorrow of death has come. How well we know how to sympathize with
        you and the meaning of your heartache! Not every year has treated us so
        kindly.
      </p>
      <p>
        We thoroughly enjoyed our first attendance at the Cousins Dinner last
        fall when everything was so gorgeous in its autumn dress. <a href=
        "CongdonThomas1850.html">Uncle Ed</a>'s and <a href=
        "VaughanEmma1854.html">Aunt Em</a>'s much too brief visit with us is
        like a dream.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last week we attended the launching of the airplane carrier,
        Saratoga<sup>2</sup>. I was going to say we fortunately were given
        tickets, but when you know that about thirty thousand others had
        tickets, the fortune seems more casual. However, it was a wonderful
        sight to watch that giant ship, nearly seven hundred feet long, slide
        down the incline into the water. It is a marvel how man could devise
        ways and means to handle something like thirty thousand tons as easily
        as if it were a toy. In place of the customary champagne of
        pre-Volstead<sup>3</sup> days, mineral water was used for the
        christening.
      </p>
      <p>
        May we not hope to see some of you this summer? It is hardly probable
        that we shall be able to attend the reunion this year, much as we
        should like to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        To each of you and yours we wish a full measure of success, health and
        happiness during the coming year.
      </p>
      <p>
        With kindest regards to all,

        1. I. e. someone who joins in making plans with a group, then, at the
        last minute, "ditches" them and does not participate.

        2. The "father" of sea planes, naval aviation, and aircraft carriers
        (among other things) was <span wc_id="I5115">Glenn Hammond
        Curtiss</span>. He's in our family tree because he is "connected" to
        us, even though he is not a Campbell, Lugg, Blackwell or Hammond "by
        blood." His mother, Lua A. Andrews, was a granddaughter of Harvey
        Andrews (1801 - 1868) by his first wife, Elizabeth Bradey. Harvey's 2nd
        wife, by whom he had 3 children, was <span wc_id="I40">Jane
        Hazlett</span>.
      </p>

        3. "The Volstead Act" was the commonly used name for 1919's "National
        Prohibition Act", which put into law the 18th Amendment..
