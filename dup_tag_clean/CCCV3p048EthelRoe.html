        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        If I could have the pleasure of visiting any or all of you, I can
        assure you it would undoubtedly be hard to get a word in edgewise, but
        when it comes to writing I certainly fail to qualify. However, I can't
        pass up this opportunity, and I want at least to send greetings to you
        all and wish that we might see more of you this coming year.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was so sorry to have missed <span wc_id="I1703">Ruth Mitchell</span>,
        <span wc_id="I1595">Treva Hazlett</span> and their husbands whose cards
        we found upon returning from the lake<sup>1</sup> in August.
      </p>
      <p>
        My <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">father</a>, <span wc_id=
        "I1502">Jay</span> and I went to Hornell week before last to hear my
        brother <span wc_id="I1537">Edward</span> in a joint recital with a New
        York baritone. It was a great success, and I don't mind saying we are
        pretty proud of my brother's progress in the musical world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jay and I are especially fond of music and are thoroughly enjoying our
        radio. Some nights we do not know to which station to turn, there are
        so many good things in the air. It has been one of our chief amusements
        this winter, and we have had a great many radio parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the best times I have had in several years was a get-together
        party at the lake last summer. It was the first time my three brothers
        and I have been together since before <span wc_id=
        "I1532">Clifford</span> went over-seas. We call it "Old Home Week" and
        expect to make it an annual affair. Each one stays as long as he can.
        Each one of the boys comes home at least twice a year, but seldom at
        the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In October we drove to New York to Clifford's wedding. I often regret
        not having any sisters, but I surely am blessed with some very dear
        sisters-in-law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our trip home over the Storm King Highway is one I wish you all might
        take. We drove up the Hudson, through West Point and over the marvelous
        highway to Newburgh. The road is cut through the rocks. It took years
        to build it and cost millions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our <span wc_id="I1503">little girl</span> is very busy, doing
        splendidly in school and music. She dotes on going to her grandfather's
        to spend the night.

        While I have been writing I have been listening over the radio to John
        Charles Thomas, the famous baritone, and to one of the leading sopranos
        of the Metropolitan Opera Company. She has just finished Schubert's
        Serenade, and it was beautifully clear and sweet.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am looking forward to your letters, and trust that this finds you in
        the best of health, with many years of happiness and prosperity before
        you.
