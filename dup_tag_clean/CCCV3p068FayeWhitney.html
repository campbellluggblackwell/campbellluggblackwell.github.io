        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I have neglected my "cousin letter". You all know at moving time one is
        pretty busy, so I shall have to be excused this time. This is a new
        thing for me, but I shall try to tell you where we live and what we are
        doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have lived "up north" for three years. We like it very much. It is
        very pretty country, all level and and mostly devoted to fruit. We are
        now working on a farm near Medina. The farmers are now spraying their
        trees. This is done three or four times a year. They plow and work
        their orchards until nearly time to pick the fruit. Some of the farmers
        grow peas, tomatoes and pumpkins for the canning factory. They start
        the factory about the middle of July and run it until the holidays.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked in the factory in apple time and enjoyed it very much. I also
        picked cherries, prunes and packed apples. The farmers call it
        "ring-tailing" them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a <span wc_id="I1112">husband</span> and two boys. The
        <span wc_id="I1116">oldest boy</span> works in Medina. The <span wc_id=
        "I1121">other one</span> is on a farm. We are having nice spring
        weather now. The buds are starting. We had lots of snow, and for three
        months the ground was white. Four below zero was the coldest weather we
        had, but that lasted only three or four days at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We live about six miles from Lake Ontario--just a nice drive. Two of my
        brothers<sup>1</sup> work not far from here. I am expecting <a href=
        "BosardAnna1860.html">Mother</a> out to stay for a while. She will
        enjoy it as there are lots of things to see. We have not been to Nelson
        since September, but I am hoping to go in May and bring Mother back
        with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope my letter will not be too late. I do not know that it will be
        very interesting, but maybe I can do better next time. I should very
        much like to have any one of the cousins who are up this way come and
        see us. The door is never locked. I enjoy the letters and hope to get a
        good lot this time.
