      1840)</big></big></big><br></big>

    <div>
      <p>
        <big><big><big>Sam</big></big> <big><big>was born Feb. 29, 1780 in
        Scotland; d. Tioga Co., PA. He married <a href=
        "CampbellSarah1777.html">Sarah "Sally" Campbell</a>, b. 1777 in North
        Ireland or Scotland.</big></big></big>
      </p>
      <p>
        <big><big><big>We're not sure when Sally and Sam married, nor when they
        came to the US .There's a tradition that they were married aboard the
        ship and lived in NJ for a while, but no solid evidence. Some
        researchers believe they married in PA. We know their eldest child,
        Archibald, was born in Lancaster Co., PA in 1803. Sally's brother
        <a href="CampbellJohn1781.html">John</a>, and sisters <a href=
        "CampbellMary1779.html">Mary</a> and <a href=
        "CampbellElizabeth1789.html">Elizabeth</a>, also lived in Lancaster Co.
        John Campbell soon moved to the Pittsburgh area. By 1806, Sam and Sally
        were living on a farm he bought near Stroudsburg, Monroe Co., PA (then
        in Northampton Co.). Stroudsburg borders on NJ, so the oral tradition
        of living in NJ may have been based on that. Sally's sister Mary
        remained in Lancaster Co. all her life. Elizabeth Campbell relocated to
        Nelson.<br></big></big></big>
      </p>
      <p>
        <big><big><big>After moving to Monroe Co. Sam started buying land on
        the north bank of the Cowanesque River, just east of what became the
        Boro of Nelson (originally called <a href=
        "BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's Island</a>), Tioga Co., PA from a
        transient settler, Daniel Strait. At time it was wilderness, with no
        roads and only a few scattered cabins. In 1810, he completed the
        purchase.</big></big></big>
      </p>
      <p>
        <big><big><big>Sally's <a href="CampbellJoseph1748.html">father</a>
        (who came to the US in 1810) and her uncle, <a href=
        "CampbellJohn1761.html">John Campbell</a> (who came in 1776/77), bought
        the island from the Beechers, who moved away. That property was on the
        south bank of the Cowanesque River. It was slightly west of the land on
        the north bank that Sam bought. See <a href=
        "NelsonMap.html">map</a></big></big></big>
      </p><big><big><big></big></big></big>
      <p>
        <big>In Oct. of 1810, Sam, Sally, their 3 children, and Sam's brother
        <a href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John</a>; were joined at his farm near
        Stroudsburg by Sally's parents; her siblings (<a href=
        "CampbellJane1792.html">Jane</a>, <a href=
        "CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph</a> and <a href=
        "CampbellJames1798.html">James Campbell</a>); and&nbsp; her uncle, John
        Campbell. At some point, they all embarked with all their goods and
        livestock, in an amazing journey to Beecher's Island, arriving early in
        1811. There was no road once they left Lawrenceville, PA and started up
        the Cowanesque to Nelson. There was a foot of snow on the ground. They
        had to leave the wagons and walk --- Sally carrying her infant daughter
        Jane Hazlett in her arms.</big>
      </p>
      <p>
        <big><big><big>They arrived to find that the roof of the cabin Sam
        purchased had fallen in, and the log walls were not chinked. Reportedly
        "you could throw a cat through the gaps between the walls." And the
        only a few scraps of rusty metal remained of the sawmill Sam bought.
        Fortunately, the cabin the Campbells purchased, was intact.<br>
        <br>
        We know Sam's parents were named <span wc_id="I15">Robert</span> and
        <span wc_id="I14338">Mary Hazlett</span>, but we know almost nothing
        else about them. According to <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Jane
        CAMPBELL</a> Tubbs, after Sam and his brother John settled in Tioga
        Co., Sam's mother, his sister <span wc_id="I17">Mary</span>, and
        brother <span wc_id="I18">Archibald</span> came to America --- and
        settled in western PA. It's always been a mystery why they did that
        instead of joining Sam and John Hazlett in Nelson.<br>
        <br>
        Some researchers believe they have identified Sam's parents, but the ID
        is uncertain.<br></big></big></big>
      </p>
      <p>
        <big><big><big>Sarah and Sam had 7 children, but 3 died in infancy and
        may not have been named. Those that survived
        were:</big><br></big></big>
