    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Wednesday morning, <span wc_id="I643">E. H.
    Hazlett</span> of Nelson, received the following ominous and startling
    telegram: "Your son died this morning at 3 a.m. Shall we send the remains
    home?" Signed Clark, surgeon, and dated Chickamauga Park, August 30,
    1898.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernest H. Hazlett, son of Mr. and Mrs. E. H. Hazlett, of
    Nelson, was a young man well known in the Cowanesque valley and was born in
    Nelson twenty-six years ago on the 30th of June last.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it was known that Capt. Gambell of Wellsboro, was
    raising a company of men to defend the honor of our nation he was one of
    the first to enroll, successfully passed the medical examination and was
    mustered into the service as a private in Co. K, 5th Regt., Pa. Vols. The
    company was immediately ordered to report at Chickamauga Park and in the
    later part of July, arrived at that pest-hole of our otherwise glorious
    nation. What has followed has become a matter of history. Our sons and
    brothers are being sent home dead or physical wrecks and all because of the
    incompetency, ignorance and carelessness of men who have precious lives in
    their charge.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The country has fixed the responsibility. The people and
    the press of the land lay the condition of affairs where it belongs, to the
    secretary of war and the adjutant-general. Secretary Alger says that the
    men receive as good fare as he himself. Alger stops at the Fifth Avenue
    Hotel in New York while visiting Camp Wikoff, while the men are complaining
    of their hard tack, beans, and putrid meat. Mr. McKinley is
    commander-in-chief of the army and the people look anxiously to him to tell
    us who is right, Alger or the soldiers.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why were not these men sent home at the signing of the
    protocol on furloughs, instead of being allowed to remain in these
    disease-breeding camps? The answer to this question is easy: The officers
    desired to remain and show their uniforms to admiring excursionists, even
    at the expense of the lives of their men.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A full account of Pvt. Hazlett's funeral and burial will
    appear in next week's [<small><span style=

    JOURNAL.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a meeting of the citizens held in <span wc_id=
    "I986">Blanchard</span>'s furniture rooms on Wednesday evening, the
    following resolutions were adopted:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereas, God in his mysterious Providence has seen fit
    to remove from our midst our esteemed fellow townsman, Ernest H. Hazlett, a
    private in Co. K, 5th Regt, Pa. Vols., and<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereas, We deeply appreciate his services as a
    representative of our town in upholding the glory of our peerless flag and
    offering to his country the greatest sacrifice that man can give, his life,
    and truly "greater love hath no man:" therefore be it<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved, That we, a committee appointed at a meeting of
    the citizens on Nelson, held on Wednesday evening, August 31, 1898,
    realizing the loss the community has sustained in his untimely death, take
    this manner of expressing our grief, and to the family of the bereaved we
    extend our kindest sympathy and commend them to the care of Him who "doeth
    all things well;" And be it further<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to
    two or more local papers for publication, and a copy suitably engrossed be
    presented to the parents of the deceased.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W. H.
    STEVENS, M.D.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span wc_id=
    "I2369">E. C. BLACKWELL</span><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E. L. MUDGE<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Committee.<br>
    <br>
    [<small><small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Note: From
    a contemporary perspective, it seems curious that the committee felt that
    publishing their resolution in the Elkland <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">Journal</span> and the Mansfield <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">Advertizer</span> or the Wellsboro <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">Agitator,</span> was an effective way to address the
    Ernest's tragic death. The resolution does adequately convey the
    community's sympathy to the parents. But aside from that, what are they
    trying to accomplish? What result do they expect or hope to
    accomplish?&nbsp; They are not demanding an inquiry, or that any action be
    taken. And they are not taking their complaint to their congressman, US
    senators, president, secretary of war, or military officials --- they are
    just going on record as being upset about what happened to their relative
    or neighbor. The reporter expressed much more indignation.
