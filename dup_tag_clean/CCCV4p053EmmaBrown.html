        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        After having been reminded several times that I am behind with my
        letter, will do my best to write a few lines. I picked up my Cousins
        book this morning before I started this letter; they are all such good
        letters that I feel rather small in trying to write&nbsp; because I am
        a poor hand at it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have let our farm for this year and expect to move to Osceola. We
        bought the house and lot known as the Davis property; some of you will
        recognize where it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        My family consists of <span wc_id="I1383">my husband</span>, and two
        children, <span wc_id="I1388">Merle</span>, who is married and has one
        child, <span wc_id="I1390">Franklin</span> by name, and <span wc_id=
        "I1399">Martha</span>. Our daughter, Martha, is teaching at the
        Thornbottom School; some of you will remember where it is.<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        I attended the Cousins Dinner at Aunt <a href=
        "TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie Clark</a>'s last fall and had a very nice
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well I don't know as I can say any more; hoping I am not too late, with
        kindest regards and best wishes to all the Cousins, I remain,<br>
      </p>
