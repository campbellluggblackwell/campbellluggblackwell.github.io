        Dear Cousins-in-law:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        After having delayed this letter as long as I possibly could in the
        hope that I might be excused this time, my inexorable <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">husband</a> still persists in his demand for an
        epistle,which will be, I fear, like some epilogues, somewhat
        superfluous. For with two other members of the family to tell the
        news<sup>1</sup> it is difficult to add much that will be interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as it has been suggested that we write of "everyday
        happenings" (and, after all, what else is there to write about?),
        William may have forgotten to tell you that we are trying to "keep a
        roof over our heads" just now; so if this letter of various remarks
        seems disconnected and betokens a wandering mind, please lay the blame
        on the broad shoulders of the carpenters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other day a newspaper item telling of the blooming of the trees in
        Washington turned our thoughts backward a year and we were again in our
        Capitol City looking at the Lincoln Memorial and the Monument, standing
        in the midst of the beautiful pink blossoms, where we left you last
        year. After the visit to Washington I took another trip. First, I
        visited Springfield, Massachusetts, with friends and attended several
        sessions of the big conference of our church held every four years. All
        the bishops and prominent people are at this gathering, and the great
        Municipal Building was filled. While there I also visited a paper mill
        for the first time, and was much interested in the many processes
        employed in producing all kinds of paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I went to Wheaton College to visit <span wc_id=
        "I1605">Doris</span> and to attend the Annual May Day Pageant. We have
        had no trips this spring, but I hope to visit Doris again next month,
        and am looking forward to this treat.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meantime our hands are being "kept out of mischief " by the
        usual "common round of tasks"--sewing and the inevitable attack of
        housecleaning which breaks out at this time of the year to keep us
        indoors when we would much rather go out and play.

        This year Doris' new experience<sup>2</sup> has kept our minds and
        hands a little busier than usual, and our hearts, too, as many of the
        cousins can realize as the young people grow up. We have enjoyed the
        cousins' visits. <a href="SelphJennie1873.html">Jennie</a> and

        and Cousins <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a> and <a href=

        Our town is growing and progressing: four churches are planning for
        larger buildings, the Women's Club is raising funds for a larger
        clubhouse, and with the new country club and with other interests which
        we have, it's a busy town. Our own church societies carry on a good
        work. William has served on the music committee and we hope that during
        the coming year a new quartette and new organ will give us very good
        music.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have been admiring the florist's windows at this season with their
        Easter displays of azaleas, hyacinths, daffodils, tulips and lillies
        <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>, and we are enjoying our own
        jonquil bed which after the winter's storm is filled with big, golden
        flowers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I shall leave you here. You will be ready by this time, to take a long
        breath before you turn to the next letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        With best wishes to one and all, I am,
