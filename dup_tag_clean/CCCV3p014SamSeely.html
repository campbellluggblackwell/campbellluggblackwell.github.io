          <p>
            Another year has passed and I have been reminded that the time for
            another exchange of letters is approaching - a pleasure to which we
            are all looking forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a wonderful day for this time of year. It seems good after
            such a severe winter. The dirt roads are in fine shape, and land
            will soon be dry enough to work if the good weather continues. In
            fact, some farmers have already been plowing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The general cleaning up, repairing of fences and numerous other
            chores, keeps a farmer always on the job at this season of the
            year.

            We attended the Campbell reunion<sup>2</sup> at Nelson this last
            year, and, I am sorry to say, there were only about sixty members
            present. I can remember when there used to be twice that number.
            But as each year passes, it is bound to bring its joys and sorrows
            to all of us. Hope to see more of the cousins there this year, and
            renew our acquaintance.
          </p>

            These spring days begin to make us think about summer and what we
            shall do when the weather is warm and we can get out to enjoy it.
            Usually we plan on a trip to Pennsylvania, but this year I am
            trying to get my people to come here instead. They haven't said
            that they will come, but I am making my plans for them just the
            same, for I think they will come if they can. There are lots of
            lovely things to do here in warm weather, and I hope they decide to
            come.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can say for my family that we are all well and looking forward to
            the letter, including those from the new members of the C.C.C.

            1. Dora was then a student at Mansfield Normal School, which in
            1927 was renamed Mansfield State Teachers College. Since 1983 it's
            been Mansfield U.

            2. Strange as it seems, CCC letters seldom mentioned the Campbell
            reunions. [The latter were held in the summer.] At their peak, in
            the early 1900s more than 300 sometimes attended.
