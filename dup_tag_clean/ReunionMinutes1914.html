        All then assembled at the Odd Fellow's Hall on account of rain where a

        <span wc_id="I693">Mrs. Will Monroe</span> proved her loyalty to the
        Clan by giving a talk in which she urged all members to be present at
        each and every Reunion. We wish the absent members might have heard it.
        Letters were read from a number of absent friends.

      <p>
        About one-hundred were present. The meeting was adjourned earlier than
