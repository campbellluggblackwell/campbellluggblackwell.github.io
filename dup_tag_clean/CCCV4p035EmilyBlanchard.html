        Dear Cousins:-

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        It is again time to send our annual greetings to the Cousins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although my days are so very interesting to me, it is difficult to
        select the things that might interest others.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our church, our clubs, the Parent Teachers Association and the boys all
        combine to keep us "glad we're livin' ".

        Last summer was full of delightful things,- our trip home which we
        always look forward to, - a visit from Cousin <span wc_id=
        "I1050">Mary</span> and <span wc_id="I1051">Al Snavely</span> and
        wonderful days camping. We camp at a lake near here, so we can all e
        together all summer. Pittsfield is surrounded by beautiful lakes and we
        are planning a cottage of our own to be built soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have all been well this winter and the winter has been unusually
        attractive to the boys -- there has been so much of it, They are
        interested in school and both are doing well. <span wc_id=
        "I988">Junior</span> has just been elected President of his school club
        He is becoming very much interested in the Boy Scouts this Spring, and
        <span wc_id="I992">Marcus</span> is very much disgusted that he isn't
        old enough to join.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just now we are very much interested in getting a little Spring weather
        - but it comes very slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eagerly awaiting your letters, I am
