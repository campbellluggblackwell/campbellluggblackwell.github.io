        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Now as I write, dear cousins, my thoughts go from West to East, from
        North to South, and with fancy unrestrained I can see the scattered
        family I am speaking to "All one body we", but different members. I can
        see each one. Some still with many cares, right in the midst of life
        and its strife. Others there are who have rowed hard, have passed
        midstream, and are nearing the quiet waters of the shore, and my
        picture does not exclude those who have passed to the "Great Beyond".
        We who remain, I believe, are trying to do our best; and it is trying
        for the best that tells the story to the end. "It is the set of the
        sails, and not the gales, that tells which way they go."
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the last day of March, just such a "last of March" day as I
        have seen many times. Particles of snow in the air, a raw north wind
        boisterously proclaiming its virtues in its efforts to dry up the muddy
        streets. But we know April will be here tomorrow, and soon real spring.
        I have really enjoyed the winter. It has not seemed so long. I have
        been able to go out until the last two weeks when I have been afflicted
        with a bad cold, but that is now much better. As soon as the early warm
        days come I'll be running around as usual; and as I look back, I almost
        wonder where the winter has gone.
      </p>

        <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Brother Ed</a> and sister <a href=
        "VaughanEmma1854.html">Em</a> were with me most of the time from
        October first until January fifth. Then <a href=
        "BuckGeorge1877.html">George</a> made me a visit which, though short,
        was sweet; and <a href="BuckMyra1884.html">Myra</a> with her little boy
        was with me through March. I have missed <a href=
        "CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie's</a> frequent visits, but have heard
        from him often.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last summer, like the year before, I was with the children in New
        Jersey, seeing and enjoying many things. Not the least of the pleasures
        were the trips to the shore with Myra and family. I love to sit and
        watch "the wild waves". I did not go in "all over", but I waded in till
        a wave almost knocked me over, when I ran for shore.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy having my own home and quiet, and I love to have you folks
        visit me here. As long as God gives me strength to care for myself, I
        shall remain where I am.

        Not a day passes but I think "Oh, if that cherished companionship of
        nearly half a century might have lasted for but a few more brief
        years!" And then I realize it is a selfish thought. It was not so to
        be. My legacy of life's blessings has been bounteous. If there were not
        some restriction I might not be able to sympathize as I now do with
        some of those whose loved ones have been more untimely called.

        Those of us who were at the Cousins Dinner with Brother Charlie and
        family I think enjoyed the visit, and scenery and the little side trips
        which many took. Those who were with <span wc_id="I1058">Charlie</span>
        <span class="Annotation">[Mowrey]</span> and <span wc_id=
        "I1057">Laura</span> also reported a good time. Some, I hear, attended
        both places<sup>1</sup>. It was a very nice arrangement for those who
        did not go to <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie's</a> to meet
        in another place, and I hope, like the <a href=

        "Old School" and the "New School" Presbyterians</a>, we shall all come
        together again at <a href="TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie Clark</a>'s
        this fall.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Till then goodbye, and love to all,<br>

        1. 1924 was the first, and only, time a "Cousins Dinner" was held that
        far from Nelson. Laura organized an alternate, "local" event for those
        who couldn't, or didn't want to travel to Charlie Congdon's summer home
        near Stroudsburg, PA.
