        To all the Cousins, - Greetings:-

      <p>
        I consider it a privilege as well as a pleasure to contribute a few
        lines each year to the Cousins Book, but some of us let business
        interfere with pleasure and the letter is neglected, - that was my case
        last year but never again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course the most of you know by this time that the distinguished
        travellers <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>, <span wc_id=
        "I787">Lish</span> and <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Kate</a>, have
        just paid a flying visit<sup>1</sup> to the Pacific Coast on account of
        the serious illness of my sister, <span wc_id="I815">Nellie</span>, who
        I am glad to say is now getting along nicely, and while they enjoyed
        the summer like weather of Oregon, I think "the call of the wild" tract
        of Pine Creek<sup>2</sup>, called Lish and his friends and home life of
        home<sup>3</sup> called Kate, so we bade them goodby again and they are
        now on their way back to where the sun rises and the Cousins are more
        numerous, - anyway we have had a very enjoyable visit with a wonderful
        couple who can pack their grips over night and start for the end of the
        trail thousands of miles away and reach it as spry and as fresh as a
        couple of kids.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now that they have proven how easy it is why not some of the rest
        of you Cousins try it out just once an see what a hearty welcome the
        Cousins of Oregon will give you?
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the first of April in Oregon and everything is in bloom, -
        fresh garden truck coming in from the <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_&amp;_Perkins">J & P</a> gardners
        <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> and everything advanced like June
        in Pennsylvania. We do not know the change of seasons except from the
        calendar but sometimes I long for a bob-sled ride on the Dug
        road<sup>4</sup> and a skate on the old <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowanesque_River">Cowanesque</a>, - and
        some day I'm going to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        With best wishes to all, I am,
      </p>

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. Of course by "flying vist" he meant "quick trip". Cross country
        commercial aviation wasn't available. They would have come by train.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Lish was a fisherman.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. This doesn't make sense to me. But handwritten letters were sent to
        Will Selph. He had them typed up for mimeographing, duplicated and
        bond. The original typist may have misread Frank's writing or made a
        transcription error.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. "Dug Road" was a common name in Tioga County's townships and in
        surrounding counties. But Frank was probably referring to the one near
        Westfield, PA. A road cut would be an ideal place for a do it yourself
        bobsled run.
