    <big><big><big>There are many intermarriages throughout the generations,
    but here are the early connections. There's lots of overlap in the family
    trees. Below are selected parts of the trees: first from the CAMPBELLs'
    viewpoint; then from the LUGG perspective; BLACKWELLs' next; then from the
    HAZLETT perspective. For simplicity, only the children that "interconnect"
    are shown. "Sr." and "Jr." were not usually used as part of the names
    below, but are added to help distinguish father from son, where both have
    the same name.<br>

    high, but for those who reached adulthood, a surprising percent lived to

    <big>We haven't been able to trace our Campbells farther back than Joseph
    Campbell, born 1748 in Scotland, died 1822 in Nelson, Tioga Co., PA and his
    brother, John Campbell, born Apr 3, 1761 in Scotland, died Mar 20, 1855, in
    Nelson. We do not know where in Scotland they were born, nor where in
    Scotland Mary Harper was born.<br>
    <br>
    John Campbell (b. 1761) was the apparently first of the family to come to
    America, probably in 1776. He worked as a tailor in Philadelphia and later
    as a land agent. Next to come were some of Joseph's older children. They
    initially settled in Lancaster Co., PA. We don't know exactly when they
    arrived, but Sam and Sally Campbell Hazlett's first child, 
    <!-- {a href="HazlettArchibald1803.html"} -->Archibald<!-- {/a} -->, was
    born in Lancaster Co. in 1803. Joseph Campbell, wife Mary Harper, and their
    younger children lived in N. Ireland for about 10 years before sailing from
    Londonderry to Perth Amboy, NJ in 1810.<br>
    <br>
    John Campbell married a widow, Sarah LUGG Clinch Blackwell in 1818. Sarah
    Lugg was born in Bisley, Gloucestershire, abt. 1777. Sarah first married 
    <!-- {a href="ClinchThomas17xx"} -->Thomas Clinch<!--== {/a} ==-->
     and had a daughter, Ann Clinch, b. 1804 in Avening, Gloucestershire. In
    1804 Sarah, Thomas and infant Ann sailed from Bristol to Philadelphia. On
    board was a widower, <a href="BlackwellEnoch1764ca.html">Enoch
    Blackwell</a> (also from Avening, born there about 1764) his children, and
    several of his siblings. In 1805, Thomas Clinch died in NYC of yellow
    fever. Soon after, Sarah and Enoch married. According to Ann's daughter 
    <!-- {a href="CampbellJane1834.html"} -->Jane CAMPBELL Tubbs<!-- {/a} -->
     (1834 - 1916), Ann was given to Enoch's brother 
    <!-- {a href="BlackwellPeter1779.html:} -->Peter Blackwell<!-- {/a} -->
     and raised near New Hope, PA. But the late 
    <!-- {a href="MaugeriStella1926.html"} -->Stella MAUGERI Blackwell 
    <!--== {/a} ==-->, a Blackwell family researcher, believed Ann was raised
    by brother <!-- {a href="BlackwellJoshua1777ca"} -->Joshua Blackwell 
    <!-- {/a} -->, not Peter.<br>
    <br>
    Sarah and Enoch lived in Lycoming Co., PA, where their two children were
    born: Mary Blackwell in 1806, and Enoch in 1814. Enoch "Sr." died in 1816.
    After Sarah married John Campbell in 1818 and John, Sarah, Mary, and Enoch
    "Jr." lived in Nelson. In 1821 Sarah decided two of John's nephews would
    make good husbands for her daughters. She wrote to Ann Clinch, inviting her
    to come to Nelson to marry Joseph Campbell "Jr." Daughter Mary Blackwell
    married James Campbell. The two sets of siblings married a week apart in
    1822.</big><br>

    HISTORY'S MYSTERIES.<br>

      </li>
      <li>
        <big><big><big>How did Ann feel about Sarah's matchmaking? Was she
        reluctant to leave the well established communities around New Hope,
        Bucks Co., PA, or adjacent Lambertville, Hunterdon Co., NJ, to
        Beecher's Island --- which was still the wild

    <p>
      <big><big><big>Tune in tomorrow ... Oops, we can't do that. Unless
      someone invents a time machine, we'll never know. But over the years I've
      speculated about possible answers.<br>
      <br>
      Everyone can form their own theories and never be proved
      wrong.</big></big></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big><big><big>GIVING UP ANN. Several theories have occurred to me. It's
      not very kind to Enoch Blackwell, but we could suspect that he was
      jealous of the attention Sarah gave to Ann. Or that he was jealous of
      Thomas Clinch, and didn't want Ann around as a reminder. It's more
      charitable, and I think more likely, that it had to do with where Enoch
      and Sarah were going. Enoch, his children by his 1st wife, and some of
      his siblings, came to America as part of The Blackwells, and several
      other families pooled money and sent representatives to Philadelphia a
      year before the main party's arrival. They thought they were getting more
      than 110,000 acres of land in Lycoming Co., PA at bargain prices, on
      which they could farm and support themselves. They apparently bought it
      sight unseen -- as the Campbells and Hazletts also did with Beecher's
      Island. What they got, was hills, covered with virgin forest and a thin
      layer of hardscrabble soil. They built two villages, but the land was
      hard to farm and the communities failed. See:</big></big></big>
      <big><big><big><a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Township,_Lycoming_County,_Pennsylvania">
      The English Settlement</a>. At the time Enoch and Sarah married, few
      cabins would have been built. It may have been that Ann was a sickly
      child and they were concerned that she would not survive such a difficult
      journey. Or that because Lycoming Co.'s Pine Twp. still had wolves and
      cougars and bears (Oh my!) was not a safe place for a young child. But we
      do not know for sure where Peter (or Joshua) were living at that time, so
      none of those hypotheses may fit the facts. Or, it could be that Enoch's
      brother and sister-in-law desperately wanted a child and had grown fond
      of Ann during the sea voyage. We'll never know.<br>
      <br>
      But Enoch may have had the last laugh about the "worthless farm land" of
      the English settlement. The timber that covered it was valuable. Enoch
      became a wealthy lumber man, with extensive property holdings. Every
      spring he would float rafts of logs down Pine Creek to sell them in
      Williamsport --- or continue on down the Susquehanna to Harrisburg. Pine
      Creek may have had the last word, in 1816 he fell into the cold,
      springtime waters of the creek trying to break up a log jam, got
      pneumonia, and died --- probably leaving Sarah a wealthy widow.<br>
      <br>
      WAS THERE CONTACT BETWEEN SARAH AND ANN? There is no evidence of their
      seeing each other or writing --- until Sarah wrote asking Ann to come to
      Beecher's Island and marry Joseph Campbell. But many readers will find it
      comforting that if she wrote once, Sarah and Ann may have written many
      letters over the years.<br></big></big></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big><big><big>WHY MATCHMAKE JOSEPH & ANN? The thinly settled Cowanesque
      Valley of 1822 was a very different world from what we know today.
      Parents had a major role in who their children, especial their daughters,
      married. Economics played a huge role in marriage then. Young men became
      farmers and needed wives to cook, spin, weave, and provide children to
      operate the farm. Single women had few ways of supporting themselves. A
      few could become school teachers and receive room and board with a
      student's family, a small salary that allowed her to cloth herself -- but
      she could afford little beyond necessities. The pool of potential
      marriage partners for young people in Beecher's Island in 1822 was very
      limited. major role in marriage. Young men were to be farmers, and needed
      a wife and children to operate a farm. It's very possible that Mary
      Blackwell and James Campbell fell in love and wanted to marry. Or that
      their parents decided for them.<br>
      <br>
      But in the 1800s, custom dictated that younger sisters shouldn't marry
      before their older sisters.</big></big></big> <big><big><big>Thus Ann
      would have to be "married off" before her half-sister Mary could marry.
      In the New Hope/Lambertville area, Ann may have had competition from lots
      of other eligible girls. And right in front of Sarah was her eligible,
      hard working, God fearing, nephew, Joseph --- who had few eligible women
      to choose from and was 28, well beyond the usual age then for marrying.
      Ann's wedding took place one week before Mary's.<br></big></big></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      <big><big><big>JOSEPH'S AND FOSTER PARENTS FEELINGS. Some have suggested
      that Sarah's arrangement with her brother-in-law Peter (Joshua?) to raise
      Ann may have been made with the clear understanding that Ann would rejoin
      Sarah when grown. If not, and if the Blackwell's loved her as a daughter,
      they may still have anticipated that there was a good chance she would
      move away when she married and they might not ever see her again. Or they
      may have been glad to have one less mouth to feed. We'll never know.<br>
      <br>
      As for Joseph, he made out well and may have been as content as he was
      capable of being. We know from surviving documents that Ann was a capable
      and industrious farm wife. He may not have admitted to valuing such
      worldly factors as comeliness over piety, and we don't know what she
      looked like as a girl. But at middle age she was certainly not
      unattractive. They had 12 children (and James and Mary had 12 or 13),
      which may indicate the matches were satisfactory.</big></big></big>
