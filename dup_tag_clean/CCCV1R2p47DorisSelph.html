          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my <a href=
          "SelphWilliam1871.html">father</a> sent me some Campbell Cousins
          Correspondence paper with the invitation to join this Correspondence
          Circle, it made me feel like a true member of the Campbell Clan.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the last report a most enjoyable
          summer has been passed. For two weeks in July we visited the Cousins
          in Tioga County. At this time I met many of our relatives whose names
          I had only heard before and also met again some whom I could not
          remember.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In September I motored up here and since
          then I have been enjoying to the fullest extent the greatest
          opportunity life has opened up for me. College life with all its
          various phases is certainly wonderful.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Norton is located between Providence and
          Boston, in a very beautiful part of the country, as our Massachusetts
          Cousins know. It is especially lovely just now with all the leaves
          turning, and we take many enjoyable walks through the woods.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one of the smaller Colleges, having
          an enrollment of about four hundred students. The majority of our
          buildings are red brick and I have the good fortune to have my room
          in the newest dormitory. The Library is the very newest building,
          built with Doric columns and the words ‚ÄùThat ye may have life and
          have it abundantly", the Wheaton motto, across the facade.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have just celebrated Founders' Day which
          was very impressive. At this time many alumnae return and after
          exercises in the Chapel, they are entertained at receptions and a
          hockey game is played with them. This year we had the good luck to
          defeat them in this sport.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we are looking forward to the annual
          circus and the Hallowe'en initiation for Freshmen.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings my very best wishes to all the
          Cousins.<br>
          <br>
          <br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very
          sincerely,<br>
