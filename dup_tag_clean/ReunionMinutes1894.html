      Minutes of 1894 Reunion
    </h2>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        The second annual reunion of the Campbell family was held at Nelson,
        Aug. 23, 1894, in the grove of <span wc_id="I688">Mrs. G H
        Baxter</span>, near the Fall Brook depot. The morning was beautiful and
        the fine weather continued throughout the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        The train from the south brought friends from Harrison Valley,
        Westfield, Knoxville, Osceola and Elkland. The train from the north
        arrived about 12 PM, bringing friends from Watkins, Elmira, Wellsboro,
        Mansfield, Tioga, and Lawrenceville, besides the many carriages which
        kept coming all the morning loaded with relatives and friends. Among
        other arrivals was that of the Knoxville band, which furnished
        excellent music for the occasion.
      </p>
      <p>
        If was a very merry party that assembled in the grove to renew their
        friendship and listen to the music and the literary program that had
        been prepared for the entertainment of the company.
      </p>
      <p>
        About 12:30 the secretary announced that the program would begin with a
        selection by the band, composed by one of our absent friends, Mr.
        <span wc_id="I1636">C. B. Campbell</span>, of Green Bay, Wisc. Mr.
        <span wc_id="I685">Ed. Hazlett</span> then gave an address of welcome,
        which was followed by another selection by the band, after which the
        company adjourned to the seats that had been arranged for their comfort
        while partaking of refreshments. After they were seated, the Rev. H.
        Armstrong<sup>1</sup> returned thanks. The dinner consisted of
        everything that would delight the heart of an epicure. When all had
        eaten of the good things until they were satisfied, Mr. <a href=
        "CampbellThomas1856.html">T. C. Campbell</a>, who presided as
        toastmaster, announced the toasts which were responded to as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Our Family" by the President of the society, <a href=
        "CampbellJohn1836.html">John H. Campbell</a>, of Nelson, PA.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Reminiscences," Mrs. <span wc_id="I835">Jessie Ellison</span>, of
        Harrison Valley, Pa.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Our Old Doctor," Dr. A. M. Loop<sup>2</sup>, of Nelson, Pa.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Days Gone By," <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Philip Young</a>, of
        Elmira, N. Y.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Future", by <span wc_id="I686">Mrs. Ed Hazlett</span>, Nelson, Pa.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Generation after Generation," <a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">M. B.
        Seely</a>, Nelson, Pa.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a selection by the band, the literary program began by singing
        "All Hail the Power of Jesus Name," in which all joined in singing. The
        next was an address by <span wc_id="I925">B. <span class=
        "Annotation">[sic]</span> W. Buck</span> of Elmira, N.Y., followed by a
        reading of the minutes of the last meeting, held at Nelson, Aug. 23,
        1893.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Mrs. Jane Tubbs</a> then read the
        memoir<sup>3</sup> of her father and mother, <a href=
        "CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph</a> and <a href=
        "ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann Campbell</a>, giving a history of their early
        home life. In speaking of the religious principles that were instilled
        into their minds she told how in the spring, when they were making
        maple sugar, the sap buckets were always turned over on Saturday night
        as her father thought it would be wrong to use the sap caught on
        Sunday, but her brothers thought it as great a sin to waste the sap, so
        they went back one night and turned them back so as to catch the sap,
        and with the proceeds they bought a log chain, but their father would
        never eat a meal of victuals cooked over a fire made of wood hauled by
        that chain, and when one of the church members<sup>4</sup> introduced a
        violin into the choir he and several others left the
        church<sup>5</sup>. The children went to school at the old log house at
        the mouth of Thorn Bottom Creek<sup>6</sup>. Their clothes were all
        made at home, and the shoemaker went from house to house to make the
        family's shoes, each one having two pairs, one of calfskin for Sunday
        and one of cow hide for every day wear.
      </p>
      <p>
        The secretary then read letters of regret from the following: The
        Campbell Reunion of Mifflin county, Pa., to the Campbell Reunion of
        Tioga county, Pa., which was being held at the same time in Mifflin
        county;<sup>7</sup> <span wc_id="I314">Mr.</span> and <span wc_id=
        "I293">Mrs. Wm. Hazlett</span>, of Chicago, Ill.; Mrs. <span wc_id=
        "I489">Jane Ellison</span>, Merango, McHenry county, Ill; <span wc_id=
        "I65">Sarah J. Campbell</span>, California avenue, Allegheny City, Pa.;
        <span wc_id="I68">John Campbell</span>, Dehaven, Pa.; also a dispatch
        from <a href="CampbellWilliam1864.html">W. C. Campbell</a>, of
        Marinette, Wisc. and a message from over the water from a cousin,
        <span wc_id="I130">Peter Clinch, County <span class=
        "Annotation">[sic]</span> Essex</span>, Gloucestershire, England.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next on the program was a solo by Miss <span wc_id="I1718">Carrie
        Parks</span>, of Nelson, followed by a recitation entitled, "Lottie's
        Message",<sup>8</sup> by <span wc_id="I1895">Rena Campbell</span>, of
        Elkland.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next number, a song, "Old Folks at Home, by Mr. and <span wc_id=
        "I693">Mrs. Will Munroe</span> <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>,
        was omitted on the account of the absence of <span wc_id="I694">Mr.
        Munroe</span> <span class="Annotation">{sic]</span>. Next came a solo
        by Mr. <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil Young</a>, and a recitation
        by <a href="CampbellEleanor1828.html">Eleanor Campbell</a> Bosard,
        entitled, "<a href="http://holyjoe.org/poetry/campbell.htm">Trouble in
        the Amen Corner</a>."
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. <span wc_id="I1577">Ross G. Loop</span>, of Elmira, gave an address
        on "Family Reunions" and Miss <a href="SeelyLena1873.html">Lena
        Seely</a> read an original poem, "The Campbell's." <span class=
        "Annotation">[sic]</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        The following officers were then elected for the coming year:
      </p>
      <p>
        President-<a href="CampbellJoseph1839.html">J. D. Campbell</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Vice President-<span wc_id="I100">E. B. Campbell</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Secretary-<span wc_id="I685">J. E. Hazlett</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Treasurer-<a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">M.B. Seely</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Executive Committee-<span wc_id="I95">Robert Campbell</span>, <a href=
        "CampbellJohn1836.html">John H. Campbell</a> and <span wc_id=
        "I730">Chas. Merritt</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A motion was then made and carried the the balance of the committees be
        appointed by the President.
      </p>
      <p>
        A vote of thanks was given to <span wc_id="I688">Mrs. G. H.
        Baxter</span> and family for the use of their beautiful grounds and for
        their assistance in making the reunion a success.
      </p>
      <p>
        A photographer was present and took a picture of the entire company.
        The family and relatives were requested to come forward to the
        Secretary's desk and register. There were 218 who registered, but a
        large number went away without registering. There were about 300
        relatives present.
      </p>
      <p>
        The balance of the day was spent in exchanging friendly greetings and
        visiting, while the younger ones enjoyed themselves with swings and
        hammocks, at games, etc., all interspersed with frequent selections
        rendered by the Knoxville cornet band.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among some of the interesting data read was a portion of the family
        genealogy, furnished by the Rev. Joel Jewell,<sup>9</sup> now 90 years
        old, but still as spry as many 40 years his junior. He said "Archibald
        Campbell was born in the year 1598 and was one of the leading men of
        Scotland.<sup>10</sup> He signed the Covenant when 40 years of age and
        from that time on became a political leader of the <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenanter">Covenanters</a>, who bound
        themselves to be faithful to the Reformed Presbyterian religion and to
        the King. In 1641 Charles Ist, made him Duke of Argyle, in which he has
        been followed by his heirs for over 200 years. The VIIIth Duke of
        Argyle was George John Douglas Campbell, who was born in 1822 and
        succeeded his father in 1847, at the age of 25 years. His eldest son,
        the Marquis of Lorne, married the Princess Louise in 1871 and in 1878
        was appointed Governor General of Canada. Thomas Campbell of "<a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrude_of_Wyoming">Gertrude of
        Wyoming</a>" in 1869 and "Ye Marriners <span class=
        "Annotation">[sic]</span> of England," and "the Battle of <span class=
        "Annotation">[Mad and Strange Turkish Princes"]</span> also a member of
        this noble family, hence we see and trace back a vein of blue blood
        covering a period of three centuries, and find in the possession of
        some present today mementos handed down from many generations back,
        such as a coat of arms, swords, buckles, amulets, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was to be regretted that a large number of the immediate relatives
        were absent, and we hope to see every living member of the family
        present at the next annual reunion, to be held one year from today, on
        these grounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanking the several committees for their hearty cooperation and
        efficient work in making this, our second annual reunion, a grand
        success, I remain

      </p>
      <p>
        2. Family doctor Albert Mortimer Loop (1818 - 1904) was an amateur
        historian who wrote several chapters of Munsell's <span style=
        "font-style: italic;">1883 History of Tioga county,
        Pennsylvania</span>. His brother, <span wc_id="I1571">George

      <p>
        5. Beecher's Island Presbyterian Church.

      <p>
        6. Just West of Nelson, on the South side of the river. Lands on the
        West bank of the creek was owned by <a href=
        "HazlettSamuel1780.html">Sam Hazlett</a>; the East bank by <a href=
        "CampbellJames1798.html">James Campbell</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. I don't know of any connection between Campbells in Miflin County
        and "our" Campbells.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. A "powerful temperance poem" by Alexander G. Murdoch.
      </p>
      <p>
        9. A friend and admirer of the family. As a boy he'd worked for both
        Joseph Campbell and his brother James.
      </p>
      <p>
        10. In Scotland, the Campbells were divided into several clans, all of
        whom acknowleged the Duke of Argyll as their high chief. Among the
        major branches were: Campbells of Argyll; Breadalbane; Cawdor; and
        Louden. We know the grandchildren of brothers Joseph and James Campbell
        believed they were from the Argyll branch. But we don't know if that
        was just an assumption or if they had evidence for that .
