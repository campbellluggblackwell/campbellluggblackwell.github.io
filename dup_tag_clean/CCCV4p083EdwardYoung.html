        Dear Campbell Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        From the date of this letter I am afraid that some will conclude that I
        was one of those that never did quite arrive when that chorus "The
        Campbells are Coming", was so joyously and triumphantly sung. But
        please do not attribute my habit of procrastination to my being a
        musician as so many are prone to do. Since I really have an excuse I,
        paradoxically enough, hasten to give it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This winter I have been attending New York University and a year from
        now I expect to get a degree at that Institution. Besides carrying a
        full University course I have continued my professional work as
        organist and piano teacher and have tried to do some practicing on the
        side. Next year I hope to get a room down at Washington Square in one
        of the University's dormitories. That will eliminate a daily subway
        ride which those who haven't lived in New York can hardly appreciate.
        New York subways should furnish real estate agents in smaller cities
        wonderful material for advertising.
      </p>

        Last summer I had the pleasure of attending the Campbell reunion at
        Nelson and of meeting many of my Cousins. That dinner we ate under the
        trees in the school yard surely should disprove all the stories one
        hears about Scotch <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> parsimony. It
        did hurt me though to see all those watermelons uneaten. I hope some
        one planted their seeds that we may reap the benefits this year.
      </p>
      <p>
        A week ago I went down to see my brother <span wc_id=
        "I1505">Roswell</span> off as he sailed for Europe on the Leviathan and
        went all through that wonderful ship that Americans may well be proud
        of, even though it was made by Germans. I suppose that when a heavy sea
        comes up that its passengers feel toward it as they would toward any
        ship. I shall know better when my brother returns and tells me how many
        meals he ate while crossing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had the feeling while writing this letter that I haven't had
        much of interest to relate. The life of a busy student isn't the
        romantic life that yields much of interest to write about, which some
        will be surprised to hear. Here's hoping that I will have more to tell
        my Cousins next year. Until then I shall wish them all health and
        prosperity.
