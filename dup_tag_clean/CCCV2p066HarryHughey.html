        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I feel it is a real honor to be enlisted as one of the C. C. A few of
        us, such aw our own family, having been reared out here in the middle
        west never have known much about our dear Cousins of the east, most of
        them having remained in New York State and Pennsylvania, or in other
        words, as <a href="CampbellElizabeth1830.html">gradmother Hughey</a>
        used to call it, the old country.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        You may know that Minnesota has quite a population of Swede
        <span style="font-style: italic;">[sic]</span> and Norwegian people so
        to us children coming from the old country meant that you must be a
        Swede or Norwegian, so we used to joke grandmother as to what
        nationality she held claim to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I must say that since the C. C. C. has been started and we have
        read and re-read the various letters from the different Cousins, it has
        drawn us closer together in our acquaintance, love and admiration of
        the dear relatives who for the most part we have never met. We used to
        look forward to Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charles
        Congdon</a> making us an annual visit about once a year but we have
        passed several of the yearly milestones since his last visit. I used to
        think when Cousin Charles visited us that perhaps he was a superior
        sample of the good looks of the Campbell Cousins, but since the last
        issue of the Cousins letters accompanied by the various photographs, I
        was delighted to see he would have a lot of competing if an album of
        good looks was to be made up. As far back as I can remember, <a href=
        "HugheyHerbert1857.html">Father</a> was looking ahead to making a trip
        back home until at last God closed the door of time, putting an end to
        any future earthly plans for him, and bringing to the rest of us in an
        emphatic way that the cord that holds or connects soul and body is
        frail and uncertain.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is only one thing in this world that we can lay hold upon and be
        certain about and that is the assurance of salvation and eternal life
        through Jesus Christ our Lord. It is heart rending to me to see how
        many are treating this as a minor matter; -- perhaps waiting for a more
        convenient time or waiting, perhaps being guided by the misleading of
        Satan to believe that somehow in the last day God is going to overlook
        sin and through his goodness and mercy usher into his presence all
        those who

      have been regular in Church attendance and have their names recorded upon
      a Church roll,interested in all social reforms and a thousand other
      things as would be recorded in the life's program of a self-righteous
      man. As Paul said in writing to Timothy: "Ever learning and never able to
      come to a knowledge of the truth."

        Cousins, I believe with all my heart that the most important thing is
        to stand by the old Book. First to settle our account with Jesus and
        then build upon him as the rock and foundation of our lives, using His
        book as a blue print to follow. I believe when Nicodemus came to Christ
        inquiring what he must do to be saved and Christ told him that he must
        be born again that He was laying out no different plan for Nicodemus
        than He has for you and me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subject to God's will, I can look forward to nothing that would bring
        greater joy to me than some time in the near future to be able to make
        a Ford trip with <a href="BixbyHannah1863.html">Mother</a> and
        <span wc_id="I1244">Mary</span> and meet all of you dear Cousins. It is
        well to make plans of this kind but when we make them subject to God's
        will then we are not disappointed when God changes them. Should I have
        walked in paths of my own choosing, I would have been in the ministry
        long ago, but so far God seems to have kept all doors closed that would
        open in that direction. I believe for a man to be successful in the
        ministry of Jesus Christ he must be divinely called and lead of God and
        must not get ahead of God in his plans. What God wants is men and women
        thoroughly consecrated to Him. Folks big enough to be small enough to
        do the little thing. If God wants me to milk cows and raise hogs, I am
        willing to do it but if His hand should lead me to carry His Gospel, I
        must say Amen to His Will. But whatsoever we do we must remember that
        if we do it in the name of Jesus that we shall get our reward. Or in
        other words, let our light shine. Jesus said, "Me in Thee and Thou in
        Me." If the world today cannot see Christ in those who are professing
        to be His followers where is the world to look for a testimony as to
        the saving grace of Christ?

        Well, I never intended writing so much or getting so preachy when I
        started this letter, but most folks like to tell all about their
        business when they write to their friends and relatives and the
        greatest business I

        I was glad in looking over the last letters to find that one of the
        Campbell Cousins is in the ministry,-- <span wc_id="I1532">Clifford J.
        Young</span>. I just want to say:-- Stand by the old Book, Clifford,
        which as Paul said is the power of God unto salvation; and you will be
        in the biggest business in the world.

        Well, forgive me for the length of this letter, but I just had so much
        to get off my chest. Space will not permit me to tell anything about
        the large pumpkins, big potatoes and heavy yields of corn we raise out
        here in Minnesota.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to send greetings to all of the Cousins, and to say again that
        if it is God's will I hope to know you all some day in person.
