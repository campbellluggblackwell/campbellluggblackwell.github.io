        Now, we want you all to feel just this way, "Come in! We're glad to
        hear you!" It is a great privilege to be able to welcome this letter
        writing and feel every time we read the letters that we are becoming
        better acquainted.

        It seems strange, as closely united as <a href=
        "CampbellJoseph1793.html">Grandfather Campbell</a>'s immediate family
        was, that the grandchildren should be so scattered. But as it is "the
        people" who make up the world, I am glad that so many of our Clan have
        "scattered", and hope the different parts of the world will the the
        better for it.

        A great many changes have taken place since our last letters. Sickness
        and death have come to many of us. Last July we had a lovely little
        grandson come to us, <span wc_id="I1158">Charles Butler Owlett</span>,
        born to <span wc_id="I1156">Charles</span> and <span wc_id="I1137">Leah
        Owlett</span>. We thought for some time Leah would be taken from us,
        but she was spared and is very well now. The baby is a little (or big)
        fat youngster. I was with <a href="HoytInez1871.html">Cousin Inez</a>
        for a few days when she was sick. Cousin <a href=
        "CampbellMary1851.html">Mary Shipman</a> has been very sick. I was with
        her three weeks in August, staying until <a href=
        "ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel</a> and <span wc_id=
        "I773">Llewellyn</span> came from their western trip. I had been home
        only two weeks when <span wc_id="I1102">Andrew</span> passed away very
        suddenly, breaking our circle for the first time.

        In November I went to Washington, D.C., to visit sister <a href=
        "CraneJennie1852.html">Jennie Bosard</a>, who was in very poor health.
        She improved for a very short time, then failed rapidly and passed away
        February third. She was so patient, good and sweet to everyone. Under
        the circumstances some days were very sad, while others were very
        pleasant; but certainly <a href="BosardFlorence1887.html">Florence</a>
        and <span wc_id="I1050">Mary</span> and her family did everything to
        make it very pleasant for me. I saw and heard many nice things and had
        many delightful auto rides. Washington is a very good place to spend
        the winter. Some snow, icy sidewalks, an eclipse, an earthquake and an
        inauguration all added to the excitement.
      </p>
      <p>
        I stayed in Washington until March seventh, and then <span wc_id=
        "I1050">Mary Snavely</span> and I spend a week in New Jersey with
        Cousins <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> and <a href=
        "BuckGeorge1877.html">George Buck</a>. Will and <span wc_id=
        "I1604">Edith</span> surely did everything to give me a good time. We
        went for rides and to entertainments, and when we came home from our
        sight-seeing trips, we would find good <span wc_id="I13671">Grandma
        Loder</span> with a good dinner ready for us. I was at George Buck's
        for one night and a day, and was made to feel right at home there. I
        wish I might have stayed longer. Every motion George Buck makes is his
        Uncle <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed Congdon</a> right over again.
        Both Will and George have very pleasant homes and very good wives. If
        you would visit them, you would say the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am home now on the farm, and it is time for spring work. The
        <span class="Annotation">[maple]</span> sugar season was short and not
        very good, but any of you who will come to dinner with us may have what
        sugar you will eat. The snow was very deep this winter, but did not
        last long.
      </p>
      <p>
        A number of our cousins have been in Florida the past winter. I suppose
        they are now, or soon will be, like the geese, coming northward.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope we shall hear from everyone of the clan this time. Be the book
        ever so large, we have plenty of room for it alongside other family
        books in the home.
      </p>
      <p>
        As yesterday was my birthday, I went down to <span wc_id=
        "I1128">Jessie</span>'s. <span wc_id="I1109">Ford</span> was home for a
        short time today, and last Sunday five of the children were home. We
        are all usually well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hope we may all be permitted to write a letter again next year.
      </p>
      <p>
        With love and best wishes for all,
