            date we are expected to have our second letter for the "Cousins
            Correspondence" is nearly here and having recently seen so many of
            you, I hardly know what to write.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since our letter of June 15th, Cousin
            <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> and family and
            Cousin <a href="CraneJennie1852.html">Jennie Bosard</a> and family
            made us a short visit which we all enjoyed so much.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Osceola in July ten of the own Cousins
            attended the funeral of Cousin <span wc_id="I1404">Dell
            VanDusen</span>. We so often think of <a href=
            "TubbsAnn1855.html">Cousin Ann</a> but she is not alone in her
            sorrow and we know she is brave as we all try to be.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve of the first Cousins attended the
            Re‑union at Nelson in August and out of the nearly fifty at the
            Cousins' Dinner at <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel</a> and
            Llewellyn's, fourteen of the own first Cousins were there.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are most enjoyable gatherings and we
            regret that each one of you could not have been present.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were much pleased to have with us
            Cousin Lee Congdon’s wife, <span wc_id="I948">Helen Congdon</span>,
            of Tacoma, Wash., who delightfully entertained us with several
            beautiful selections on the piano.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were also glad to welcome others of the
            second Cousins for they will soon have to take our places as each
            year brings many changes.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mabel and family are well; she is at this
            time in Erie, Pa., attending conventions which are being held in
            that city; last week was the State convention of the Woman's
            Christian Temperance Union. Mabel is State Superintendent of
            Scientific Temperance Instruction in Public Schools and Colleges,
            and this week, as delegate, she is attending the State convention
            of the Federation of Women’s Clubs.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span wc_id="I780">Helen</span> is busy
            giving piano lessons which she enjoys much better than teaching in
            the Public Schools as it enables her to be home with her boys while
            in their teens and attending school.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again I want to thank Cousin Will Selph
            for his inspiration and untiring effort in making it possible for
            us not only to hear from so many but also to look in the faces of
            those dear to us by the sacred ties of kinship. We do not know what
            he will ask next,‑ it may be a talk on the radio while the rest
            listen in, but whatever it is, don't let one of us be a
            slacker.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With
            much love and best wishes to all,<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very
            sincerely,<br>
