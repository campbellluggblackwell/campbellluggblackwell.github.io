        To the Campbell Cousins of the First, Second, Third and Fourth
        Generations:
      </p>
      <p>
        Greetings for the year 1925!
      </p>

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Having been informed by two different persons that the annual letter is
        due April first, I shall now attempt to let you know that I am still
        here in Osceola where I was born nearly seventy-four years ago. I live
        but a short distance from the place where I first saw the light of day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not having traveled very much, I may not be as able to interest the
        cousins as those who have traveled from coast to coast. I have enjoyed
        very much reading their fine accounts of their journeys.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many things have happened so far in 1925, to remind us of the
        uncertainty of life. While we were not in the tornado zone, we felt the
        earthquake and have been visited by fire and death in our neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have had a long, cold winter, but are looking for warmer weather
        soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking forward to the Cousins Dinner to be held at <a href=
        "TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie Clark</a>'s (just across our garden), and
        hoping to meet you there, I will now bid you goodbye.
