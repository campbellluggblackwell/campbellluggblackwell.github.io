            Dear Cousins:
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="Message">
          <p>
            As the days roll around and it comes time for another letter for
            the C.C.C., I can't help but draw a long sigh and think to myself,
            "What shall I write about?" When I received Cousin <span wc_id=
            "I1505">Roswell Young</span>'s letter yesterday, giving the fourth
            generation such a send off about being always behind with their
            letters, it made me feel as if I'd like to have a special roundup
            of our generation - and make everyone of them promise from now on
            to be on time with their letters. If any of you happen to be
            listening in on your radio, I hope you'll catch my thought wave,
            "Let's show 'em."
          </p>
          <p>
            I received a letter from Cousin <a href=
            "SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> a short time ago. Was glad
            to hear from him, even though his letter was rather "businessfied".
            I was terribly sorry to learn from his letter that three of the
            cousins had been called away since our last exchange of letters.
            The first thing I did was to get out my correspondence books and
            look up the letters and pictures of those three cousins. How badly
            we all would feel if their pictures and letters were not in the
            books, and how much more necessary it is for us - "slackers" - to
            get busy and see to it that before another exchange of letters
            anyone who hasn't his picture in one of the books should send it
            in, and I'm sure Cousin Will Selph will find a place to paste it
            in. I'm guilty, but I'm going to stand up before somebody's camera
            this next summer, and I'll try to drag along the rest of my family.
            Let's have another book of pictures - what do you say? I'm not the
            only guilty one - so now the rest of you get "shot", too.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got the loveliest box of yellow jonquils and red tulips from
            "Georgiana Gardens", Harper, Washington. They came all
            unexpectedly, and were surely a glad surprise. They came through in
            fine shape, and were scarcely wilted at all. Brother Edd sent them.
            Perhaps some of you already know that my brother, <span wc_id=
            "I1222">Edd Hughey</span>, has gone into partnership with
            <span wc_id="I941">Georgia Congdon</span> Parks<sup>1</sup>, and is
            helping her raise flowers for the market. I hope they won't forget
            to write their C.C.C. letters, and tell us all about their flowers,
            and their families and everything else of interest.

            their childhood days in Brainerd, MN.

            I am wondering if Cousins <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a>
            and <a href="VaughanEmma1854.html">Em Congdon</a> attended the
            Campbell Reunion at Cousin <a href=
            "CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie Congdon</a>'s last fall; also, if
            they spent the winter in California as they said they expected to
            do. I hope everybody will write long newsy letters this time.
            Cousin Charlie visited us Minnesota folks about a year ago. It
            surely seemed good to see him. I couldn't see that he had changed
            in appearance except maybe his hair was a little whiter.
          </p>
          <p>
            In reading and in rereading the C.C.C. letters as I have done in
            the past year, I took special notice to see how many different
            professions are represented among the cousins. Seems as though
            there is one of every kind of profession, but as a whole we are
            mostly all a class of farmers. I can remember lots of things
            <a href="CampbellElizabeth1830.html">Grandma</a> used to tell of
            things that happened when she was a girl. <a href=
            "CampbellJoseph1793.html">Great-grandfather Campbell</a> was a
            farmer, and by what Grandma said, was very strict. Everyone of the
            Campbell sisters had to learn to knit their own stockings, and wash
            and card and spin the flax to be woven into long lengths of linen
            and then colored with shumack<sup>2</sup> or some such juice, and
            then made into their Sunday dresses. Sunday morning found every
            member of the family in church. Sunday morning golf or baseball
            wasn't thought of in those days. Why can't we of today pattern
            after the ways of Grandfather Campbell? Slang wasn't allowed around
            where he was.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grandma related an incident that took place one day when she was a
            girl. They had sweet corn for dinner, and after the meal was over
            her sisters, <a href="CampbellSarah1824.html">Sally</a>, <a href=
            "CampbellJane1834.html">Jane</a>, <a href=
            "CampbellPhebe1832.html">Phoebe</a>, <a href=
            "CampbellEleanor1828.html">Eleanor</a>, <a href=
            "CampbellMaryAnn1826.html">Mary Ann</a>, and the others all piled
            their empty cobs at Grandma's plate, and then some one made the
            remark, "Oh, see all the corn that Lib ate!" Grandma replied, "I
            hope to die, I didn't eat all of that." Then, she said, Grandfather
            marched her out to the woodshed and gave her the worst whipping she
            ever got for saying "I hope to die". Our youngsters of today would
            think it very queer to be punished for such a small offense, but I
            imagine that it looked like a big offense to Grandfather Campbell.
            Perhaps if we could be more like him, there wouldn't be quite as
            much slang used today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cousin <a href="SelphJennie1873.html">Jennie Cady</a> promised to
            relate some stories that Aunt Jane used to tell. Let's hear them
            Jennie! I want to pat <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel
            Shaw</a> on the back for her letter written in rhyme. Well done,
            Cousin Mabel! It surely was good. I see by Cousin <a href=
            "CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie Campbell</a>'s letter that we are
            all invited to spend a winter in St. Petersburg. Do you suppose he
            could take care of all of us in his big hotel? And would he give us
            free board? Let's go - before he pulls in the latch
            string<sup>3</sup>.

            3. Pioneer cabins did not have door nobs or locks. On the inside,
            there was a short bar, permanently fastened at one end, so that it
            could pivot. The other end was free to fall into a slot built to
            hold it securely and prevent someone outside from opening the door.
            In order to get back in when one left the house, a string was tied
            to the pivoting bar, and left hanging outside. To get back in the
            house, you jut lifted the latch string.

            I notice by the different letters from Nelson and Osceola that the
            weather there is about the same as the weather here in Minnesota.
            In referring back to a year ago, different ones speak of seeing
            robins, and making maple sugar and doing their spring
            housecleaning. Well, we are doing the same things here in Minnesota
            today. I saw several robins this morning. My neighbors are talking
            "maple syrup". We took the bees out of the cellar today. They surly
            are having a great old fly. The air seems to be full of them. We
            cleaned a big pan full of fish for dinner. The were caught through
            the ice near the shore. The fish will soon be going up the creeks,
            and then we can get a load of them. They are fine smoked.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ice hasn't gone out of the lakes yet, but in another couple of
            weeks I think it will have disappeared. The frost is going out, and
            cars get stuck in the mud in the low places, but taken as a whole,
            the roads are good. You can even see dust behind the cars 'most any
            place.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was called to the home of one of my neighbors yesterday morning
            before daylight, to help out, but it proved to be nothing very
            serious, or of any consequence, so I won't take the space to tell
            about it, but I must tell you what the doctor said.
          </p>
          <p>
            We were speaking of the cyclones and windstorms in the Southern
            States, and of the fifteen feet of snow in Winnipeg, Canada, and
            the doctor said, "Folks, we are living in God's Country, a streak
            from coast to coast, where we have neither floods, nor tornados
            <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>, nor blizzards<sup>4</sup>,
            nor earthquakes. Everybody is well and happy, with a few
            exceptions. Let's rap on wood." Why go to Florida, and be blown
            away in a tornado? But I would like to go to Harper, Washington,
            and help Edd and Georgia pick flowers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I notice that Cousin George Buck's <span wc_id="I927">wife</span>
            is interested in the Parent-Teacher Association. Well, so am I, and
            I am still busy and interested in our Farmers Club. I am a member
            of the Program Committee, and it means a lot of work, but I feel
            that we are all well repaid for our effort. Our County Agent is
            organizing a "Calf Club" for our youngsters, and our son,
            <span wc_id="I1213">William</span>, twelve years old, is going to
            compete with the other boys and girls in raising a Guernsey heifer
            calf to be taken to the County Fair next fall. William hopes to
            raise the best calf in the lot.

            William is a tenderfoot Boy Scout, but he hopes to pass the test
            soon and be advanced to some higher rank. <span wc_id=
            "I1207">Irma</span>, who is sixteen years old, is a Camp Fire Girl.
            She is working for honors, and earning beads and insignia to put
            upon her Camp Fire gown. The group of Camp Fire Girls to which she
            belongs gave a banquet for their fathers and mothers last Saturday
            night, March twenty-first. It was the thirteenth anniversary of the
            organization of Camp Fire Girls here. They had a three course
            diner, and a huge birthday cake, and then gave a splendid program
            telling all about what it means to be a Camp Fire Girl. The mothers
            and fathers enjoyed the banquet and entertainment immensely. Wish I
            had time and dared to take the space to tell you about it.

            Our last list of letters took up the space of one hundred pages.
            Now, with our membership raised to eighty cousins, how will our
            Secretary be able to record all our letters in one volume? I hope
            all the cousins are well and happy, and that each one will write
            his letter. Do it now, for by another year some of us may not be
            here. I took time off today to write this letter, although my
            conscience tells me I should be ironing and churning and getting my
            work done up, so that I can go to Crosby tomorrow with butter and
            eggs.

            I have seven hen turkeys, and a nice gobbler, Mammoth Bronze, added
            to my flock of poultry. Any one wanting a job at herding turkeys
            this summer, please send in his application.

            If any if the cousins happen to be motoring through Minnesota this
            coming summer, just swing around in the direction of Brainerd and
            Deerwood. We will give you a hearty welcome - have a picnic, and
            all go fishing.
