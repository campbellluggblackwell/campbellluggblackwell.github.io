        Dear Cousins All:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Last Spring when Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a>
        sent us the C.C.C. Book, we were more than pleased; we simply devoured
        every word of it, and our boys <span wc_id="I2376">Enoch</span> and
        <span wc_id="I2427">Preston</span> enjoyed it as much as we.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the sake of the Cousins who do not know just how we are Cousins, I
        will explain: <a href="BlackwellEnoch1814.html">Father Blackwell</a>'s
        own <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">sister</a> was Mother of the
        <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James Campbell</a>l Family and his
        <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">half sister</a> was Mother of the <a href=
        "CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph Campbell</a> Family.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        We have had a long, cold and snowy winter, the first snow coming as
        early as October. <span wc_id="I2369">Charles</span> and I have wished
        many times that we were in the Sunny South, enjoying the sunshine and
        flowers with the <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a> and
        <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">Frank</a>, and the several other
        Cousins and friends who are spending the winter there. However, we are
        anxiously awaiting the warm Springtime.
      </p>
      <p>
        Charlie, <span wc_id="I6065">Ruth</span> and I have been alone this
        winter. Ruth is so much company, also a lot of help to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Preston, our youngest son and <span wc_id="I2428">wife</span>, have
        just purchased <span wc_id="I718">my Father</span>'s home in Nelson,
        and are all moved there. We are delighted to have them so near. I can
        go <u>home</u> now whenever I feel inclined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enoch, our eldest son and family are living at Lawrenceville, Pa. They
        have lovely children whom I am proud to have call me Grandmother.
        <span wc_id="I2380">Enoch Dellivan</span>, the boy, was four the 15th
        of January, 1926, and <span wc_id="I2421">Caroline Mae</span> will be
        one year old the 16th of March, 1926, She is dear, and as some of the
        Cousins already know, is the first girl to be born in our family. The
        last time I went to Lawrenceville to see them Enoch and little Dellivan
        met me at the Railroad Station and Dellivan said, "Grandmother, I'm
        gong home with you and stay 'till we die." Enoch is doing very nicely
        and is planning to build a new home at Lawrenceville this summer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were so shocked over the tragic death of our friend and Cousin
        <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil Young</a>. Our hearts go out in
        sympathy to his bereaved family. We are thinking of the pleasant hours
        spent in the home of our dear Cousins <span wc_id="I1493">Lou</span>
        and Phil.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are anticipating a great treat in reading letters from a hundred
        Cousins this year, and I trust that not one of them will fail to
        respond. Let's all do all we can to help Cousin Will carry on this
        great work. As this is my very first appearance think I have said
        enough.
