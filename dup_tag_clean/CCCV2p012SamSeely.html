        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        The time has now arrived for another exchange of letters and I have
        been twice reminded by <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a>
        to hurry along with mine.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The intervening months have been uneventful but busy ones. I have
        hauled my own milk, done chores and cut wood the rest of the time. Am
        now waiting for good weather to begin farming. The spring of the year
        is the busiest time of all for farmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SeelyJud1851.html">Father</a> comes up real often and helps
        buzz wood<sup>1</sup> and do other small jobs. He seems just as much a
        farmer as ever<sup>2</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our children are all at home with the exception of <span wc_id=
        "I1014">Dora</span> and we are expecting her home <span class=
        "annotation">[from Mansfield Normal School-wbt]</span> Easter Vacation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We greatly enjoyed the last report, especially the photos and are
        anxiously awaiting the next.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        We will always be glad to see any of the Cousins whenever they are in
        Osceola.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do not think of anything more of interest so will close.
      </p>

    <div class="Closing">
      <p>
        Sincerely yours.

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. A buzz saw is a large circular saw. In this case it was probably a
        tractor attachment used by Sam and his father to cut firewood.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Jud had retired from farming and moved into Osceola. According to my
        parents, at the turn of the century, Osceola had such a high percentage
        of retired farmers that kids called it "Feeble Town".
