          Cousins:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my debut in this Correspondence Club,
          representing as I do the second edition, that is, the second
          generation of this illustrious cycle of alleged descendants of the
          Duke of Argyle, styled by our enterprising <a href=
          "SelphWilliam1871.html">secretary</a> the "Campbell Cousins",
          timidity seems to inhibit all news sense, if indeed such an equipment
          ever occupied this upper story. True, the setting for a real effusion
          is superb‑but that is where we seem to stop. Perhaps the brain cells
          need a dish of bran.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I am on the afternoon train between
          Boston and New York, speeding along the Sound. During a short period
          in October of each year I think this is one of the most beautiful
          train trips to be had anywhere in America. True there is no
          particular grandeur of scenery such as may be enjoyed in sections of
          the West, but more gorgeous coloring I have never seen. Old Dame
          Nature operating on the varied New England foliage at this period of
          the year always produces a riot of color that no brush can reproduce,
          and no matter how worldly ones thoughts or ways, he is here reminded
          that the Infinite is always the Master Hand.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have just reached New Haven and are told
          the Giants win the first championship game four to three. Rather
          stale news this will be when it reaches its destination. A discussion
          as to who invented Thanksgiving would perhaps be more opportune at
          that time.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most correspondents in this group in their
          initial appearance seem fittingly to have unburdened themselves of a
          few family statistics. Well my family is large. You think I mean
          large in number but what I really mean is that Anna, my wife, weighs
          one hundred and seventy‑five pounds (although she is trying to reduce
          by eating only what the children and sometimes the dog won't eat in
          addition to her usual three meals a day). In point of number, we are
          a quartet. Donald is now thirteen and Gordon Campbell ten, both in
          Public Schools of Madison, New Jersey, where we have lived for over a
          year. We lived two years in Boston, or in a suburb of Boston,
          Wellesley Hills, having moved there from Chicago in 1920. Now that is
          our family history and it's simple, isn't it?<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our modes of life are equally simple. We eat
          in the kitchen mostly, spend more time with the flowers and other
          things about the place than we do in thought or participation
          in</font></font>

          wash the old bus once a year if we happen to get the time. This
          reference to our mode of life is not an attempt to be facetious but
          rather an effort to illustrate our philosophy that slavish devotion
          to all of the modern conventions does not always appeal to us as the
          most wholesome use of our time.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer we greatly enjoyed <a href=
          "CongdonEmma1848.html">mother</a>'s visit. The snapshot furnished for
          the Cousins' album was taken on Labor Day just before we started to
          take mother to the train to return to her home at Watkins. Uncle
          <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">C.H. Congdon</a> had happened along
          for the week end. Just recently Helen Congdon, <span wc_id="I947">Lee
          Congdon</span>'s wife, paid us a brief but much appreciated visit.
          She gave us first hand news of the Cousins' Dinner. We wanted to
          attend that Cousins' Dinner and really had planned to, but Gordon had
          to play sick the week before and we thought best to give up the
          trip.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this initial appearance in the pages of
          a most well conceived and ably conducted Correspondence Club, may I
          bespeak your considerate indulgence. Forgive if you will the sins of
          omission and by all means forget the atrocities of commission, being
          assured always that your letters which we have carefully read have
          been the source of keen interest, pleasure and satisfaction.<br>
