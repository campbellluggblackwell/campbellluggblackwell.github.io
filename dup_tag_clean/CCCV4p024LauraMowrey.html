        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I will try and write a few lines to the Campbell Cousins; my hands are
        getting rather clumsy-- I cannot write as I used to but maybe you can
        make out a part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has been a long, lonesome winter for us; only just three of us in
        this big house. We had a family living in the front part but they went
        on a visit the first week of January, - then there came a big snow
        storm and they could not get their car through the snow drifts and so
        we have been alone.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1058">Charlie</span>'s health is very poor, hardly able
        to do our few chores, - only two cows, two horses and the fowls to
        feed, but I have been real well this winter. <span wc_id=
        "I1063">Florence</span> goes to school here in our district school, -
        only three girls and seven boys, not like the school we used to go to
        with thirty-five or forty scholars and in the winter such riding down
        hill, Oh! glory, but things have changed about and everything seems
        new, -- I don't see how they do it yet, but still I know they do --
        just a little reminiscence, -- please excuse me but such things come
        into my mind and I cannot resist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today is a beautiful day, bright sunshine all day. St. Patrick's Day in
        the morning but it has been a beautiful day and I have enjoyed it.
        Charlie had to go to town, Florence to school, the dog and I are here
        alone, but I have enjoyed it here on the hills forty miles from
        nowhere, neighbors half a mile away, can't even hear their dog bark or
        their rooster crow but where ignorance is bliss you know it is folly to
        be wise.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope we will all be able to be at the Cousins Dinner this fall as I
        do enjoy them very much.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no special news to write. Everything is very peaceable in this
        neighborhood, -- no fights or quarreling, everybody minds their own
        business and so peace reigns supreme,-- you would think so if you could
        just step in here this forenoon-- the dog is asleep under the couch two
        cats asleep in the rocking chair, the breakfast dishes ready to wash,
        and the broom stands leaning up against the rocking chair waiting very
        patiently to be used, and I must put this nonsense one side and get
        myself in motion or I will hear from headquarters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hope this will be accepted then I will have the courage to write again
        next year if I am spared.
      </p>
      <p>
        With love to all the Cousins of the Campbell Clan, Good bye.
