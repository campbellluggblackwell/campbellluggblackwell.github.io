        Letter from Cousin <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Kate Horton</a>
        read, including greetings from her family with whom she lives in
        Oregon. <span wc_id="I1764">Mrs. Harry Kemp</span> said our program
        would be short giving time for visiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I236">Sara Baumgarten</span> sang Auld Lang Syne. She was
        accompanied by <span wc_id="I780">Helen Ireton</span>. Then the Old
        Kentucky home was very beautifully sung by Sara.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cousin <span wc_id="I773">Llewellyn Shaw</span> made a few remarks. We
        appreciate his being present as he had to miss the Shaw reunion to be
        here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fannie Monroe (not wanting her name on record) gave a wonderful
        address. She reminded us of how our forefathers built about the home
        and the church. She urged us to do likewise, not neglecting the family
        alter [sic]. She believes we should carry our religion into politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remarks by <span wc_id="I1641">Mr. Butler</span> who is just recovering
        from a seriously injured back. Closing with remarks that he feared we
        as American people forget that the home is a divine as well as an
        American institution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cousin Sam Hazlett<sup>1</sup> said that 72 or 73 yrs. ago the first
        reunion was started. It was just a Hazlett Reunion. Later the Campbell
        and Hazeletts [sic] joined.<sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I2564">Leah Evans</span> McCandles who had not been here
        for 32 years expressed her appreciation of being present.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel Shaw</a> said she thought for the
        sake of our ancestors we should keep up these Reunions. She gave this
        poem in closing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "Isn't it queer that princes and kings<br>
        And clowns that caper in sawdust rings,<br>
        And common folks like you & me are builders for eternity<br>
        To each is given a bag of tools, a shapless mass and a book of
        rules<br>
        And each must fashion ere life has flown<br>
        A stumbling block or a stepping stone."
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        A few remarks by <span wc_id="I222">Guy Dewey</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By request <span wc_id="I1649">Mildred Butler</span> told something of
        her work in the mountains of Kentucky.<sup>3</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1892">Rose Jones</span>, <span wc_id="I1745">Sarah
        Kemp</span> Johnson, and <span wc_id="I2564">Rebecca Carpenter</span>
        express their belief we should keep these Reunions up. It would please
        our ancestors could they know.
      </p>

        1. This could have been either <span wc_id="I280">Samuel H.
        Hazlett</span> or <span wc_id="I219">Samuel C. Hazlett</span>. My guess
        would be the latter because both his daughters were active in the
        reunion and were present.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Whichever Sam said that was, at least in part, mistaken or confused.
        He may be correct about the Hazlett Reunion starting in 1873 or '74.
        But he was mistaken about the start of the Campbell Reunions. See
        <a href="ReunionMinutes1893.html">1893 Campbell Reunion minutes</a> and
        <a href="ReunionMinutes1894.html">1894 Campbell Reunion minutes</a>.
        There was a short time when they were called "Campbell-Hazlett"
        Reunions, see <a href="ReunionNewsClip1901.html">1901 News Clip</a>.,
        but by 1903 it was again just <a href="ReunionNewsClip1903.html">"the
        Campbell Reunion"</a>. I have no idea when Hazlett Reunions ended.<br>
        Also, keep in mind that except for a couple of unrelated Hazletts that
        moved to the area later, all of the Hazletts in PA's Tioga Co. & NY's
        Steuben & Chemung Cos. were descendants of either <a href=
        "CampbellSarah1777.html">Sarah (Campbell)</a> Hazlett or of her sister,
        <a href="CampbellJane1792.html">Jane (Campbell)</a> Hazlett and thus of
        their parents, <a href="CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph</a> & <a href=
        "">Mary (Harper)</a> Campbell. All these Hazletts are Campbells as
        well.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. She was in KY as a missionary. Her father was a minister and her
        sister Mary died while a missionary in Nicaragua.
