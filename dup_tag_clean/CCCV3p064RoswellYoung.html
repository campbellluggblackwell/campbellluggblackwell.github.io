        Dear Campbell Cousins:

      <p>
        This spring finds the Young family particularly good health, enjoying
        unusually fine New England weather in a new home. Last November we
        moved to another part of Wellesley Hills where we had bought a house
        and are now experiencing a good deal of amusement watching flowers and
        shrubs, which were planted by some one else, coming through the ground.
        Being unable personally to tell a daffodil from a cauliflower, I shall
        have to wait for the finished article before I shall know what we have.
        The past two weeks have found me using all my spare time picking leaves
        out of the barberry hedge. For every leaf extracted I have acquired a
        painful pricker, and with great relief announce that the hedge is
        almost cleared. One daffodil is already through, the shrubs are all in
        leaf and two flowering quince trees look very promising.

        My older son, <span wc_id="I1509">Phillip Pratt Young</span>, has just
        achieved a pen and the use of ink in school, a very important milestone
        with him. His younger brother, <span wc_id="I1515">John Campbell
        Young</span>, has had his supper in bed the last two nights in the
        expectation that some of his runaway activities might be curtailed.
        <span wc_id="I1506">Katharine</span> adds to her household duties at
        least one afternoon a week bowling in a women's tournament and one or
        two afternoons at bridge. We both bowl in an evening mixed tournament
        and are both pretty punk. Her mother, <span wc_id="I1508">Mrs. Daniel
        T. Pratt</span> of Elmira, has spent most of the winter with us.

        I made my usual trip to Europe this winter, spending some time in
        Paris, Berlin, Chemnitz and London. While in Paris I was disappointed
        to find that <span wc_id="I1478">Harry Campbell</span> and family had
        gone to Nice, where he was studying with the famous singer, Jean
        DeReske<sup>1</sup>, who recently died. Many people have asked me if
        Germany is coming back. My unhesitating answer is that Germany has come
        back. I saw there no signs of unemployment, all mills were running full
        time or overtime, the city shops and department stores were doing a big
        business, the theatres, and particularly grand opera, were patronized
        to their capacity at high prices, and it is said that some American
        movie stars find working in Germany better pay than Hollywood. I
        suppose their greatest want in Germany, and the only thing they really
        suffer from, is the lack of motor cars, largely due to the fact that
        Fords are excluded. Naturally, having no army or navy to pay for, their
        taxes are less than those of either England or France. Very few
        foreigners are travelling <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> in
        Germany, although conditions of

        I look forward to this issue of letters from my Campbell cousins, and
        hope that I may see some of you in Elmira this summer if not before
        then in Wellesley Hills.
