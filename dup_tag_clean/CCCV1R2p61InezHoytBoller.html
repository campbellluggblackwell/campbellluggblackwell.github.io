        As October 15th is near at hand when our letters are due, I am hurrying
        this morning to get mine ready to mail.

        Seeing so many of the Cousins on September 26th at Mansfield
        <span class="Annotation">[PA-wbt]</span> was a great pleasure. The day
        was "A Perfect Day" as far as the weather man was concerned and in
        every other way. <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel</a> and
        <span wc_id="I773">Llewellyn</span> used us in a very Cousinly fashion.
        I know all appreciated and enjoyed their lovely home and hospitality.
        Those who were unable to be there were unfortunate.
      </p>
      <p>
        How nice that Cousins <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed Congdon</a>'s
        family was represented, his son's wife <span wc_id="I948">Helen</span>,
        coming all those miles and reaching Elmira that morning when she was
        met by <a href="CongdonEmma1848.html">Emma Buck</a> and <a href=
        "GoodrichFrances1871.html">Frances Hoyt</a>, Emma having spent the
        night with Frances,- the three of them going on to Mansfield.

        Seems to me we should be getting ready now for our next meeting at
        <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie Congdon</a>'s home in East
        Stroudsburg in 1924. We can all go if only we get busy. My husband,
        William, offered to take our truck and take the whole tribe and could
        easily do so, except he might ask you to chip in on gas; aside from
        that, transportation is free. <span class="Annotation">[In her June 11,
        1923 CCC letter, Inez mentions her husband having a truck made by the
        Reo Company. I've seen pictures of his truck, circa 1920. It appears to
        be the same truck I saw on visits to his farm in the 1940s. It was a
        flat bed with stake sides. He used it for his milk route, picking up
        milk cans at dairy farms near Nelson and taking them to a creamery in
        Elkland. It boggles my mind to think of 10 to 20 "Cousins", who were
        then in their 60s and 70s, riding all day sitting in the back, on the
        floor bed or chairs sliding around --- exposed to sun, wind, and if had
        bad luck, rain. -wbt]</span>

      <p>
        It is so cold here today I am thinking of making a coal fire, although
        the autumn has been very nice and the trees gorgeous in their new fall
        clothes and very beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope to go to Elmira this month as my birthday is October 12th-
        <span wc_id="I1276">Elizabeth</span>'s October 17th and <span wc_id=
        "I1278">Joseph</span>, Elizabeth's little son, is October 31st We met
        there last year on Elizabeth's birthday and had a sort of family
        birthday party and jollification.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1250">Jessie</span> and family were home in August. The
        little folks enjoyed the farm and were very busy all the time; her
        eldest is a kindergarten young man this year, but expects to come next
        summer and help in haying. Elizabeth has not been here for nearly a
        year. <span wc_id="I1285">Isabelle</span> comes a little more
        frequently as she is nearer and can do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am looking forward anxiously for the letters and photos. I fully
        realize the work this makes Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will
        Selph</a> and wish I might help do something.
