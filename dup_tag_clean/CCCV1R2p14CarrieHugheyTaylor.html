            <a href="BixbyHannah1863.html">Mother</a> received the Campbell
            Cousins Correspondence book last June, she brought it up here to
            Deerwood for me to see. The first thing I thought of when I
            commenced reading the letters, was ‑ My How <a href=
            "HugheyHerbert1857.html">Pa</a> would enjoy reading these letters!
            If it had only have been God's will to have left him here with us
            an this earth for just on, more year, I am sure now, at this time,
            he would have been back there in Pennsylvania, shaking hands with
            all you Cousins. But God's way is the best way even though we
            cannot understand. And as Cousin <a href=
            "CampbellMary1851.html">Mary Shipman</a> says in her letter written
            last June, some day in the great beyond there will be a great
            gathering of Campbell Cousins and God grant that we may all answer
            to the roll call. There are several of Pa's Uncles and Aunts and
            Cousins who at different times visited us on the farm. Some of them
            have been called away to their Heavenly home, and some of them are
            still with us and though it may be most impossible for us to see
            each other again upon this earth, it is surely going to be nice to
            read their letters.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoy reading Cousin <a href=
            "CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed Congdon</a>'s letter,‑ have read it
            several times. Wish I could see them all again <span style=
            "font-style: italic;">[<small><span style=
            "font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Carrie knew the Congdons
            from when they lived in Brainerd, MN - wbt</span></small>]</span>.
            I hope <span wc_id="I941">Georgia</span> and <span wc_id=
            "I947">Lee</span> will both send letters and pictures. Please do
            not be disappointed in not receiving an individual picture of my
            family for this report, but just remember that I have not had my
            book yet scarcely a month, and I decided if I tried to rush things
            to have some pictures ready I might not get good ones and I'd
            hesitate to send them, and finally make a failure of it all. Mother
            is sending a family group picture where Pa is with us and I know
            you will all be glad to have a picture where he can be
            included.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear I am making my letter a little too
            lengthy. I can almost hear Cousin <a href=
            "SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a>'s typewriter clicking away
            copying all these letters. He'll be apt to draw many a long breath
            before he gets through. I am going to sit back now and fold my arms
            and wait until November 1st, when all the Cousins' letters will
            come in a big package. I am afraid a great many dishes will go
            unwashed until all those letters are read and I dare say mine will
            not be the only ones. Next April 15th, I promise to continue this
            letter and tell you more about my home. I don't dare take room to
            write any more this time.<br>
            <br>

            Cousins,<br></font></font></font>
