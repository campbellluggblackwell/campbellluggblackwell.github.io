        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>

      <p>
        I feel like a young girl writing his first book which is to be
        published and read through the land.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been kept very busy this year by being a member of the First
        M.E. Church Choir, Basketball Squad I, Girl Scouts, and Victor High
        School Sophomore Class. In Basketball I am Center Guard on the first
        team. We have played eght league games or which we have won five. We
        have three more to play. Our games are usually played every Friday
        night. Not long ago, the 15th of February, the Parent-Teacher
        Association had a special Athletic Program, at which "Dick" Harlow of
        Colgate University and "Eddie" Tryon, All-American-Half-Back, also of
        Colgate, talked to us on "Athletics in the School". Mr. Tryon presented
        to the members of both the boy's and girl's first teams, "Insignia", or
        gold mounted V's, which is quite an honor. We are all quite proud of
        them. By "them" I mean the V's and the team too.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Girl Scouts everyone is busy working on Merit badges. In school
        the Sophomores and Freshmen classes are forever active together. We
        have parties, school socials and special detention classes after
        school. About three night out of five you can usually find two-thirds
        of each class in Detention Hall and it is because we are asking about
        our lessons, for we never talk about Basket Ball and parties in school.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Sunday School Class once a month plans to have a social time and
        one hour of this time we use to study and discuss a book of the Bible
        such as "John or Acts". I enjoy all of this except Detention Class for
        there is usually a senior or two to spoil our fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am very sorry I was not able to be at the Cousins Dinner and see you
        all. I have been quite sick this week and will be glad to get back to
        school and even to Detention Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will now sign off, looking forward to the great number of letters in
        the New Volume.
