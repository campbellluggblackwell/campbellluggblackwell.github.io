        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I did not think that I had much to say so was not going to send a
        letter this time and along came a note from <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a> saying "Don't disappoint us,"
        so I guess it's up to me to sit right down in the midst of my
        housecleaning epidemic, with a paper-hanger upstairs and a painter in
        the kitchen, and write this letter.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        All housekeepers know what confusion I am in, especially in a bungalow
        where all the rooms open up together. But I ought to be clean enough
        when settled so that when the Cousins start out on their vacations,
        they can hit Johnson City at meal time or night and stop with us.
      </p>

        Last November 11th being our anniversary, also <span wc_id=
        "I14492">Mother</span> and <span wc_id="I14491">Father Hill</span>'s,
        we all drove home and spent the Sunday with <a href=
        "LoopStella1863.html">Mamma</a> in Nelson. The men folks helped bank up
        the house<sup>1</sup> and fix the farm for winter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christmas we all ate turkey with <span wc_id="I1595">Treva</span> and
        <span wc_id="I666">Jack</span>. Mamma was able to eat dinner there too
        and we did enjoy it so much.
      </p>
      <p>
        February 15th being Mamma's birthday, we drove home and helped her
        celebrate; but the roads were so bad<sup>2</sup>, we have not tried to
        go home since.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treva and Jack drove up here March 30th for dinner to celebrate
        <span wc_id="I1596">Anne Taylor</span>'s seventh birthday with a pink
        cake and candles.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can remember a few things about our Aunts and Uncles; -- Once when we
        lived in Elmira, <a href="CampbellSarah1824.html">Aunt Sally</a> and
        <a href="CampbellMaryAnn1826.html">Aunt Mary Ann</a> came to visit us
        but could not sleep because of the noise of the trains. We lived miles
        from the railroads too.

    <div class="Footnote">
      1. Many houses, with or without cellars, sat on "dry" stone foundations,
      i.e. no mortar or cement binding them, so the cold wind blew threw them.
      And there usually was no insulation under the floor. So, people piled up
      leaves or straw against the foundations, and usually covered that with
      dirt to hold it in place.&nbsp; - wbt]<br>
      <br>
      2. If the "bad road" problem persisted this late into April, she was
      probably referring to the deep ruts that occurred in dirt roads every
      Spring --- and most roads were unpaved then. It was difficult to drive a
      car on the roads then without getting stuck or risk breaking an axle.<br>

        I can see Aunt Sally baking a pie by the kitchen table while
        <span wc_id="I917">Uncle Ben</span> took a nap on the lounge behind the
        door, with his bandana over his face. Later when he visited us alone,
        he made me a wonderful "fiddle" our of a cigar box. He could play good
        music on it too.

        <a href="CampbellEleanor1828.html">Aunt Eleanor</a> always reminds me
        of beautifully pieced bed quilts. <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">Aunt
        Phebe</a> lived long enough so we all can remember lots of nice things
        she did for us.

        We hope that during the summer we may see some of the Cousins either at
        our home or on some of the trips we anticipate taking.
