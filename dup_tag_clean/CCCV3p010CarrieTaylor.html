        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        As the days roll around and it comes time for another letter for the
        C.C.C., I can't help but draw a long sigh and think to myself, "What
        shall I write about?" When I received Cousin <span wc_id=
        "I1505">Roswell Young</span>'s letter yesterday, giving the fourth
        generation such a send off about being always behind with their
        letters, it made me feel as if I'd like to have a special roundup of
        our generation - and make everyone of them promise from now on to be on
        time with their letters. If any of you happen to be listening in on
        your radio, I hope you'll catch my thought wave, "Let's show 'em."
      </p>
      <p>
        I received a letter from Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will
        Selph</a> a short time ago. Was glad to hear from him, even though his
        letter was rather "businessfied". I was terribly sorry to learn from
        his letter that three of the cousins had been called away since our
        last exchange of letters. The first thing I did was to get out my
        correspondence books and look up the letters and pictures of those
        three cousins. How badly we all would feel if their pictures and
        letters were not in the books, and how much more necessary it is for us
        - "slackers" - to get busy and see to it that before another exchange
        of letters anyone who hasn't his picture in one of the books should
        send it in, and I'm sure Cousin Will Selph will find a place to paste
        it in. I'm guilty, but I'm going to stand up before somebody's camera
        this next summer, and I'll try to drag along the rest of my family.
        Let's have another book of pictures - what do you say? I'm not the only
        guilty one - so now the rest of you get "shot", too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I got the loveliest box of yellow jonquils and red tulips from
        "Georgiana Gardens", Harper, Washington. They came all unexpectedly,
        and were surely a glad surprise. They came through in fine shape, and
        were scarcely wilted at all. Brother Edd sent them. Perhaps some of you
        already know that my brother, <span wc_id="I1222">Edd Hughey</span>,
        has gone into partnership with <span wc_id="I941">Georgia
        Congdon</span> Parks<sup>1</sup>, and is helping her raise flowers for
        the market. I hope they won't forget to write their C.C.C. letters, and
        tell us all about their flowers, and their families and everything else
        of interest.

        I am wondering if Cousins <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a> and
        <a href="VaughanEmma1854.html">Em Congdon</a> attended the Campbell
        Reunion at Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie
        Congdon</a>'s last fall; also, if they spent the winter in California
        as they said they expected to do. I hope everybody will write long
        newsy letters this time. Cousin Charlie visited us Minnesota folks
        about a year ago. It surely seemed good to see him. I couldn't see that
        he had changed in appearance except maybe his hair was a little whiter.
      </p>
      <p>
        In reading and in rereading the C.C.C. letters as I have done in the
        past year, I took special notice to see how many different professions
        are represented among the cousins. Seems as though there is one of
        every kind of profession, but as a whole we are mostly all a class of
        farmers. I can remember lots of things <a href=
        "CampbellElizabeth1830.html">Grandma</a> used to tell of things that
        happened when she was a girl. <a href=
        "CampbellJoseph1793.html">Great-grandfather Campbell</a> was a farmer,
        and by what Grandma said, was very strict. Everyone of the Campbell
        sisters had to learn to knit their own stockings, and wash and card and
        spin the flax to be woven into long lengths of linen and then colored
        with shumack<sup>2</sup> or some such juice, and then made into their
        Sunday dresses. Sunday morning found every member of the family in
        church. Sunday morning golf or baseball wasn't thought of in those
        days. Why can't we of today pattern after the ways of Grandfather
        Campbell? Slang wasn't allowed around where he was.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grandma related an incident that took place one day when she was a
        girl. They had sweet corn for dinner, and after the meal was over her
        sisters, <a href="CampbellSarah1824.html">Sally</a>, <a href=
        "CampbellJane1834.html">Jane</a>, <a href=
        "CampbellPhebe1832.html">Phoebe</a>, <a href=
        "CampbellEleanor1828.html">Eleanor</a>, <a href=
        "CampbellMaryAnn1826.html">Mary Ann</a>, and the others all piled their
        empty cobs at Grandma's plate, and then some one made the remark, "Oh,
        see all the corn that Lib ate!" Grandma replied, "I hope to die, I
        didn't eat all of that." Then, she said, Grandfather marched her out to
        the woodshed and gave her the worst whipping she ever got for saying "I
        hope to die". Our youngsters of today would think it very queer to be
        punished for such a small offense, but I imagine that it looked like a
        big offense to Grandfather Campbell. Perhaps if we could be more like
        him, there wouldn't be quite as much slang used today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cousin <a href="SelphJennie1873.html">Jennie Cady</a> promised to
        relate some stories that Aunt Jane used to tell. Let's hear them
        Jennie! I want to pat <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel Shaw</a> on
        the back for her letter written in rhyme. Well done, Cousin Mabel! It
        surely was good. I see by Cousin <a href=
        "CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie Campbell</a>'s letter that we are all
        invited to spend a winter in St. Petersburg. Do you suppose he could
        take care of all of us in his big hotel? And would he give us free
        board? Let's go - before he pulls in the latch string<sup>3</sup>.

        3. Pioneer cabins did not have door nobs or locks. On the inside, there
        was a short bar, permanently fastened at one end, so that it could
        pivot. The other end was free to fall into a slot built to hold it
        securely and prevent someone outside from opening the door. In order to
        get back in when one left the house, a string was tied to the pivoting
        bar, and left hanging outside. To get back in the house, you jut lifted
        the latch string.

        I notice by the different letters from Nelson and Osceola that the
        weather there is about the same as the weather here in Minnesota. In
        referring back to a year ago, different ones speak of seeing robins,
        and making maple sugar and doing their spring housecleaning. Well, we
        are doing the same things here in Minnesota today. I saw several robins
        this morning. My neighbors are talking "maple syrup". We took the bees
        out of the cellar today. They surly are having a great old fly. The air
        seems to be full of them. We cleaned a big pan full of fish for dinner.
        The were caught through the ice near the shore. The fish will soon be
        going up the creeks, and then we can get a load of them. They are fine
        smoked.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ice hasn't gone out of the lakes yet, but in another couple of
        weeks I think it will have disappeared. The frost is going out, and
        cars get stuck in the mud in the low places, but taken as a whole, the
        roads are good. You can even see dust behind the cars 'most any place.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was called to the home of one of my neighbors yesterday morning
        before daylight, to help out, but it proved to be nothing very serious,
        or of any consequence, so I won't take the space to tell about it, but
        I must tell you what the doctor said.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were speaking of the cyclones and windstorms in the Southern States,
        and of the fifteen feet of snow in Winnipeg, Canada, and the doctor
        said, "Folks, we are living in God's Country, a streak from coast to
        coast, where we have neither floods, nor tornados <span class=
        "Annotation">[sic]</span>, nor blizzards<sup>4</sup>, nor earthquakes.
        Everybody is well and happy, with a few exceptions. Let's rap on wood."
        Why go to Florida, and be blown away in a tornado? But I would like to
        go to Harper, Washington, and help Edd and Georgia pick flowers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I notice that Cousin George Buck's <span wc_id="I927">wife</span> is
        interested in the Parent-Teacher Association. Well, so am I, and I am
        still busy and interested in our Farmers Club. I am a member of the
        Program Committee, and it means a lot of work, but I feel that we are
        all well repaid for our effort. Our County Agent is organizing a "Calf
        Club" for our youngsters, and our son, <span wc_id=
        "I1213">William</span>, twelve years old, is going to compete with the
        other boys and girls in raising a Guernsey heifer calf to be taken to
        the County Fair next fall. William hopes to raise the best calf in the
        lot.

        William is a tenderfoot Boy Scout, but he hopes to pass the test soon
        and be advanced to some higher rank. <span wc_id="I1207">Irma</span>,
        who is sixteen years old, is a Camp Fire Girl. She is working for
        honors, and earning beads and insignia to put upon her Camp Fire gown.
        The group of Camp Fire Girls to which she belongs gave a banquet for
        their fathers and mothers last Saturday night, March twenty-first. It
        was the thirteenth anniversary of the organization of Camp Fire Girls
        here. They had a three course diner, and a huge birthday cake, and then
        gave a splendid program telling all about what it means to be a Camp
        Fire Girl. The mothers and fathers enjoyed the banquet and
        entertainment immensely. Wish I had time and dared to take the space to
        tell you about it.

        Our last list of letters took up the space of one hundred pages. Now,
        with our membership raised to eighty cousins, how will our Secretary be
        able to record all our letters in one volume? I hope all the cousins
        are well and happy, and that each one will write his letter. Do it now,
        for by another year some of us may not be here. I took time off today
        to write this letter, although my conscience tells me I should be
        ironing and churning and getting my work done up, so that I can go to
        Crosby tomorrow with butter and eggs.

        I have seven hen turkeys, and a nice gobbler, Mammoth Bronze, added to
        my flock of poultry. Any one wanting a job at herding turkeys this
        summer, please send in his application.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any if the cousins happen to be motoring through Minnesota this
        coming summer, just swing around in the direction of Brainerd and
        Deerwood. We will give you a hearty welcome - have a picnic, and all go
        fishing.
