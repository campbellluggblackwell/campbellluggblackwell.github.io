            Selph</a>, and all other Campbell Cousins, a hearty greeting from
            this southern extremity of the good old U. S. A. "Cousin Will", you
            will note that one of the Clan has already taken advantage of the
            suggestion in clause One, of your letter of May 29th, that some
            member of the family write something for the quarterly folio, if
            the real Cousin is unable to do so. So it gives me great pleasure
            to have the privilege of writing this first letter, although I am
            sure <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a> could write a
            much more interesting one. He is building houses, selling lots,
            etc. and is more than busy this week, and he has asked me to write
            this letter. He is still working for the filthy lucre and hopes to
            have enough dough to keep the wolf from the door when old age comes
            creeping on.<br></font></font></font></font>

            located for life at the above address. We came south to escape the
            extreme cold winter weather of the north, and incidentally to see
            if it would not iron out a little neuritis and rheumatism, both of
            which it has most gloriously accomplished, bringing to each of us
            renewed health and vigor and with it the ambition to be doing
            something. We had spent four winters in various parts of Florida
            prior to 1918, and had fully come to the conclusion that the
            climate here was so much better for our health, and fully believing
            it would lengthen our days, we sold our home and business interests
            in good old Pennsylvania and started South by auto in December,
            1918. We were thirty days enroute (though could have made it in ten
            days easily) and in many ways it was the most wonderful and
            enjoyable trip we ever took,‑ all of which I would like to describe
            to you, but space will not permit. Here we bought a property, and
            erected a small Hotel on it, with a capacity of sixty guests, and
            it has been filled each year since, all through the tourist season.
            Two years ago we rented out the Dining Room, and last year we let
            the whole house, reserving an apartment for ourselves,‑ but
            preferring quiet, vacated our apartment and took a nicely furnished
            home out in the suburbs where we enjoyed a quiet winter. Then

              our sons‑in‑‑law lost their Mothers during the past month: Mrs.
              Mitchell (the Mother of Ruth’s husband) was struck by a street
              car while crossing the street in Rochester and lived less than a
              day, never gaining consciousness.

               (the Mother of Mary’s husband) fell down stairs, and died from
              the effects of the fall. It seems as though both our daughter’s
              families were so saddened at the same time, our regret being that
              we were not near them to help lighten their burdens and give
              sympathy in their sorrow. But such is life everywhere: Some weep
              while others sing, and it would be a sad old world if we were all

              all the pleasures of life, and I believe are twenty‑five years
