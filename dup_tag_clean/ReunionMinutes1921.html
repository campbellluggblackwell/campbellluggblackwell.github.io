    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. All the records I have seen state 1893 was the first. Such as
        <a href="ReunionMinutes1893.html">1893 minutes</a>, <a href=
        "ReunionMinutes1894.html">1894 minutes</a>, and <a href=
        "ReunionProgram1894.html">1894 invitation</a>. I don't know why Laura
        BOSARD Mourey became convinced the first Campbell Reunion was in
        1892&nbsp; -wbt.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Because they started in 1893, this was the 29th.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Emma was confused. Mabel did have an Uncle Joseph D. Campbell. But
        Nina's father was Joseph G. Campbell, Mabel's 1st cousin twice removed
