        Your kind Invitation&nbsp; received ever so much pleased to be
        remembered&nbsp; would like much to be present at Campbell Reunion, but
        my health is not very good and would not like to undertake the
        trip&nbsp; there is only 3 of our family living&nbsp; that is sisters
        <span wc_id="I65">sally</span> and <span wc_id="I71">Elizabeth</span>
        of Alegheny <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> City and my
        self&nbsp; I have quit farming&nbsp; I bought a property built and
        moved here last spring. I like this place very well it is a village on
        the Pittsburgh and western RR about 3 miles from my farm which I rented
      </p>
      <p>
        I will send the invitation to brother <span wc_id="I63">Samuels</span>
        <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> family and if I know of any of
        the relations that are going I will write and let you know&nbsp; I hope
        you will have a real pleasant time as I think your <a href=
        "ReunionProgram1894.html">program</a> is excellant; perhaps I might
        feel able to go some other time as I see that reunion is to be
        annually&nbsp; so come to see us when ever you can as we'll be glad to
        see you
      </p>
      <p>

        1. In the upper left corner of the stationary there is an embossed
        image of a building -- unidentified so far. John was born on a farm
        that was then "near Pittsburgh," but apparently later became part of
        Pittsburgh's North Side. The farm he retired from was in McCandless
        Twp., Allegheny Co., PA. His new home, at Dehaven Station, on Murray
        Ave., is in present Allison Park, Hampton Twp., Allegheny Co. I have
        visited his grave in nearby Hampton Cem.-wbt
