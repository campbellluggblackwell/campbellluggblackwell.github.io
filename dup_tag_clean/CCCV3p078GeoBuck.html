        Dear Cousins:

        It is said of some people if they do a thing once it is for them an
        experience, and if they do it twice it becomes a habit. My initial
        contribution to the C. C. C. was written on a train between Boston and
        New York. The last letter was written somewhere on a train. Here I am
        today back again in place Number One, on the train an hour out of
        Boston and headed for New York; and so it is not only the doing that
        seems to have become a habit with me, but the "how" and "where" as
        well.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Boston I called on Cousin <span wc_id="I1505">Roswell Young</span>.
        We lived in the same town for about a year and never knew it, so with
        its many attractions the C. C. C. can also claim something for its
        identification system.

        Mr. Lord succeeded the late <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cabot_Lodge">Henry Cabot Lodge</a>
        as president of the Massachusetts Historical Society. He was also
        president of the Pilgrims Society of Plymouth, and he was regarded as
        the greatest living authority on early New England and Pilgrim history.
      </p>

        A beautiful memorial window in the chancel of the First Pilgrims Church
        of Plymouth is a representation of the signing of the Pilgrim compact
        on the Mayflower. As the sun filtered through the stained glass the
        picture was clear and impressive. And then, almost within a stone's
        throw down at the water's edge, lies Plymouth Rock. Between the two
        spots, and not more than two hundred feet from the Rock, is the home in
        which lived the man for whom rites were being said in the little church
        I have mentioned. The home, a frame structure, roomy and hospitable,
        has seen nearly three centuries. It has been occupied by five
        successive generations of the same family. Over the mantle in the den
        is a cane from India, the possession of eight successive generations.
        One room contains what is said to be the most complete library on
        Pilgrim history. Looking out from the den one sees the beautiful garden
        with its sun dial and other relics, as well as many rare shrubs that
        have been brought from Plymouth, England.

        I refer at length to a "setting" because never have I seen that which
        represents so much in space of time in historical significance and
        influence upon national traits brought together in such simplicity and
        yet so much grandeur. True, the particular occasion was to pay respect
        to the memory of a man. But the man, his life, his contribution to
        society and what he, by his example, bequeathed to sturdy New England
        character, were all symbolizing at the moment the finest traditions of
        the Pilgrims, and it was right at the spot where they landed and in the
        very atmosphere in which their first trials in a new land were lived.
        It was a sad occasion, but an inspiring reminder of what a man may do
        and be, and how he can shape his career by attuning it to the
        traditions of the past and at the same time vitalize it and make it
        meaningful to others.

        <span wc_id="I1551">Joe Buck</span> has <a href=
        "CCCV3p072JosWBuck.html">given us</a> a most interesting picture of the
        Campbell landing on our shores<sup>1</sup>. A farm still owned in his
        family has been in continuous possession of Campbells since
        approximately the time of their landing<sup>2</sup>. All this is
        becoming background for a fine tradition, The Pilgrims had a couple of
        centuries start of us, but in two hundred years from now what will be
        said of us? What will our traditions be? Will they have become
        commonplace or will they have attained individuality and distinction?
        Who will be the successive "guardian angels" of these traditions? Joe's
        suggestion of gathering up the loose ends and building upon the present
        foundation is worthy of most serious consideration. <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a>'s contribution thus
        far<sup>3</sup> is most significant, and he has the spirit to do more,
        We must not regard ourselves, like the American Indians, as a fast
        vanishing race, but starting from where we are, why not make use of
        combined talent in assembling, nurturing and building up traditions
        that will not be showy, but glorious. They will not be the Pilgrim
        traditions, but they would be Campbell traditions<sup>4</sup>.
      </p>

        <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel Shaw</a> has written a very
        <a href="CCCV3p052MabelShaw.html">interesting account</a> of their trip
        last summer. She refers to stopping over-night at Buhl, Idaho. A number
        of years ago I had an interest in some land at Clear Lake, a few miles
        from Buhl, and Buhl was our principal trading point. If Mabel and
        <span wc_id="I773">Llewellyn</span> had taken the trip back in the
        earlier years of their married life, we might have chanced to meet in
        Buhl, and wouldn't we have said, "What a small world this is!"
      </p>

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. The 1810 landing of the elder Joseph Campbell and his younger
        children was the last of at least three landings. His older children
        had come at least 7 years earlier. His brother John may have come as
        early as 1776.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Presumably this was the farm of Joe's grandfather, the 1839 Joseph
        Campbell, which in turn was part of the original land purchased by his
        grandfather, the 1748 Joseph Campbell.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Among Will's contributions as of that date were starting the
        Campbell Cousins Correspondence Club and having the family "genealogy
        chart" prepared and distributed to all his 1st cousins.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. It may be too late. "Campbell traditions" may have become
        inextricably mixed up with Tubbs traditions, Owlett traditions, Van
        Dusen traditions, etc. etc. Who that's still alive can reliably
        separate which traditions belong to which ancestral line?

        Once when I was taking a rather late train at Gooding, Idaho, and
        possessed of a feeling that I was mighty far away from most anybody I
        knew, I met Perry Creager, a nephew of Aunt <span wc_id="I961">Anna
        Congdon</span>. We traveled together to Portland, remarking frequently,
        "This world is indeed small"!
      </p>
      <p>
        I see I am using up space without saying much about my family. The
        reasons for this are, <span wc_id="I927">Anna</span> has promised to
        write a letter, and since she runs the family she is the logical one to
        write about it; and some of the cousins in their letters have been kind
        enough to make such references as will help identify us--at least tell
        where we live and, I hope, convey the impression that we try to have a
        cordial welcome waiting for any cousin that happens our way. If, by
        chance, any brave one right out of the clear and without any other
        provocation would just pack his grip to come visit us, we'd think him a
        darned good sport, and would treat him "right" as well as "ruf".

        Since the job of "official bookmaker" has been temporarily wished on
        me, I shall take the liberty of making any "professional" explanation
        or business comments under a separate heading and at a time when I may
        have a better idea as to what I "look like" when I am nearer the end of
        the job than on this Day of Grace "yet".
