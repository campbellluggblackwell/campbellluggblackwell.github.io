        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I suppose the thing to do, in my first letter, is to say a word about
        myself. The tale is briefly told: I am now a Presbyterian clergyman,
        pastor of a church at Rockville Centre, Long Island, a suburb of New
        York City. And I like it!
      </p>
      <p>
        As many of you know, I had a rare privilege summer before last,-
        between my second and last years in Theological Seminary, of returning
        to Nelson and refreshing boyhood memories of vacations spent at
        <span wc_id="I1473">Grandma</span>'s. For three months I came over each
        Sunday afternoon from Tioga, where I was also pastor, to preach the
        gospel in the old church at Nelson in which my grandfather, <a href=
        "CampbellJohn1836.html">John H.</a>, served for so many years as
        elder,- the church in which many of you received your early religious
        training,- in which you were christened and possibly married. Altho
        twelve years had elapsed since I had visited Nelson for any length of
        time, the scenery soon came to be familiar again, and there were many
        faces in my congregations that I recognized on sight. It did my heart
        good to stand up there in that pulpit Sunday after Sunday and talk to
        those people. Nelson and the Campbells now have an even greater place
        in my affections than ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
        To all the Campbells whom I haven't seen in years, if ever, and
        especially to those of you whose acquaintance I have ao recently
        renewed,- I send most cordial greetings.
      </p>
