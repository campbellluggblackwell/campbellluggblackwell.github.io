        Dear Cousins All:
      </p>

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        The time has again come to write a letter to the Cousins. It seemed
        quite a task, but after getting started I enjoy writing. I also
        anticipate great pleasure in reading the letters from the various
        Cousins.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        My family is well at present.
      </p>

        The first of April brought a deep snow here, but it quickly disappeared
        and now seems quite spring like again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maple sugar making has been quite short this year. We tapped a a few
        trees and have made enough for our own use.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have just had a lovely rain which we appreciated very much, as the
        wells in this neighborhood, were rather low.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><em></em>Well, I do not know what to write to interest the
        others so will close. I am anxious to get the next report.
      </p>
      <p>
        With love to all,<br>
      </p>
