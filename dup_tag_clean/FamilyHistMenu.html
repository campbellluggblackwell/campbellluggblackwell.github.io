          is for the descendants of one pioneer couple,</a> <a href=

          families --- especially HAZLETTs, LUGGs and BLACKWELLs. They now have
          10 generations of descendants. Our family tree now contains over
          24,000 individuals, with more than 4,500 surnames. Since the very
          beginning, our Campbells, Hazletts, Luggs and Blackwells have been

          Enjoy exploring these pages, and be sure to contact us if you are a
          relative. We love hearing from "new" cousins we hadn't known of.

          [Cautionary note: Several different, unrelated, Campbell families
          came to Tioga Co., PA in the early 1800s. It's easy to get the
          various families mixed up. A few of us have ancestors in more than
          one of those Campbell lines.]

        <h3>
          Our Story
        </h3>
        <p class="FirstP">
          Our story starts with Joseph Campbell (born 1748 in Scotland) and
          wife Mary Harper (born 1749 in Scotland) who lived for a while in
          County Antrim in North Ireland, the men reportedly worked at the
          Belfast Iron Works before coming to the US.
        </p>
        <p>
          They pronounced their name as "CAM-uhl" (like the cigarettes), not as
          "CAMP-bell" or "CAM-bul". (When the surname was created, almost 800
          years ago, it was spelled 'Cambell.')
        </p>
        <p>
          The first member of the family known to come to America was Joseph's
          younger brother <a href="CampbellJohn1761.html">John Campbell</a>, b.
          1761 in Scotland. He came about 1776 to Philadelphia, where he was
          first a tailor, and later a land agent.-
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of our Campbells, the Hazletts, the Luggs, and the
          Blackwells immigrated in dribs and drabs over the years --- the
          last&nbsp; (Chas. B. Lugg & family) in 1833.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a timeline and details, see <a href="WhoCameWhen.html">Who Came
          When</a> (it covers Campbells, Hazletts, Luggs and Blackwells).
        </p>
        <p>
          By the very early 1800s, some of Joseph and Mary's older children had
          settled in Lancaster Co., PA. Their oldest son, <a href=
          "CampbellJohn1781.html">John Campbell</a> (b. 1781) soon moved to the
          Pittsburgh area. Eldest daughter <a href=
          "CampbellSarah1777.html">Sally</a> and son-in-law, <a href=
          "HazlettSamuel1780.html">Sam Hazlett</a> , by 1806 may have moved
          from Lancaster Co. to a farm near Stroudsburg, PA. By 1810 Sam
          Hazlett, Joseph Campbell and the elder John Campbell completed land
          purchases in <a href="BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's Island</a>.
          Joseph and Mary Harper Campbell, plus their younger children, came to
          the US in the fall of 1810.
        </p>
        <p>
          Probably in late 1810, Joseph and Mary, accompanied by 5 of their 8
          children; 2 of their 3 Hazlett sons-in-law; Joseph's brother John;
          and their livestock migrated from son-in-law Sam Hazlett's farm in
          PA's Monroe Co. (or perhaps Lancaster Co.) to Beecher's Island.
          Stories about their epic journey were recorded by
          granddaughter-in-law <span wc_id="I661">Lucy DUNHAM</span> Hazlett.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Campbells and Hazletts were among the first permanent settlers in
          the area. They rapidly multiplied. <a href=
          "CampbellJames1798.html">James</a> and <a href=
          "BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary Blackwell</a> Campbell apparently had
          13. <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph</a> and <a href=
          "ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann Clinch</a> Campbell had 12 children.
          <a href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John</a> and <a href=
          "CampbellJane1792.html">Jane Campbell Hazlett</a> had 9. Sam and
          Sally Campbell Hazlett had 7. So they quickly populated a community
          and filled a school house.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1894, <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">Phebe CAMPBELL</a> Hoyt
          organized the first Campbell Reunion (they liked to spell it
          "Re-union'). The reunions were held annually for 50 years. At their
          peak, more than 300 attended, including many Blackwells and Luggs.
          They were halted in WW2, but restarted in 2000 by Phebe's
          great-grandson, Bill Thompson. One branch of the family (Joseph and
          Ann Clinch Campbell's line) found the reunions too big, and held
          separate Campbell Cousins Dinners, which were by invitation only, and
          primarily for the 21 first cousins who were Joseph and Ann's
          grandchildren. They had grown up together, and felt a strong bond to
          each other. Both events were held yearly, almost always near Nelson.
          Many of the Cousins Dinner attendees were also active in the
          "Re-unions".

          Your additions and corrections to our letters, photos, stories or
          updates to our tree are most welcome. And please come to our
          reunions. They're held in Nelson, PA in even numbered years. The
          <a href="ReunionNext.html">next one</a> will be Aug 1, 2020. Because
          of COVID-19 it will be our first reunion that you can join in from
          your homes via Internet or land lines, thanks to videoconferencing
          via Zoom.com. It will be a chance to meet cousins from all over the
          country for the first time and a chance to connect to your "roots".
