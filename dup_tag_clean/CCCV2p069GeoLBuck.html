        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        After all how quickly six months roll around. When I last wrote a
        Cousin's letter I was on a train traveling along Long Island Sound and
        now in taking a little trip among the Berkshire Mountains, I find
        myself again addressing my thoughts to the kin.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        While riding up from New York on the train but before beginning this
        letter, I spent some time in a belated reading of "The Americanization
        of Edward Bok." Almost everyone knows Edward Bok as the editor of the
        Ladies' Home Journal. Just why I should mention the reading of a book
        in this letter is perhaps not quite evident. It just happened to be on
        my mind. The writer of the book is certainly and egotist but
        nevertheless there is the thought that this is one of the books that is
        well worth while for those who would seek inspiration from the lives of
        those who have overcome obstacles.
      </p>
      <p>
        We think we as a family are very much Americanized and yet it was but a
        few short generations ago that our forefathers landed in this country.
        The path we travel in life is after all largely the path of our own
        making and so in a way the general direction of a group descending from
        the same forefathers is the result of their average thinking and
        acting. Somewhere back along the line as represented in our
        forefathers, each one of us is a foreigner landed in this country with
        the problems of conquest all ahead. Our group today quite largely
        represents what our Campbell forefathers stood for and through
        inheritance and environment encouraged us to stand for. Perhaps these
        letters among ourselves may for one purpose serve as a sort of a study
        into our own achievements, as a sort of a checkup on ourselves, and
        perhaps we each from the entire group may gain some little idea or
        ideas that will be helpful to us individually in attaining the maximum
        standard with which in the end the descendants of <a href=
        "CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph Campbell</a> may be accredited.
      </p>
      <p>
        In writing letters there is perhaps always the tendency to be either
        very personal or very preachy. It is a rare genius that knows where to
        draw the line on either of these inclinations. The contact among many
        of the Cousins is so close that the personal narrative assumes double
        interest, but in the case of some of us who have been some-

      what isolated from the group at large, the little personal incidents of
      our lives may be of less interest to others.

        "Mein frau," <span wc_id="I927">Anna</span>, tells me I am too
        abstemious in relating personal incidents. I suppose she would have me
        tell you, if this were the fact, that the little old cat has a litter
        of little kittens, etc., but I doubt that would after all interest you.
        We have enjoyed good health. The boys, <span wc_id="I928">Donald</span>
        and <span wc_id="I929">Gordon</span>, are in school. Then Anna has not
        been washing dishes at the kitchen sink and performing other similar
        house duties, she has spent some time in efforts which she thought
        would be interesting to the community at large. Her principal activity
        has been a Parent-Teacher Association, for the organizing of which she
        has been quite largely responsible in our home town. She feels little
        time devoted to work of this kind may be a little contribution to
        others while the effort in itself is worth more for the person who
        makes it. It is claimed that the women of the State of New Jersey are
        more highly organized politically than the women of any other State.
        Anna finds it of great interest to participate in the activities of
        these organization and in meeting the keen minds which one naturally
        comes in contact in such work, there is certain amount of education and
        inspiration.

      <p>
        At home we have been somewhat upset and somewhat confined owing to
        repairs on an old house which we purchased a year ago. It has been a
        lot of fun and a lot of work. It has sometimes been said the home is
        the open book of the individual, and surely it is somewhat worth while
        to make the home reflect ourselves and our taste. With us this done in
        a most modest way and we do not know how better to suggest a closer
        acquaintance with out Cousins than to suggest that as opportunity
        presents itself they drop in at Madison and thus read our book.

        With cordial regards to all,
