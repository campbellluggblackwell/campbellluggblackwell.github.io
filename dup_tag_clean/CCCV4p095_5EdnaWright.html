        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I am rather late with my letter but have been ill and unable to write
        as I hoped. I have had La Grippe<sup>1</sup> and also ear trouble but
        am very much better now and with my three boys and <span wc_id=
        "I873">Betty</span> am kept busy every minute, so letter writing is
        generally put aside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of you have no doubt heard of <span wc_id="I836">Papa</span>'s
        death which occured last October while he was visiting at his boyhood
        home in Tioga, Pa. It came as a shock to us all as he had seemed to be
        in good health for some time. It was very hard indeed to take up life
        again without him.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I848">Lynn</span> and <span wc_id="I855">Donald</span> are
        both working and doing splendidly and each has a car which we enjoy
        very much.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I864">Billy</span> is doing very nicely in school; he had
        quite a severe accident to his right hand last year just before school
        closed, while in his woodworking class. He nearly severed the index
        finger and when it healed there was a swelling on the knuckle which
        caused stiffness in the joint. During his Easter vacation we had an
        Xray taken which revealed a splinter of bone in the joint so he went
        back in the hospital and was operated on by a specialist and is just
        now recovering but we feel it is not much better. We are very anxious
        because it will be such a handicap to his athletics when he enters
        college.
      </p>
      <p>
        Betty, my youngest, is getting along famously and just at present her
        time is very much occupied in school by an Operetta which is to take
        place the first of June. She has been taking Character and Interprative
        Dancing at Eastman School of Dramatic Art<sup>2</sup> this winter so
        she has been quite a busy girlie, and is very well.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are very pleasantly situated here in Rochester and are very glad we
        located here as there are so many privileges for the children in school
        and wonderful opportunities for us all.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have a radio from which we derive a lot of pleasure and are always
        hoping we may hear some of the Cousins broadcasting.<sup>3</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The boys join us in sending love to you all,
      </p>

        3. Radio was a big thing, mentioned in many of the CCC letters. It's
        widespread use was fairly new. Just the previous year, Calvin Coolidge
        became the first president to broadcast his inagural address. And,
        listening for Cousins wasn't just a fantasy. Radio stations in several
        major cities carried performances by some, such as <span wc_id=
        "I1537">Edward Young</span> and <span wc_id="I1478">Harry
        Campbell</span>.
