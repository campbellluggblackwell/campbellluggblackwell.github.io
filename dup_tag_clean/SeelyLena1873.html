      Lena SEELY Goodrich (1873 - 1954)
    </h1>
    <p class="western">
      Lena Edna Seely was born Jul. 24, 1873, in Nelson, Tioga Co., PA; d. Mar.
      6, 1954 in Pittsfield, MA. Married Jun. 6, 1907 in Nelson to <span wc_id=
      "I977">David Zebulon Goodrich</span>, b. Jun. 9, 1874, in Nelson; d.
      there 1908. Dave's parents were Rev. <span wc_id="I978">Henry David
      Goodrich</span>, born 1844 in Delaware Co., NY, and <span wc_id=
      "I979">Elizabeth Batterham</span> (pronounced "BAT-trum"), born 1847 in
      IL.
    </p>
    <p class="western">
      Lena was the elder of 2 children of <a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">Mark
      Seely</a>, b. 1847 in Osceola, Tioga Co., PA, d. 1932 in Nelson; and
      <span wc_id="I973">Susan E. Losey</span>, born 1856 in Nelson, d. in 1894
      in Osceola.<br>
      <br>
      Lena was profoundly deaf as a result of having scarlet fever as a girl.
      She kept a pad and pencil close at hand, so that people who wanted to
      communicate with her could write out what they wanted to say to her.
      While married to Dave, and for several years after, she lived in a small
      house behind her father's dry goods store, which was on the main street
      of Nelson, opposite from the old post office. From 1923 on, she lived in
      Pittsfield, MA with her sister, <span wc_id="I981">Emily SEELY</span>
      Blanchard.<br>
      <br>
      Dave's sister, <a href="GoodrichFrances1871.html">Frances Goodrich</a>,
      married Mark Seely's 1st cousin, <span wc_id="I1249">Joseph D.
      Hoyt</span>. Additionally, Dave was a great-uncle, by marriage, to
      Campbell Cousin <span wc_id="I1806">Ande RICE</span> Tubbs. There's a sad
      side to their story --- Lena and Dave postponed their marriage for a year
      while Dave was supporting his widowed sister and paying for her to be
      trained as a seamstress to become self supporting. Dave and Lean were
      married for only a year before he died.

      Dave and Lena Seely Goodrich had no children.
