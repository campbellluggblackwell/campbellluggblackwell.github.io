      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span wc_id="I1543">Mrs. Rebecca Lugg</span>, died at
      her home in Nelson on Saturday, the 16th instant, aged 54 years. Mrs.
      Lugg had been an invalid for some time, but her death was a shock to her
      relatives and friends, who had supposed that she was improving. Acute
      Bright's disease was the immediate cause of her death. She leaves four
      children to mourn her loss---<span wc_id="I2579">C. B. Lugg</span>,

      Oscar Cole</span>, and <span wc_id="I2596">Mrs. Jesse Howe</span>; also a
      sister <span wc_id="I1540">Mrs. Dolly Campbell</span>, and one brother,
      Jerome Bottom, besides numerous relatives and friends. The funeral was
      held on Monday in the Presbyterian church, she having long been a member
      of that society. Rev. Mr. Armstrong preached an excellent sermon.
      Beautiful flowers---roses, carnations and similax covered the casket as
      they laid her remains beside those of her husband, who died five years
      ago. Friends were present from Bradford, Wellsboro, Elkland, Corning and
      Elmira.<br>
