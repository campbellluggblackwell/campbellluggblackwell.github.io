        Dear Cousins and All:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I hardly know where to begin to write my first contribution to our
        wonderful book of letters. I am most happy to be included with the ones
        who are members of this fine organization.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        When <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a> asked me to assist
        him as secretary I hesitated, as I was not capable of handling such a
        stupendous task, but on further consideration I felt it was my duty to
        do my part, and help to carry on the plan that had such a successful
        beginning. After the letters are all in, and all the books are ready to
        mail, I expect to realize more what Cousin Will has done for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are looking forward with a great deal of pleasure to a visit from
        Cousins Will and <span wc_id="I1604">Edith</span> early in April. As
        this is their first visit to our capital city we are planning a
        pleasant time visiting, sight-seeing and talking business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Washington seems to be a go-between for the travelers from the north
        and south<sup>1</sup>. We are glad, for occasionally it gives us the
        opportunity to see some of our friends and relatives. Cousins <a href=
        "CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a> and <a href=
        "ParksFrances1855.html">Frank</a> and <a href=
        "CampbellMary1851.html">Mary Shipman</a> spent a few days with us on
        their way to Florida and we enjoyed them so much. I was surprised one
        evening soon after their visit to meet Cousin <a href=
        "YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil Young</a> and his <span wc_id=
        "I1497">wife</span>. They were in Washington for just a few hours but
        it seemed good to get even a hand-shake.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish it was possible for all the Cousins to see our beautiful city;
        we do not appreciate all the wonderful things for we do not have time
        to enjoy them&nbsp; and there are so many new things all the time. Some
        of the agricultural buildings are across the corner from the building
        where I am employed and last week we went over at lunch time to enjoy
        the amaryllis show. The blooms were wonderful and of course are more
        beautiful each year.

        <a href="CraneJennie1852.html">Mother</a> has written a <a href=
        "CCCV2p006JennieBosard.html">letter</a> of some of her first knowledge
        of the Campbell family. I remember of seeing several of the great aunts
        and uncles and knew some of them real well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Must not make my first letter too long. With best wishes to all.

      1. Most of them would have been traveling by train; it took a week to
      drive from PA to FL back then, in part because of the cars, but mostly
      because of the dirt roads and having to drive through the center of
      cities and towns. - wbt<br>
