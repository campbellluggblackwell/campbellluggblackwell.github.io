      <p>
        The 34th Annual reunion of the Campbell Clan was held at Nelson Aug.
        19, 1926.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over 100 members availed themselves of this friendly fellowship.
      </p>
      <p>
        The committee in charge gave their best in making arrangements and
        carrying out the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        The committee on place of meeting secured the I.O.O.F. Hall and the
        refreshments committee was early on hand and spared no pains in
        arranging the dinner. The reception committee made each one feel the
        "at homeness" which makes a real reunion.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the first tablespoonsfull had satisfied the natural appetite with
        the bountiful dinner served by willing hands they were entertained by
        Prof. Dann and family and when all had been served to dinner the Pres.
        <span wc_id="I2516">C.H. Lugg</span> took the chair and called the
        social and business meeting to order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Chas. Congdon</a> let the Clan
        in singing "America the Beautiful" and "America" in his own masterful
        manner, with <span wc_id="I9930">Mrs. James Parks</span> at the piano.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Rev. <span wc_id="I1641">Coral Butler</span> offered prayer
        Cousin <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel Shaw</a> took charge of
        the program and in her able way made this hour of the day vie with the
        bountiful dinner in enjoyment and satisfaction to those present. She
        spoke of those of our number who have made for themselves names in the
        musical world as <span wc_id="I695">E. L. Monroe</span>, <span wc_id=
        "I1537">Edward Young</span>, <span wc_id="I1478">Harry Campbell</span>
        & C. H. Congdon. But added we have musical ability in our younger
        cousins & stated we were to be favored with music by some of them. She
        then called on <span wc_id="I1648">Gertrude</span> and <span wc_id=
        "I1650">Mary Butler</span> of the "<a href=
        "CampbellJames1798.html">James Campbell</a> family" who then favored us
        with a piano duet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cousin Mabel said the committee had tried to have a representative from
        each branch of the Clan have a part on the program; so she asked C.H.
        Lugg to represent the "Lugg unit"<sup>1</sup> with a word of welcome -
        Altho it was the "Irishman's Surprise" to him he extended a hearty
        welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        A clarinet solo by <span wc_id="I785">George Wilson</span> was so
        pleasing that he was encored & cheerfully responded. <span wc_id=
        "I693">Fannie Monroe</span> in behalf of the "Hazlett
        family",<sup>2</sup> gave a reading, for the benefit of our cousins
        from the Sunny South she said, entitled "A Colored
        Wedding".<sup>3</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        A Piano Solo by Master <span wc_id="I759">Francis Hall</span> of the
        "Merritt family"<sup>4</sup> was encored & our little cousin responded
        very readily to the pleasure of his audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Mrs. E. S. Horton</a> of the "Joseph
        Campbell family" gave an interesting paper containing facts gathered
        from previous Reunion minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        When <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Cousin Tommie</a> was called on
        for remarks he told us he is so full of Florida with its sunshine and
        flowers he can not talk without speaking of it & he is sure the birds
        sing sweeter, the flowers are more fragrant & and the moon is bigger in
        St. Petersburg than any where else in the World, He read an account of
        "A Colored Funeral"<sup>2</sup> to compliment Fannie's "A Colored
        Wedding" story.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1896">Clyde Campbell</span> responded to a request for an
        impromptu speech and again the "James Campbell family" was represented.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1644">Seldon Butler</span> favored us with a vocal solo
        entitled Fast Falls the Eventide and responded to the encore with
        another sacred selection.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I5067">Arthur McKean</span> of the "Blackwell
        family"<sup>5</sup> gave some interesting facts about the Blackwells &
        invited us all to come to Troy to examine his family records.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">George Buck</a> reminded us it is real
        worth or character he prizes most in his very favorably recollections
        of his ancestry & he is instilling in the minds of his sons the need of
        "carrying on" - the best from the lives of those who have passed on
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        After remarks by <span wc_id="I1693">Mr. Shuman</span> <span class=
        "Annotation">[sic]</span> Mrs. Shaw was asked by cousin <a href=
        "ParksFrances1855.html">Frank Campbell</a> to favor us with some songs
        she learned while in the South last winter. One of the several
        selections given was of more than passing interest because of the very
        precious "Truth" couched in the negro dialect<sup>3</sup> which ran
        something like this-<br>
        What done to my Lord by Hisself alone (repeated twice)<br>
        Nailed him to the cross by Hisself alone (repeated twice)<br>
        Never said a mumblin word by Hisself alone (repeated twice)
      </p>
      <p>
        Without doubt it drew out of all of our hearts to a deeper love for Him
        who so willingly gave His life that we through His sacrifice may have
        Eternal Life.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I685">J. E. Hazlett</span> made a plea for financial help
        for needed repairs on the Beechers Island Pres. Church where many of
        the Clans forefathers worshiped.
      </p>
      <p>
        "America the Beloved" was heartily sung as Chas. Congdon again led &
        thus ended the excellent program provided by our committee
      </p>
      <p>
        Minutes of 1925 meeting were read & approved <span wc_id="I2369">E. C.
        Blackwell</span> presented the financial need & the generous offering
        of $16.50 was given to which cousin <span wc_id="I1760">Harry
        Kemp</span> added another dollar making it $17.50 in all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edward Monroe at this time favored us with two solos which were greatly
        enjoyed by all present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Officers for 1927 were elected as follows.<br>
        Harry Kemp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        President<br>
        <span wc_id="I1764">Mrs. Harry Kemp</span>&nbsp; Sec. & Treas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Pres. called for impromptu talks & the following responded. Harry
        Kemp, Chas. Congdon, <span wc_id="I2541">Waldo Lugg</span>, C.H. Lugg,
        T.C. Campbell. Clyde Campbell requested Harry Kemp get data and facts
        concerning the Campbells from his father <span wc_id="I1729">David
        Kemp</span> & give them at the reunion in 1927 & regretted "uncle
        David" could not be with us this year.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1718">Carrie Smith</span> by request gave a reading
        entitled "The Christmas Story" in negro dialect and Mrs. Shaw told us
        about her experience with "Uncle Tommy's" colored man.<sup>3</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Cousins <a href="CongdonEmma1848.html">Emma Buck</a>, <span wc_id=
        "I1916">Anna Miner</span>, <span wc_id="I5620">Carson Blackwell</span>
        & <span wc_id="I666">John Hazlett</span> also gave talks. Cousin John
        suggested the reunion in 1927 be held on the H.S. grounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Informally adjourned.

      <p>
        Aug. 19, 1926 Minnie J. Lugg, Treas.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. Descendants of James or his brother <a href=
        "CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph Campbell</a>, are also Luggs because
        their wives were daughters of <a href="LuggSarah1778.html">Sarah
        Lugg</a>. C. H. Lugg, like all of our cousins that still carry the Lugg
        surname, was a descendant of Sarah's brother, <a href=
        "LuggCharles1791.html">Charles Byron Lugg</a>.
      </p>2. Three of Joseph and Mary Harper Campbell's daughters married
      Hazletts. Fannie was a descendant of <a href="CampbellJane1792.html">Jane
      Campbell</a>, who married John Hazlett. Our other Hazlett branches are
      descendants of Jane's sister, <a href="CampbellSarah1777.html">Sally
      Campbell</a>, who married John's brother, Sam Hazlett. And descendants of
      their sister, <a href="CampbellMary1779.html">Mary Campbell</a>, who
      married a different (as far as we know unrelated) John Hazlett -&nbsp;
      haven't yet participated, but we are now in touch and hope they will join
      us soon.
      <p>
        3. Everyone is a product of their times. It's unfair to judge people
        born and raised in the19th century by the standards of the 21st
        century. Our Campbell Cousins of 1925 were "God fearing" pillars of
        their communities. But racial stereotypes and prejudice were pervasive
        in 1920s&nbsp; America. The '20s & '30s were a high point of KKK
        activity, with hundreds of lynchings. Large KKK parades were held in
        Binghamton and other Northern cities. There were "Jim Crow" laws
        throughout the South. Fortunately our awareness of discrimination and
        prejudice has improved in the last 90 years. But I wonder what things
        in our writings will cause people 90 years from now to say "How could
        they be oblivious of ___?" - wbt
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Our Merritts are descendants of Jane CAMPBELL Hazlett. When [Edwin
        ]Francis Hall grew up, he married Cousin Helen Van Dusen, a descendant
        of Jos. & Ann Clinch Campbell.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. All of the Blackwells that came to our reunions were descendents of
        <span wc_id="I2434">John Blackwell</span> (1734 - 1824), whose will is
        on our website. Most were descendants of his son, <a href=
        "BlackwellEnoch1764ca.html">Enoch Blackwell</a> (ca 1764 - 1816), but
        some were descendents of various siblings of Enoch. Enoch had 7
        children by his first wife, Hannah Perrin, and 2 by his 2nd wife, Sarah
        Lugg. aaaThe maternal grandfather of the speaker, Arthur Blackwell
        McKean, was a descendant of Hannah Perrin. Arthur's maternal
        grandmother, was a descendant of one of Enoch's brothers. It doesn't
        make genealogical sense, but the attendees of these reunions apparently
        didn't think of James Campbell's descendents as also being Luggs and
        Blackwells. Nor of the descendants of his brother, Joseph Campbell as
        also being Luggs.
