        Dear Cousins:
      </p>

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Since we circulated our last letters you have acquired a new
        cousin-by-marriage. Last October I was married to Miss <span wc_id=
        "I1533">Martha Jane Phillips</span> of Springfield <span class=
        "Annotation">[Twp]</span> (near Troy), Pennsylvania. The ceremony took
        place in the chapel of the Union Theological Seminary in New York. On
        the Seminary's beautiful organ my brother Edward furnished the music
        for the occasion.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a few days at Atlantic City I brought my bride to Rockville
        Centre, where we are occupying the new Manse which the church purchased
        last summer. Keeping up with activities of a growing and busy church
        makes the task of getting settled for housekeeping doubly difficult,
        but we are beginning to feel comfortable, and extend to any of you who
        happen our way a cordial invitation to drop in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Martha joins me in looking forward to the time when we can attend a
        Campbell Reunion and meet you all. In the meantime we send our very
        best regards.
      </p>
