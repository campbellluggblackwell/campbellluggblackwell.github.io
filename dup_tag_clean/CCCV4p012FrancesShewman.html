        Dear Campbell Cousins:-

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        For sometime I've been wondering when we "third raters" were ever going
        to get a chance at the Cousins Book and now that the chance is here
        I've been wondering what I could ever write that would be of interest
        to any one. The fact is, there haven't many little things happened in
        our family. We are all here in St. Petersburg, well and happy. I'm an
        old maid, but there aren't many in the Campbell Family and I'm having a
        good time. I have a position with a landscape architect's firm,
        painting plans of Golf Courses, sub-divisions, etc. They build some of
        the finest Golf Courses in the country. Being connected with this sort
        of work has aroused my interest in the game so I'm trying to play in
        all the spare time I have. In fact I like it so well I wish I had
        nothing else to do. Net week-end our Office force are being entertained
        at the Country Club of one of our clients, We were given a similar
        outing in the fall and had such a wonderful time that we are all
        looking forward to another good time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess those of you who haven't been in Florida have heard all about
        it in previous letters so I won't tell you anything more - only wish
        you could all be here to enjoy this beautiful climate.
      </p>
