    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span wc_id="I2000">Myra</span>, daughter of Mr. and
    Mrs. Harvey Merritt of Farmington, died Monday morning, Sept. 7, of typhoid
    fever, aged about 20 years. The funeral services were held at the home in
    Farmington, Wednesday, September 9, at 12:30 o'clock, Rev. Mulford, of
    Tioga officiating.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three weeks previous, at the home and at the same hour
    on which her funeral was appointed, she was united in marriage to Mr.
    <span wc_id="I1998">Wm. Close</span>, of Farmington, by Rev. Mr.
    Chamberlain. This fact seemed to make the occasion a doubly sad one and the
    many friends who were present at the funeral obsequies extend very deep
    sympathies to the bereaved husband, father and mother.<br>
    [<small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Note: Myra Merritt
    was a daughter of Joseph Harvey Merritt, aka Harvey Joseph Merritt, (not to
    be confused with "our" Harvey Grant Merritt). J. Harvey Merritt was a son
    of Hiram J. Merrit, who was a brother of the William Merritt who married
    <span wc_id="I78">Eliza Hazlett</span>. Myra is in our tree because of
    William E. Close. William, by his subsequent marriage to Shirley A. Brown,
    was the father of Merritt Brown Close, who married Campbell Cousin
