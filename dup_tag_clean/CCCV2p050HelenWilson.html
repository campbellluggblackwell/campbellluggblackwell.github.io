        Dear Cousins:

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I am very glad to contribute a message to the Cousins Correspondence. I
        always enjoy reading the letters from the others as soon as they are
        received.

        With the two boys, <span wc_id="I783">Richard</span> and <span wc_id=
        "I785">George Robert</span>, we are very busy and happy. The boys are
        both in Junior High School, -- are both very musical and are playing
        some instrument or whistling most of the time. George Robert is twelve
        years old and plays instruments from Jews Harp to violin upon which he
        is taking lessons. Richard, fourteen years old, enjoys his drum. I am
        teaching music and have an orchestra of eleven children which we call
        the Mah Jongg Orchestra. We all love music.

        Some of you may have remember <span wc_id="I704">Uncle John</span> and
        <span wc_id="I703">Aunt Dell</span> Shipman<sup>1</sup>. They have
        lived here in Mansfield for eleven years. On March 18th, they
        celebrated their Golden Wedding Anniversary by giving a six o'clock
        dinner at their home to sixteen relatives, three of whom were at their
        wedding in 1874. These were Aunt Dell's sisters, <span wc_id=
        "I709">Mrs. Taft</span> and <span wc_id="I750">Mrs.
        Hall</span><sup>2</sup> and Uncle Will Shipman.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their only daughter, <span wc_id="I707">Carrie</span><sup>3</sup> died
        five years ago. They received about a hundred cards and lovely
        greetings, many of them from you.
