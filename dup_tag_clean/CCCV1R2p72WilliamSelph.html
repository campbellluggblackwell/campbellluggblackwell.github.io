          Dear Cousins:-
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Message">
        <p>
          Since our last exchange of letters in June, we have had the pleasure
          of visiting a great many of the Cousins in Tioga County [PA]. It had
          been four years since we had made similar visits and needless to say,
          every minute of our vacation was most pleasantly spent. It was nice
          to travel again over the same fields and roads of my boyhood days.
          Whenever I visit the old farm of Uncle <span wc_id="I1035">Allen
          Seely</span>, I cannot resist the temptation to tramp up to the Glen
          and then come back and wander around the numerous buildings which
          surround the old homestead.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the Tioga County Trip in July, we also motored up in
          the Finger Lakes section of New York State, visiting friends of other
          days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then in August, we had the pleasure of spending eight days at Ocean
          Grove by the seashore. This is a most delightful resort and some of
          you have been there. The old Ocean is always nice and the evening
          strolls on the Board Walk or listening to a fine address or musical
          program in the Auditorium are always inspiring.<span wc_id=
          "I13638"></span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The third and last motor trip of the season was a week in September
          when we took our <span wc_id="I1605">daughter</span> to Wheaton
          College in Massachusetts and after seeing her nicely installed there
          spent a delightful couple of days out on Cape Cod.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then in October came the finish of the National and American League
          Base Ball season, followed closely by the famous World Series Games.
          Although I have not witnessed any of the regular season games for
          three or four years, I always manage to attend some of the World
          Series Games if they are played in New York. I witnessed three of the
          games, being present when at the second game, when the mighty Babe
          Ruth knocked two home runs in successive innings. Perhaps I was the
          only descendant of the <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph
          Campbell</a> family to witness this wonderful feat. I can only
          imagine that <span wc_id="I787">Lish Horton</span>, <span wc_id=
          "I790">Frank Horton</span>, <span wc_id="I816">Clark Kimball</span>,
          <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil Young</a>, <a href=
          "CampbellWilliam1864.html">Will Campbell</a> and about forty-nine
          other of the men folks would have enjoyed these games.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          As I shall have a few suggestions to make about the Correspondence
          Club, I must not go into detail in this regular letter, but will
          simply say that it has been a great pleasure on my part to help bring
          about this semi-annual exchange of letters between ourselves and I
          seem to have taken an unusual amount of pride in the matter.

          I am very glad that our second Cousins (the fourth generation)
          <span class="Annotation">[note that Will uses "first cousins" to
          refer to the grandchildren of <a href=
          "CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph</a> and <a href=
          "ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann Clinch</a> Campbell and "second cousins" to
          refer to Joseph and Ann's great-grandchildren --- to a genealogist,
          Will's 2nd cousins would be the children of his parents' first
          cousins. The way Will is using the term, he is one of the "first
          cousins" and his daughter is one of the "second cousins"-wbt]</span>
          have entered so heartily into our plans; every letter in this Report
          is simply fine and I cannot express to you how much I&nbsp;
          appreciate the co-operation you have given me. It will not be many
          years before a number of the first cousins (or third generation) will
          be reduced to a minimum. It will then devolve upon the second Cousins
          to continue the program which has been started. I am sure all will
          agree on this one point, viz: that our plan is a success right from
          the start, and already has so much momentum that it would be
          impossible to stop it. I have made a number of inquiries amongst
          outside people and have yet not yet found that any other family is
          conducting a Correspondence Club similar to ours. In this particular
          respect, therefore, our plan is distinctive, and unique. Needless to
          say, the careful planning and working out of all the details has
          consumed a vast amount of time on my part. The very fact, however,
          that our family was scattered all over the country and the further
          fact that we knew so little of each other, and in many cases, had not
          seen each other,- suggested to me the idea of some sort of a plan,
          whereby, as <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommy Campbell</a> put
          it, "we might again be a reunited family." I simply wanted to start
          something, while I am yet here and perform a service, which would be
          of great value to all of us,--and which could very easily be carried
          on year after year with very little difficulty. I am in hope that
          before our next Report, I shall be able to make other arrangements
          whereby a portion of the work of getting out these letters can be
          taken over by some of the other Cousins. A number have already
          volunteered and I believe it will be possible to divide the
          responsibility somewhat so as to relieve me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since our last exchange of letters one of our Cousins by
          marriage,--<span wc_id="I722">Dellie Van Dusen</span>,-passed away on
          June 29th, 1923, and to Cousin <a href="TubbsAnn1855.html">Ann Van
          Dusen</a>, we extend our heartfelt sympathies. One by one the present
          generation of First Cousins in the Joseph Campbell Family will be
          called to their reward, and the work which they had planned to do in
          this life will have to be carried on by their descendants. In every
          single case, however, the fourth generation (or second Cousins) are
          well equipped to take over the larger tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          In closing, may I extend to each of the first and second Cousins a
          most cordial invitation to visit us whenever you are in New York
          City. The latch is on the outside and we would be most delighted to
          have you come and see us whenever itg is possible to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          With very best wishes, believe me,
