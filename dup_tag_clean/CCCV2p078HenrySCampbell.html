      <p>
        My dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        To be able to write a Round Robin to so many of my kin is really a
        treat for me, and the volume of letters is of great interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I am one of the few Western Cousins, I presume I should come
        through with a wild and wooly addition to the Campbell letters and
        perhaps even wax poetic over the great open spaces, et cetera.
        Unfortunately, I have long since discarded spurs and chaps, so can
        offer you nothing of the romance of our famed Golden West.
      </p>
      <p>
        If our strenuous April showers permit, <a href=
        "CampbellWilliam1864.html">Dad</a> and I will go into intensive
        training, shortly, for the family golf trophy must be wrestled from my
        brother <span wc_id="I916">Bill</span> as soon as he returns from
        school<sup>1</sup>. Though he has been a long time "too busy," Dad has
        finally joined his two sons and has become quite a golf bug.
      </p>
      <p>
        If my plans materialize, Dad and <span wc_id="I905">Mother</span> will
        motor East in June to bring the brother home from school and I'm sure
        they will renew acquaintances in as many localities as their time will
        permit. You see, I am still very much unattached and will have ample
        time to direct the Campbell interests during their leave of absence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dad came closer to calling on <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Uncle
        Tommie</a> in St. Petersburg this winter than any previous year, so I
        really believe his motor jaunt will go through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anxiously awaiting the next edition of "The Campbell Cousins Conduct,"
        I am,
