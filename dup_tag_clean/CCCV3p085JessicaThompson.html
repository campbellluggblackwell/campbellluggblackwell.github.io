        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        It really doesn't seem possible that a year can have gone by since our
        last Cousins Letters. We have had a very busy and happy year. At the
        time of the Cousins Letters last year <span wc_id="I1251">Walter</span>
        and the youngsters<sup>1</sup> were all ill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last fall we moved into the country, just a mile from city
        limits<sup>2</sup>. It's a wonderful place for the youngsters and we
        all like it here very much. The youngsters are much stronger and I
        think Walter is somewhat better. He goes back and forth to work in his
        "Lizzie"<sup>3</sup> every day and spends all his spare time out of
        doors. He is foreman in the shop and doing very well at his work.
      </p>

        I have taught the district school here this winter. It is just across
        the road from our house. I have about thirty pupils of five grades and
        have found it very, very interesting. As there is no church here the
        school plays an unusually important part in the community. My
        Scotch-Presbyterian upbringing combined with my Goodrich "preacher"
        inheritance have made it impossible for me to live in a community
        without a Sunday School, so I am having Sunday School here at our house
        every Sunday A.M. I wish you could have seen the nice little session
        that we have just had. All the youngsters in the district, including
        two Catholics, were here. I am rather an amateur along this line, so if
        anyone has any ideas that may help out, send them along. I am also
        planning to start a Parent-Teacher Association in the last part of this
        month. Besides this, I have been taking courses in nutrition and
        millinery in the city this winter. So, you see I haven't had time to
        develop much of a "complex."

        <span wc_id="I1256">Tom</span> and <span wc_id="I1262">Anne
        Betty</span> come to my school, of course, and think it great fun.
        <span wc_id="I1266">Henry</span> gets more cunning<sup>4</sup> every
        day and is a very sturdy little chap. <a href=
        "GoodrichFrances1871.html">Mother</a> was here for five weeks in the
        fall and <a href="HoytInez1871.html">Auntie</a> for a week. At present
        Mother is at Osceola where she has been nearly all winter because of
        <span wc_id="I979">Grandma Goodrich</span>'s illness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Was so sorry to hear of Cousin <a href=
        "CraneJennie1852.html">Jennie</a>'s death and also of <span wc_id=
        "I1448">Ross Van Dusen</span>'s sudden death which seemed such a very
        sad thing. I wish to extend my sympathy to both families as well as to
        Cousin <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Anne Owlett</a>.

        2. They lived in several "country" locations just outside Binghamton,
        but I think this was at Choconut, north of the city on the Stella New
        Ireland Rd. It later got a church.
