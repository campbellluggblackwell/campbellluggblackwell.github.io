        Dear Kith and Kin, One and All:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        With many months having passed since your most interesting letters, and
        with the numerous changes which have come in the history of our Clan
        since our last issue. I am looking forward with great anticipation to
        the receipt of this coming "budget" of the Cousins Correspondence.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first thought in beginning my visit with you is that I am truly
        proud of the intense loyalty to the enterprise which prompted sixty-one
        of the cousins to respond in the last number. These are pleasant
        reminders which help to make us thankful for life's joys and for Time's
        golden memories which are good and sweet. But I am reminded that sorrow
        has come into the homes and hearts of some of our circle, and taken
        from us those we loved. Cousin <span wc_id="I1102">Andrew
        Owlett</span>, with only a few minutes warning, was called away, and we
        mourned with those to whom he was very dear. Then in December our
        hearts went out to Cousin <a href="TubbsAnn1855.html">Ann VanDusen</a>
        who buried her <span wc_id="I1414">darling boy</span>, and we stood by,
        powerless to comfort her. Then a message came to us of another whom to
        know was to love - Cousin <a href="CraneJennie1852.html">Jennie
        Bosard</a> - and we paused and asked for light to have courage amid the
        tempests of the changing years. We miss them all, and our sympathy goes
        out to the members of their households.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will note by my letter that we are living in St. Petersburg,
        Florida. As our "Honorable Officers" ask for personal news especially,
        I am very glad to tell you of the delightful time we are having here.
        We came the last of November, 1924, responding to the most cordial
        invitation from <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a> and
        <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">Frank</a> when they visited us in the
        summer; and we have enjoyed all the comforts and generous hospitality
        of their "sunny southern home" during the severe winter months of our
        dear old state of Pennsylvania. The outlook was too alluring to resist
        - knowing as we did the wonderful climate in Florida and the pleasure
        of being near them. (We spent the winter of 1920 here).

        So we migrated with the birds and have enjoyed perfect summer weather
        with an abundance of flowers and fruits, open air concerts, lectures,
        air-dome movies, and the finest churches with ministers who have master
        minds, and choirs above the average. Then, too, it has been a great
        privilege to be near Tommie and Frank and their children and families.
        Then to add to our pleasure <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Cousin
        Ed</a> and <span wc_id="I940">Emma Congdon</span> of Tacoma, Washington
        came for three months. They rented a pleasant apartment, and I can not
        tell you what a joy it was to us to have them here. They are true to
        the "faith of our fathers". Many very happy hours we spent together in
        the parks or in their apartment, and they were among the first ones to
        "break bread" with us in our new home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, yes, we have a home of our own here now. Through the brotherly
        advice of Tommie we purchased a lot here when we first came, thinking
        some time perhaps we would build a small bungalow and occasionally
        spend a winter in this "Sunshine City" - for it is really wonderful
        here, and the climate seems to put a new meaning into His promises, and
        a new meaning into His glorious sunshine and His smiling stars and
        "sunny southern moon".
      </p>
      <p>
        So we said, "Hats off to the past" - and "coats off to the future" (for
        it is hot here) - and again, with Tommie to advise, we began to plan to
        build us a home - a home which is now completed and into which we moved
        on March 14, 1925. At present we are very busy improving the grounds
        and putting in tropical shrubbery and citrus fruits. We have a southern
        exposure, and are so near the Gulf of Mexico that both night and day
        are as perfect as you could desire. We have both enjoyed perfect health
        since coming here. But for the great distance between us and our loved
        ones<sup>1</sup>, we should feel "settled for life".
      </p>
      <p>
        However, we expect to go North early in May - as our house in Westfield
        has been closed during our stay here. We have not lost interest in the
        home-folk, especially those of our own kin. We are so happy to know
        that sister <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">Mary</a> is much improved
        in health, and sincerely hope it may be permanent. It was a great
        pleasure last summer to have a visit from brother <a href=
        "CampbellWilliam1864.html">Will</a> and <span wc_id=
        "I905">Louise</span> and Tommie and Frank, and together we made a
        pilgrimage to the home of our childhood in Farmington <span class=
        "Annotation">[Twp.]</span> and lived over again in memory many pleasant
        events, long past, but not forgotten. Sister Mary was too ill to go,
        but I trust when they come this summer that she, too, will be able to
        make the party complete by her presence.

        It was not our privilege to attend the Annual Cousins Dinner at the
        pleasant home of Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie</a>
        and <span wc_id="I961">Anna Congdon</span>. We regretted this very much
        , knowing as we do the warm-hearted hospitality of these big-hearted
        cousins. We were certainly glad to hear from those present that a
        goodly number was there and all enjoyed a glorious good time.

      <p>
        As far as I know, our children are well - but, oh, so far away!
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I close I must congratulate our new "Official Board" on the
        honor conferred upon them. While we very reluctantly give up the
        retiring officers - with many thanks for their efficient services - we
        welcome in the new, promising our hearty cooperation.

      <p>
        With best love to each and every one,
