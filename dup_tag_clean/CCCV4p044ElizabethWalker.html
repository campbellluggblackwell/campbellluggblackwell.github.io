        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I am listening to <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WJZ_(AM)">WJZ</a> tonight and will try
        to write my "Cousins letter" at ehe same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This last winter has been a long winter for us. The roads have all been
        closed since about the first of January. If Cousin <a href=
        "EllisonHugh1888.html">Hugh Ellison</a> would make us a visit now we
        would show him what real snow drifts looked like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Had a letter from <a href="HoytInez1871.html">Auntie</a> this week, she
        enclosed one from Cousin <a href="CongdonEmma1848.html">Em Buck</a> or
        Aunt Em as we girls<sup>1</sup> always called her. How I liked to visit
        her at Sugar Hill,<sup>2</sup> and drive Dexter<sup>3</sup> all over
        the hills.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only time I ever remember seeing Cousin <a href=
        "BuckGeorge1877.html">George</a>, was the first time <a href=
        "GoodrichFrances1871.html">mother</a> and I went there. He was just
        getting ready to leave and Aunt Em had gotten him a lunch and the one
        thing I remember about him was that he put butter on his whipped cream
        cake.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1278">Joe</span> is getting along good in school. He has
        had great sport skiing and riding down hill this winter.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1282">David</span> has been sick a lot, but thinks he wil
        be alrignt again when he can get out doors.<sup>4</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        With best wishes to all,
      </p>

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. By "we girls" Betty meant herself and her two sisters, <span wc_id=
        "I1250">Jessica</span> and <span wc_id="I1285">Isabelle</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. The community of Sugar Hil was in the Town of Orange, Schuyler Co.,
        NY.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Presumably Dexter was a carriage horse of the Buck's and Betty had
        the use of him and a bugy.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Dave remaind an outdoorsman all his life. He was an enthusiastic
        trapper, hunter and fisherman.
