        Dear Cousins and All:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        The time has arrived for us to contribute to our next Cousin's letter.
        Last year at this time we were very busy at home getting things ready
        for the books, watching each mail as it came for new letters, and
        reading them all with a great deal of enjoyment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a> and <span wc_id=
        "I1505">Roswell</span> have both urged us to be prompt, and I am going
        to do my small part this year and be on time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to take this opportunity to thank Cousin <a href=
        "BuckGeorge1877.html">George Buck</a> for assuming the responsibility
        of compiling the books this year. Owing to the loss of our good
        <a href="CraneJennie1852.html">mother</a> it did not seem possible for
        us to do the work at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is very hard for us to get back into the regular routine of every
        day life since our family circle has been broken; but we are confident
        that mother is much happier now and that there has been a reunion of
        loved ones in the Better Land.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1050">Sister</span> has already written her letter and
        mailed it and she has covered, I think, all the items that would
        interest our good cousins.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have so much enjoyed the visits from several cousins, and especially
        the many weeks that Aunt <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Anna Owlett</a>
        spent with us. We hope that more of the cousins will be able to visit
        us in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        With best wishes to all,
      </p>
