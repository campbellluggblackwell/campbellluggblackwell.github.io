            second Cousins' letter finds us still on the Pacific Coast nicely
            situated in our comfortable home in one of the beautiful cities in
            the State of Washington,‑ Tacoma sur­rounded on the North and West
            by Puget Sound, South and East by sparkling fresh water lakes and
            background of mountains, -­Olympics on the North and Cascades on
            East and Mount Tacoma, nearly 15,000 feet high, looming out of the
            sky and when clear looks as though one could walk to its base in
            one hour;-­still it is sixty miles away.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother <a href=
            "CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie</a> and our family had the
            pleasure this summer of taking a trip with auto to this Mountain
            which was called God,‑ to the snow line 9,000 feet high, where we
            had our photos taken among the beautiful wild flowers. The view
            from where we were was indescribably grand,‑ rivers flowing from
            the mountain's side and glaciers of ice working their way down. I
            think Brother Charlie can describe our trip better than I. We
            started early in the morning and returned 8 P.M. We had a grand
            trip. I hope Brother will be with you at the Cousins' dinner.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This being our second letter for Cousins'
            Correspondence Book, I want to tell you all what pleasure and joy
            it was to myself and dear wife to read and re‑read your first
            letters and we are looking forward to the second letters which will
            soon be due, and this will be another bright spot in our lives.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had a beautiful summer,‑ the
            weather has been perfect arid our families have had many pleasant
            auto trips to the lakes, parks, mountains and nearby cities.
            Although I do not think this the only beautiful country, there is
            no valley more beautiful than the old <a href=
            "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowanesque_River">Cowanesque</a>
            where we all received our first impressions of this great world God
            has given us to live in, and how happy every one would be if we
            would follow the teachings of the Master who said, "My peace I give
            unto you, but not as the world gives."<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been greatly blessed in having our
            children settle near us‑‑ just now one of our family is absent,­-
            <span wc_id="I947">Leroy</span>'s wife, Helen, who is visiting in
            the East. We think lots of her and miss her very much. Elizabeth is
            with us while Helen is away and Edgar is with Lee. We have written
            her to attend the Cousins' Dinner if she possibly can. She expects
            to visit Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York before she
            returns. I am sure you will like her,‑ she is</font></font></font>

          bright and full of fun. I hope she can meet you all. She was very
          much interested in reading your first letters.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One word about my wife,‑ she came into the
          family when only a girl and in early life was so closely associated
          with the Cousins that you all seem like brothers and sisters to her;‑
          in fact, you seem closer to her than her own blood relations and how
          she did enjoy her last visit with you all.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span wc_id="I941">Georgia</span> and Oscar
          were over and spent Labor Day with us. We do enjoy their visits when
          they come but they do not come often enough. Georgia is very much
          interested in her work raising flowers for the market,‑ (but Em says
          they don't raise beans). They have a beautiful home facing the Sound.
          Oscar is still working for the Alaska Steamship Company.<br>

          Coast. I am extending this letter too long. We would love to be with
          you at the Cousins' Dinner, September 26th. Hope to be with you
