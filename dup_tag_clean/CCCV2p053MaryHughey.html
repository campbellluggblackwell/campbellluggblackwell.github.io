        Dear Cousins:

      <p>
        I thought surely I'd write a carefully composed letter during my
        vacation last week but before I knew it, it was all gone and my good
        intentions with it. Now I'm stealing time, for I've two sets of papers
        to correct, but I would now want to be delinquent, so here goes.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> suggests that we
        relate the little things that have happened since last fall. Now what
        shall I begin on? Shall I tell you that I have a new hat and coat? No,
        clothes will not interest you, since you've never had a chance to get
        tired of my old ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps you would enjoy hearing about a party I helped give last
        Thursday. Bess Bridges, Allie and Agnes Dickson and I entertained the
        lady teachers that who were here during vacation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Miss Bridges has the group of young hopefuls that I cherished last
        year. Miss Allie Dickson is an English teacher in the High School and
        Miss Agnes, her sister, is a home girl.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party began with a hike in the nature of a hare and hound race.
        Miss Allie and I led the chase, starting a full half hour before the
        rest, strewing confetti in our wake. The hounds followed and we led
        them around for over two hours scaling buttes, crossing fields, running
        down lanes and following the river until at last we returned to the
        starting point.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Dickson's, we served a four course dinner and everyone was hungry
        enough to enjoy it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Covers were laid for twenty-five and decorations were in yellow and
        white. I made imitation chicken pies decorated with baby chicks for
        centerpieces and these held the favors. Yellow ribbons running to each
        plate from the pie hinted at the favors.

        I'm not coming back to Dickinson next year. It looks now as if I'd be
        in Minneapolis as I'm elected there and "negotiations" are in progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd love to come East this summer. The National Education Association
        meets in Washington and I'd like to attend it and swing around by
        Pennsylvania on the home stretch and see all my "dear families." If I
        could pay my way I might do it, but I don't know what kind of agent I'd
        make.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had hoped to enclose some photographs that you might be interested
        in. One of me, for I'm lots better looking than <a href=
        "http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Ecapane/CCCV1R2p04HannahHughey.html">
        that one in Volume No. 1</a>. Honestly, I am! I'll not delay this
        letter any longer, however, but, if possible, I will send some before
        April 15th.
      </p>
      <p>
        Love to all.
