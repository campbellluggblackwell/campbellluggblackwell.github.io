        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Some time ago <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a> hinted
        that one more letter was needed to complete the number he desired for
        this volume, and suggested that I fill the missing link. After many
        reminders from him, I admitted that I was only waiting until
        their<sup>1</sup> promised visit to us was a reality -- then I expected
        to do my bit.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        We did have a wonderful visit with Cousins Will and <span wc_id=
        "I1604">Edith</span> which was altogether too short. We did not know
        Edith very well, -- some of us not at all, -- but as many of you know
        by past experience, it did not take long for us to get acquainted with
        her and learn to love her, -- and to renew the old acquaintance and
        friendship with Cousin Will.
      </p>
      <p>
        We spent some very happy days visiting and sightseeing, -- Washington
        looked very pretty and gay in its new spring attire. The famous
        Japaness <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> cherry trees were in
        their prime, -- throwing a bower of magnificent bloom over the historic
        old Potomac River.
      </p>
      <p>
        Will thinks he has a joke on me, and I suppose he has, for when I went
        to the station to meet them, I let them walk past me unnoticed and when
        I reached home, I found that they had arrived at #211 ahead of me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry as we were to have the friends leave us, it was my pleasure to
        again go to the station this time to see them safely aboard the train
        for New Jersey, thus trying to redeem myself. I will let you be the
        Judge and the Jury to decide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Washington scarcely seems kike itself this spring, because of the
        backward condition of vegetation. However, hot weather will be here
        with a rush very soon, and then we will forget that we had an eight
        inch snow storm on April 1st.

        As the other members of my family<sup>2</sup> have written a letter for
        this edition of the Campbell Cousins Correspondence, there is little of
        personal matter left for me to write. Right here, though, I must
        express to Cousin Will my deep appreciation of the wonderful work he is
        doing, in bringing together the thoughts and interests of those dear to
        each other, who perhaps might never think to write individual letters.
        His generosity, both materially and financially, is almost limitless.

        all in the near future.
