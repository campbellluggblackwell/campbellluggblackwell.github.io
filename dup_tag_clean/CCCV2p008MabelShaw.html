        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The Campbell Correspondence Day has come again I see,<br>
        and <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a> and <a href=
        "BuckGeorge1877.html">Cousin George</a> have written each to me,-<br>
        and <span wc_id="I1050">Mary S.</span> and <a href=
        "BosardFlorence1887.html">Florence B.</a> both sent a word or two<br>
        to tell me I must hurry up if I my duty do.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        So here I sit me down to think, and take my pen in hand<br>
        And try to write a letter to broadcast o'er the land,<br>
        From Oregon<sup>1</sup> to Maplewood<sup>2</sup>, from North to old St.
        Pete<sup>3</sup>,<br>
        My very fondest love I send, my Cousins all to great.
      </p>
      <p>
        What shall I write about I ask, a task I would not shirk,<br>
        Although I want to say to you, it seems a lot of work.<br>
        My family I will tell about as you have told of yours<br>
        And as I tell it I will try to leave out the detours.

        1. Mabel's first cousins: <span wc_id="I790">Frank</span>,
        "<span wc_id="I815">Nellie</span>", <span wc_id="I822">Harry</span> &
        <span wc_id="I828">Arthur Horton</span> lived in Oregon. [wbt]<br>
        <br>
        2. Will Selph, organizer of the Campbell Cousins Correspondence Club,
        lived in Maplewood, N.J. [wbt]<br>
        <br>
        3. Mabel's uncle, Tommie Campbell, lived in St. Pete. [wbt]<br>
        <br>
        4. "of course". When the Campbells immigrated to Pennsylvania (from
        abt, 1776 until 1810), as good Scots, they naturally all were
        Presbyterians. By 1924, thanks in part to several generations, most of
        the "Cousins" were still Presbyterians, but some were Methodist,
        Baptist, Unitarian, and perhaps some "free thinkers" (as doubters were
        called then). I don't think at that time any were Catholic, although
        that came soon after. The inclusion of Jews and Muslims (and probably
        other religions) into our family is quite recent. [wbt]<br>
        <br>
        5. "society" --- i.e. organization. [wbt]<br>
        <br>
        6. Women's Christian Temperance Union. As the name implies, the
        organization started out urging "temperance" (moderation in drinking)
        and working against drunkenness. But as often happens in organizations,
        a more extreme faction took control, replacing the founders, and
        switching the target from "drunkenness" to alcohol itself. [wbt]<br>
        <br>
        7."Scientific Temperance Instruction in Public Schools and Colleges".
        The WCTU pressured local school boards to allow them to present
        lectures on the evils of drink in school classrooms during the school
        day. Reportedly these talks were mostly propaganda, were not science
        based, and contained many distortions and much misinformation. The
        WCTU's early campaigns had little impact on adults' behavior. But the
        school children they indocrinated in school were crucial in passing the
        Prohibition amendment to the constitution. Perhaps there's a lesson to
        be learned about what groups and messages we should grant school time
        to. [wbt]<br>

        My <span wc_id="I780">sister</span> and her two fine boys just live

        That she is well and happy where they do not shovel snow.

        The sunny South is where she's been two months with <a href=
        "CampbellThomas1856.html">Uncle Tom</a><br>
        And doesn't even say a word about her coming home.<br>
        The Southland has a lure to us and in a year or two<br>
        We'll join our southern Cousins where the skies are always blue.
      </p>
      <p>
        To Cousin Will, the pioneer of this our Cousins Club<br>
        We send our words of thanks and say, - He surely is the hub<br>
        But wheels will fall to pieces if no spokes in them are
        found<sup>12</sup>.<br>
        Let's help our officers each time the year comes rolling round.

        As I close my little letter and send it by the post,<br>
        I want to say God Bless you all and may this be our boast,<br>
        That <u>every</u> <u>one</u> of us shall hitch his wagon to a star<br>
        For it is not what we <u>have</u> or <u>do</u>. God sees us as we
        <u>are</u>.

        11. A great many of our early Campbells were leaders in their
        communities or prominent in their fields. As the generations went on,
        the genes became more diluted, the number of descendants vastly
        increased, and times changed. So naturally, the percentage of our
        family that are "prominent" may have decreased. And sad to say, a few
        of our Cousins have even ended up in prison. But many still do play
        significant roles in their fields or communities --- even well into
        their 80s or 90s. So, they're still some good genes in our family and
        good marriage choices have enriched our gene pool. [wbt]<br>
        <br>
        12. Then as now, helpers are needed, both with our reunion association
        and with maintaining and expanding our website and family tree. Things
        fell apart with the original Campbell Reunions after 50 years, the
        Cousins Dinners ceased after 10 or 15 years, and the Correspondence
        Club expired after 4 years. Please don't let it happen again. <a href=
        "volunteer.html">Volunteer</a> to help. We enjoy the fruits of Will
        Selph's labors, but his efforts were not continued. I restarted the
        Campbell Reunions, created and publish our family on-line, and created
        our website. But I'm a geezer and hope others will do their part and
        keep things going after I no longer can. You can start helping
        now.[wbt}
