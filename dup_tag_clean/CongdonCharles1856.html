      Charles Harris Congdon (1856 - 1928)
    </h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Charles "Charlie" Harris Congdon was born Dec. 16, 1856, in Nelson, Tioga
      Co., PA; d. Mar. 23, 1928, in Stroudsburg, Monroe Co., PA. He married
      Apr. 29, 1887, to <span wc_id="I961">Anna Rebecca McWilliams</span>, b.
      1858 in OH.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the youngest of 3 children of <a href=
      "CampbellSarah1824.html">Sarah Campbell</a>, b. 1824, in Nelson, d. 1892
      in Nelson; and <span wc_id="I917">Benjamin Docray Congdon</span>, b.
      1820, on Shelter Island, Suffolk Co., NY, d. 1897. Charlie was a music
      teacher, music superintendent, and publisher of music textbooks.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed his older brother, <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a>,
      and his cousin, <a href="HugheyHerbert1857.html">Herbert Hughey</a>, to
      Brainerd, Crow Wing Co., MN and taught music in the schools there. His
      interest in methods of teaching singing led to his becoming director of
      vocal music, first in St. Paul, MN, and then in Chicago.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlie was one of the most interesting of our Campbell Cousins, and in
      his day the most famous. He was the first member of the family to appear
      in <span style="font-style: italic;">Who's Who</span>. He was also in
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Who's Who in American Music.</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's the entry from Vol 14 of <span style="font-style: italic;">Who's
      Who</span>, p. 494:<br>

    <blockquote>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">CONGDON, Charles Harris, song leader,
      author; b. Nelson, Pa., Dec. 18, 1856; s. Benjamin D. and Sarah
      (Campbell) C.; grad. State Normal College, Mansfield, Pa., 1876; m. Anna

    <p>
      He made the national news when&nbsp; in St. Paul, and later Chicago, he
      had a chorus of children form an American flag for national conventions
      of the G.A.R. (Grand Army of the Republic).<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      He left teaching and established a publishing company in NYC that
      published music for schools and textbooks for music educators. He
      patented a pitch pipe, which his publishing company sold, along with
      other supplies a music teacher might want, such as music stands, batons,
      etc. Many of the songs he wrote had patriotic themes.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      He traveled the country widely promoting his business. Whenever his train
      traveled near a Campbell Cousin, he would stop for a day (or two or
      three) and visit. He was very friendly and well liked and respected by
      his relatives.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the more interesting parts his career was his involvement in
      Theodore Roosevelt's 1912 "Bull Moose" presidential campaign. Charlie led
      music at TR's rallies and the Progressive Party's national convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      By his time, our Campbell clan had diversified religiously. Although many
      still were Presbyterians, by then some were Baptist, Methodist, etc.
      There were even a few Catholics. Charlie switched from Presbyterian to
      Congregationalist, and later was the first of our clan to become a
      Unitarian.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have been a dynamic and interesting person - perhaps charismatic.
      In addition to the above, early 1900s he was proprietor of a vacation
      hotel, the Titania House, on 15 acres next his summer home by Marshalls
      Falls, PA. It previously was called "Hygiene Park", because of the
      beneficial effects mountain air was believed to have in the 1800s. The
      name changed before Charlie took over. Smithfield Twp., Monroe Co., is
      turning the property into a park.

      Charles H. and Anna McWilliams Congdon had 3 children, all born in St.
