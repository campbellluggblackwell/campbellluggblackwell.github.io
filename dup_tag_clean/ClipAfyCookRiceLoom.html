      AN OLD SKILL FROM AN OLD FAMILY
    </h3>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        The soft thump-bump of an ancient loom can be heard any warm afternoon
        within a stone's throw of the Elkland business section where
        beautifully designed rugs flow through the hands of <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cook-28372">Mrs. Beulah Rice</a> who has
        been using this family loom for more than 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mrs. Beulah Rice is pictured here with a section of the rug she is
        currently making after a Swedish pattern given her by Marian Nelson,
        former Elkland resident now living in Utah. Without question, the
        oldest loom still in use in this area and perhaps the first loom ever
        used in Tioga County <span class="Annotation">[PA]</span>, the old
        weaving machine is now erected in a garage at the rear of Hennings
        Hardware. Here, weather permitting, you will find Mrs. Rice turning out
        custom built rugs---a skill she has practiced since she was eleven
        years of age.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mrs. Rice, who lives in the Warburton apartments, moved here from
        Farmington <span class="Annotation">[Twp.]</span> 7 years ago. She has
        been employed intermittently by the Kayser Company<sup>2</sup> but has
        done custom weaving and baking as a major source of income. Her rugs
        are marketed locally at from $5 to $6<sup>3</sup> and require about a
        day to weave.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was born on the Cook homestead north of Nelson at the New York
        State line,<sup>4</sup> the daughter of <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cook-28324">Burton</a> and <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Swan-2688">Jennie (Mary Jane) Swan</a>
        Cook. The loom was an integral part of the Cook household and was used
        by both her <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hazlett-727">grandmother</a> and mother.
        While still a little girl, she learned to operate the loom and make
        pattern changes, which requires more than a day of skillful effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many thousands of wool and cotton rugs have passed through her nimble
        fingers over the years----rag carpeting, which was standard wall to
        wall covering 50 years ago, <a href=
        "https://www.rughookingmagazine.com/Rug-Hooking-Articles/Cant-Miss-with-Hit-or-Miss">
        hit and miss rugs</a>, plaid and stripes. The <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkhurst_Memorial_Presbyterian_Church">Parkhurst
        Memorial Presbyterian Church of Elkland</a> for years raised funds
        through the sale of her rugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        She continued with her weaving while raising four sons, <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Rice-13667">Donald</a>, <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Rice-13838">James</a>, <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Rice-13825">Burton</a> and <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Rice-13832">Harry Rice</a>, all
        well-known local men.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mrs. Rice does not know the exact age of the loom, which has been in
        her family for at least four generations. She is a direct descendent
        <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> of pioneer <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cook-28863">David Cook</a>, who had
        moved into the Corning-Lindley frontier in 1780 and is the great-great
        granddaughter of <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cook-28901">Levi Cook</a>, his son, the
        Cowanesque Valley's first blacksmith who is known to have done work for
        <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Strawbridge-99">James
        Strawbridge</a> at <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deerfield_Township,_Tioga_County,_Pennsylvania">
        Academy Corners</a> in 1791.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Whether the loom came here with David Cook, was built by his son Levi
        Cook or his grandson <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cook-28232">James Cook</a>, is not
        known, however, Mrs. Rice does know that her mother and grandmother
        learned their skills on the device.
      </p>
      <p>
        The loom was well worn and patched when Mrs. Rice first saw it as a
        child. She well remembers that her family obtained wool for the loom
        from a <a href=
        "http://faculty.chemeketa.edu/thodgson/262ON/unit3/OldSturbridgeVillageTour/cardingmill.html">
        carding mill</a> located at Academy Corners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mrs. Rice is related directly and indirectly to many of the early
        families who settled this are the Cooks, the Swans, Campbell's and
        Travers. Her grandfather <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Swan-1288">Samuel Swan</a> operated the
        Addison-Elkland stage; another relative erected the <a href=
        "https://www.joycetice.com/hotels/signor.htm">Hotel Signor</a> in
        December of 1875, The forges and carpenter shops of the Cooks are long
        gone but the old loom which thumps and bumps Elkland's November air
        remains to remember the long line of skilled craftsmen and Workmen who
        came from the blood streams of the men who hued the ancient loom from
        native ash.
