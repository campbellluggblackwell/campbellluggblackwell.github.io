        My dear Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I have been asked to send a letter for this years [sic] "cousin book."
        I had the extreme pleasure of being entertained in the homes of many
        who belong to the Cousin Clan. This I have thoroughly enjoyed as each
        one has seemed to try in their own way to outdo the others for my
        comfort.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I continued to meet other members of this organization, I feel that
        fortune has surely been mine to have made it possible for me to become
        a member of this wonderful Campbell family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our home is made up of four members namely: my good wife <span wc_id=
        "I1050">Mary</span>, and her sister <a href=
        "BosardFlorence1887.html">Florence Bosard</a>, my son <span wc_id=
        "I1052">Austin</span> and myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        A hearty welcome is extended to any of the Cousins who may find it
        possible to pay us a visit. Although I am only an "In-law", the family
        tie is very strong.
