        My Dear Campbell Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        One of my strong points is "always being on time." For several days I
        have been receiving letters from all points of the compass asking me to
        hurry with my letter; as I would not like the 100% to fall short on my
        account I am hurrying. However, it seems I have not much to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        The event in my family since my last letter is the marriage of my
        niece, <span wc_id="I1285">Isabelle</span>, on June 15, 1925, to
        <span wc_id="I1286">Thomas Field</span> of Elmira, - where they reside.
        My sister<sup>1</sup>, <a href="GoodrichFrances1871.html">Frances</a>,
        lives with them. Isabelle keeps her position as Physical Culture
        Teacher, and Tom has a responsible position with the James
        Manufacturing Co., in their Office.
      </p>
      <p>
        In December, I spent one week with my three girls, - going first to
        Binghamton to see <span wc_id="I1250">Jessie</span>. She teaches and
        the two older children, <span wc_id="I1256">Walter Jr.</span> or "Tom"
        as we call him and <span wc_id="I1262">Anne Betty</span>, go to school,
        while <span wc_id="I1266">Henry</span> who is three years old and a
        curly and yellow haired blue eyed darling, if he doesn't take kindly to
        one calls them a "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">bum</span>"
        no matter whether it be the Minister or the County Superintendent. Tom
        is very bright in school work and began music but his mother decided he
        wasn't strong enough yet for so much. Anne Betty is a lovely little
        girl, very dark hair and complexion and eyes. I am "Granny" to Jessie's
        children. Jessie has a housekeeper to take care of the baby through the
        day. <span wc_id="I1251">Walter</span>, has the same work as last year,
        gets good pay, has several men under his management as he is an expert
        workman, - gets pretty mad at some of them at times.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Binghamton I went North to North Brookfield, N.Y., where
        <span wc_id="I1276">Elizabeth</span> still lives, <span wc_id=
        "I1277">Roy</span> works for the D.L.&amp;W. Railroad Co., also sells
        Atwater Kent Radios. As I could hear very well over the
        radio<sup>2</sup> I intend to have one: think maybe I can get it cheap
        as they are in the family, I reached there Sunday morning, found Betty
        entertaining the entertainer on the lyceum courses for over Sunday.<br>

        letter, Inez was quite deaf.

        Betty finds time besides her own work and caring for two lively boys,
        <span wc_id="I1278">Joseph</span>, who is nine and looks like his
        mother and is a very agreeable little fellow, and <span wc_id=
        "I1282">David</span> who is two and a little black eyed imp, -- to
        belong to the Eastern Star, the <a href="http://www.iokds.org/">King's
        daughters</a> and helps in two Church Aid Societies and everything of
        that kind. I heard a sermon over the radio by a Presbyterian Minister
        in Pittsburg <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> and heard every word
        and all the music, which was quite wonderful to me as I had not heard a
        service for years.
      </p>
      <p>
        From North Brookfield, I went to Elmira<sup>3</sup> to see Isabelle and
        Tom. They took me to a good show that evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        I arrived home after one most delightful week. As I left a man and wife
        to keep house, <span wc_id="I1292">William</span> was well cared
        for.<sup>4</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are both very well and very busy. William has the same line of work
        as last year.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were shocked to hear of Cousin <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil
        Young</a>'s death.
      </p>
      <p>
        To each of you I send this wish:-
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "For you I pray, along life's way<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mind with calm contentment
        blest;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good store of health, with some of
        wealth,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With toil enough to sweeten
        rest;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That unto you, the journey through,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The friendship of true
        hearts given;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some tears, some mirth, the best on
        earth,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And at the last a place in
        heaven."

        4. It seems strange to me, because my earliest memories of him are of a
        widower who had been "bach'ing it" as long as I had known him (and
        longer). He was able bodied --- working a farm and having a milk route
        where he'd picked up dairy farmers milk cans and took them to a
        creamery each morning. But at the time, it was not unusual for a man
        not to know how to cook, do laundry, etc. And with two jobs he may not
        have had much time or energy for those tasks even if he did know how.
