        In February, I remember that <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">mamma</a>
        always wrote to your <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">mother</a>, then
        after she was gone to you. I know it is past Aunt Phebe's birthday but
        have thought of you and wondered what you are doing these cold days.
        Isn't this beautiful weather? Very cold today, but clear & nice.

        <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Shaw-15819">Llewellyn</a> is at
        the store as this is Saturday evening and I have been listening to the
        radio. It's always a great wonder to me and I think I shall never get
        over the mystery of it.<sup>1</sup>

        Llewellyn & I are all alone, for the first time nearly, since we have
        been married. It seems queer to have just the two of us. <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cox-26920">Genevieve</a><sup>2</sup>
        says she thinks we should have a chaperone.

        I came across some papers with mention of mamma's death in and am
        enclosing clippings which I thought you might like to have. I intended
        to send them to some of the cousins<sup>3</sup> but only got part way
        around. We miss her more and more & how I long to talk over things with
        her. She was always so cheerful and had such a wonderful mind & heart.

        We<sup>6</sup> are going to take our trip this summer. We sail June 22
        from New York & expect to spend two months away from home visiting
        France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Holland & England. We may
        go to Scotland but are not sure whether we will want to stay another
        eight days. It will be interesting to visit Rome, Pompeii, the
        Catacombs, Venice, etc. We will be eight days in and around Paris -
        five in London. Wish you and <a href=
        "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Boller-100">Will</a> could go along.
