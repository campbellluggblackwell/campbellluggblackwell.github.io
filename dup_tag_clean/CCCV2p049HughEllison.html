        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        We have taken a house out in the country for the summer; it is claimed
        to be on the highest point in Ontario County<sup>1</sup>. It is
        slightly; on a clear day we can see the Atlantic Ocean on the east and
        Lake Michigan on the west, but so far I have not been able to recognize
        <a href="CampbellWilliam1864.html">Uncle Will</a>'s place
        yet<sup>2</sup>, for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I879">Gertrude</span> is still going to school at
        Canandaigua, and <span wc_id="I892">Helen</span> at Victor.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are all having colds and none of us are feeling first class just
        now.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last of March we drove to North Brookfield, N. Y., and had dinner
        with Cousins <span wc_id="I1276">Betty</span> and <span wc_id=
        "I1277">Roy Walker</span>. We certainly enjoyed our time with them, but
        talk about the snow in Potter County<sup>3</sup>, why down there they
        do not pretend to use their snow until it is two or three years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I836">Father Ellison</span> is still living in
        Himrod<sup>4</sup>, but is talking of going to Penn Yan<sup>4</sup> to
        live as <span wc_id="I844">Pauline</span> is going to school there and
        <span wc_id="I842">Frances</span> is going to Keuka College.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did not want to write this letter too soon as I wanted to get in it
        all things of interest; but am afraid <span wc_id=
        "I876">Virginia</span> will have nervous prostration if I do not get it
        off now so I am writing it even though I have nothing to tell.
      </p>

    <div class="Closing">
      Sincerely yours,<br>

    <div class="Footnote">
      1. Ontario County is on the shore of Lake Ontario, and is mostly pretty
      flat. But it's high point (which may or may not have been where Hugh's
      summer home was), is Frost Hill, near Bristol Springs -- height 2,283 ft
      - wbt.<br>
      <br>
      2. As you have probably figured out already, Hugh liked to tell "tall
      tales" --- which I attribute to his being an avid fisherman. Uncle Will's
      place was on Green Bay, on the far side of Lake Michigan, so it's
      understandable if Hugh couldn't quite make it out.<br>
      <br>
      3. PA. I'm not sure what's going on with the sudden shift to talking
      about Potter County. Perhaps <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will
      Selph</a>'s typists omitted a segue when they typed Hugh's letter.
      Perhaps he and Roy talked about fishing there (Roy was an avid fisherman
      too) so that might have been what brought it to mind when Hugh was
      writing this letter.<br>
