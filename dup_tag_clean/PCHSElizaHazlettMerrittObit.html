    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another of the pioneers of Nelson and vicinity has
    passed away. On the 19th of December we followed the remains of
    <span wc_id="I700">William Merritt</span> to the grave. Just eleven weeks
    after, at the same hour of the day, we tenderly and lovingly laid the
    remains of his wife by his side.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliza Hazlett Merritt was the daughter of <a href=
    "HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John Hazlett</a> and <a href=
    "CampbellJane1792.html">Jane Campbell</a> Hazlett. Her parents were of
    Scotch descent and came from the North of Ireland. They were the parents of
    ten children. Three died young, five grew up to manhood and womanhood,
    married and brought up families. Three daughters are still living, the
    others have gone before. The living sisters are Mrs. <span wc_id="I79">Jane
    Knapp</span>, of Nelson, Mrs. <span wc_id="I78">Mary Flint</span> and Mrs.
    <span wc_id="I80">Maria Richardson</span>, of Illinois.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliza A. Hazlett was born March 20, 1825, and died March
    4, 1899, at the age of seventy-three years, eleven months and four days.
    She was married to William Merritt, June 21, 1848. They were spared to each
    other fifty years, five months and twenty-six days. Mrs. Merritt was born
    and lived in Nelson all her life. Perhaps the typesetter left out a
    sentence about deceased children.] The others are all living, namely:
    <span wc_id="I730">C. F. Merritt</span>, Mrs. <span wc_id="I709">Josephine
    Taft</span>, Mrs. <span wc_id="I703">Delphine Shipman</span>, and Mrs.
    <span wc_id="I750">Mary Hall</span>. The son and daughters were untiring in
    their efforts to promote the comfort and welfare of their parents. Mrs.
    Merritt was a great sufferer for many years. She was a faithful wife, a
    kind and loving mother, a good neighbor and everyday Christian.She united
    with the Presbyterian church in Nelson, February 1st, 1845. Thirty-four
    others united with the church at the same time, ten of whom are now living.
    The meeting was held at her father's house, now the residence of
    <span wc_id="I661">Mrs. John Hazlett</span> and her son, <span wc_id=
    "I685">J. E. Hazlett</span>. There were no church buildings in Nelson at
    that time. The pioneers of Nelson are passing away, only two or three are
    now left.<br>
