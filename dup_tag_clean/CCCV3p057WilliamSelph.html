        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        So very many things have transpired in the past twelve months that it
        is rather hard to know just where to begin and what to say that would
        be most interesting to you all. Perhaps the first thing that might be
        mentioned would be the genealogy chart - a copy of which was sent to
        each and every first and second cousin of the Campbell family early
        last summer. I sincerely trust that these charts were all received in
        good condition and have already been protected by suitable frames.
        hardly seems that another year has passed since we wrote our last
        letters. To some it has been a year which has brought sorrow and we
        wish to express our deep sympathy with those cousins who have lost
        loved ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        About the first of June each year we migrate to our cottage at Mt.
        Tabor, from which point we start on our vacation trips. Last summer, in
        company with a couple of friends from Maplewood, we drove out to Cape
        Cod and spent a very delightful ten days. We also had the pleasure of
        another ten day sojourn at Ocean Grove. These two vacation trips
        together with a few shorter ones and the time spend on the golf links
        on Saturdays during the golfing period, made the summer and fall slip
        away before we knew it. Then, about October first, we migrated back to
        our winter quarters at Maplewood, and the winter has likewise slipped
        by all too quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another important event occurred on October fifteenth last when the
        Annual Cousins Dinner was held at <a href=
        "CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie Congdon</a>'s place at Marshall's
        Falls, Pennsylvania. A total of twenty-two cousins sat down to dinner,
        and we all enjoyed a very pleasant time together. <span wc_id=
        "I1604">Edith</span> was suffering with an attack of bronchitis just at
        that time and could not attend the Dinner, but I had the pleasure of
        going up with <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">George</a> and <span wc_id=
        "I927">Anna Buck</span> in their new <a href=
        "http://www.conceptcarz.com/view/photo/767186,17246/1924-Packard-Single-Eight_photo.aspx#photo">
        Packard</a>, and as the day was perfectly gorgeous , we enjoyed the
        ride very much indeed. On the return trip that evening, my sister,
        <a href="SelphJennie1873.html">Jennie</a>, and <span wc_id="I1608">her
        husband</span>, together with <a href="LoopStella1863.html">Stella
        Wilbur</a>, also came back with Cousin George and for the next few days
        we had a smaller reunion in Madison and Maplewood. Cousin <span wc_id=
        "I846">Edna Wright</span> joined us a little later, and we certainly
        did have one royal good time visiting, sight seeing, automobiling, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three of the cousins whose names appear on our genealogy chart have
        been called Home during the past few months, and to each and every
        member of the families afflicted I am sure we all extend our heartfelt
        sympathy. The last one to be called to her reward was cousin <a href=
        "CraneJennie1852.html">Jennie Bosard</a>, who died on February third.
        As you know, Cousin <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Ann Owlett</a> had
        been with

        Cousin Jennie from the middle of last November. Needless to say, Cousin
        Anna's help and cheer in the Washington home was very much appreciated
        and has gone a long way toward making the burden of <span wc_id=
        "I1050">Cousin Mary</span> and <a href="BosardFlorence1887.html">Cousin
        Florence</a> very much lighter. I had been keeping in touch almost
        daily with Cousin Mary and was able to arrange my business affairs so
        that I could attend the funeral service.

        On March seventh it was our pleasure to have Cousins Ann Owlett and
        Mary Snavely come over from Washington and spend a week with us in New
        Jersey, and I feel sure it did Cousin Mary a world of good to have this
        diversion, and as Cousin Ann had never seen our city before, I feel
        that she will always carry with her many pleasant memories of things
        she did while she was here. <span wc_id="I1604">Edith</span> and I have
        been very glad indeed to be favored with the visits of so many of the
        cousins since our last letters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another item which I feel quite sure will be interesting but quite a
        surprise, is the fact that about ten days ago our daughter,
        <span wc_id="I1605">Doris</span>, announced her engagement to
        <span wc_id="I1606">Philip W. Drake</span> of Morristown, N.J. Doris
        has now returned to college and will finish her second year in June. It
        is more than likely that before another exchange of letters she and
        Philip will be married and will make their home in Morristown. It might
        be said that we have known the family for years as they also spend
        their summers at Mt. Tabor. The young man is of high calibre, a worker
        in the church, a fine violinist and bass singer, and comes from a very
        substantial family of fine character. By profession he is the paying
        teller in one of the largest banks in his town. Edith and I, acting as
        a Board of Censor, gave our consent, and we all hope that the
        forth-coming union will prove to be a happy one. While we were just a
        bit disappointed that Doris should not complete her other two years of
        college, yet there are many compensating features to be considered and
        we feel that no mistake has been made. Morristown is only five miles
        from our Tabor cottage and fifteen miles from our Maplewood home, so
        that with good telephone and automotive service<sup>1</sup>, we shall
        see Doris and hear her voice as often as desired.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our plans for the coming summer are rather indefinite, and will depend
        a little upon Doris' plans, and providing, of course, that all of us,
        including Edith's <span wc_id="I13671">mother</span>, are in good
        health, so that we can get away on a couple of trips in case they are
        planned. Personally, I want very much to again drive up to Tioga County
        and visit the cousins up there, and again travel over some of the old
        territory or my boyhood days, especially at Osceola and Nelson. The
        strenuosity of life in a big city like New York makes every business

        1. It&nbsp; may seem stange to modern readers to see "telephone
        service" mentioned because we pretty much take it for granted. But in
        1925, many of the telephone companies were small, "mom & pop"
        operations. Getting a phone installed after moving could take a long
        time. "Private lines" (one household per phone #), which we now take
        for granted, were very rare. Most phones were "party lines", i.e. 4, 6,
        or even a couple dozen houses might share the same phone #. So, you
        couldn't make a call --- or receive a call, if someone else was using
        their phone. But if you wanted to know when the line was available, you
        could just stay on the line and listen to their conversation! The
        operators used distinctive rings so that you could tell if an incoming
        call was for you or for someone else. In 1925 urban phone companies had
        a single button that could be pressed multiple times (e.g.to call '25'
        you would press the key twice, pause, then press it 5 times), or a
        dial, allowing local calls to be placed without operator assistance ---
        but all "long distance" calls required&nbsp; operator assistance.
        Therefore how many operators a phone company "manning" their
        switchboards had a big effect on the adequacy of their service.

        man wish at times that we could just fly away and be up on the old farm
        togged out with an old shirt and a pair of overalls, plugging around
        and getting his mind absolutely away from his business. Whether or not
        I can manage this during the coming summer remains to be seen, but I am
        going to try hard to do it. We also are going to try to reserve time so
        as to be present at the next Cousins Dinner to be held at <a href=
        "TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie Clark</a>'s in Osceola, even if it is
        necessary to go and come by train. These family gatherings are
        certainly very fine and go a long way toward cementing the families
        together.

        I must not make this letter too long or <a href=
        "BuckGeorge1877.html">Cousin George</a> will scold, but I cannot resist
        the temptation to tell you how glad I am that he very kindly and
        unselfishly came to the rescue and will edit and compile our book of
        Cousins Letters this year inasmuch as the cousins in Washington could
        not assume this responsibility.<sup>2</sup> We are indeed to be
        congratulated on having the president of our organization - Cousin
        George - on the job. His business is that of publishing books and I
        know you are going to be delighted with the book this year. George and
        I have had many conferences regarding our book, the last one being late
        yesterday afternoon, when we spent another half hour together going
        over the matters. You will be glad to know that through George's
        efforts the cost of the binding, as well as the entire book, has been
        reduced considerably, which means a little saving for each of us.
        Cousin George will doubtless tell you more about the book itself in his
        own letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today is April eighth and about one-half of the letters are actually
        in. It is my earnest hope and desire that when the book is finally
        closed and ready for binding that at least seventy, or possibly
        seventy-five, letters will be contained therein. We do hope that from
        year to year more of the the cousins will interested themselves in our
        Correspondence Club and do all they can to make it a permanent success.
      </p>
      <p>
        I trust none of the cousins will be offended at being reminded three or
        four times to get their letters in, but the fact is, if we do not have
        the letters we cannot have the book. Let us all, therefore, keep sweet
        and cheerful, and do our little part, knowing that if each one does his
        or her part, the whole thing will come through in just the finest kind
        of shape.
      </p>
      <p>
        With love and best wishes to you all, believe me
