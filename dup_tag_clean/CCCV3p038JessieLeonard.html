        Dear Cousins:

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I have never written to the Cousins Correspondence Club before, and
        have waited this time until the last moment for I felt a little timid,
        and besides I am a very poor hand at writing, as my sister and brothers
        could tell you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can't tell you much about my family as there isn't much to tell. We
        haven't any children - just <span wc_id="I1129">my husband</span> and
        myself - and he is away working most of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess we are all glad to see the spring, for I think this has been a
        long and lonesome winter. Most of you know of my <span wc_id=
        "I1102">Father</span>'s sudden death in September. Then <a href=
        "BosardAnna1860.html">Mother</a> went to Washington in November. She is
        back home now and we were all glad to see her again. I hated to have
        her go, but was glad she could be with <a href=
        "CraneJennie1852.html">Aunt Jennie</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think those genealogy charts <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will
        Selph</a> sent out were fine.<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        I will close with best wishes to all,
      </p>

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. In 1924, Will Selph mailed out a "genealogy chart" showing all the
        descendants as of that tim, of Joseph Campbell (1793 - 1864) & Ann
        Clinch (1804 - 1872). He called it a "chart, but it looked rather like
        a modern spreadsheet --- but handmade by a draftsman, Gathering the
        data data must have been a major effort from Will, and lots of
        cooperation from the Cousins. Many of us till have one of those
        original copies. Having a master handmade, all those copies printed by
        a printer, and mailing one out to each of the Cousins must have been
        expensive, but Will did it as a gift. It's fairly large, so it would
        not be a good candidate to show as a web page. It could be put on the
        web as a high res. JPEG file, but would require several 8.5 x 11 pages
        to print out and tape together. I once made a spreadsheet version,
        spending many hours to make it mimic the appearance the orignal as
        closely as possible. It would be a lot of effort to do the equivalent
        in HTML as a table. The best option for those who would like a copy is
        to come to our 2014 reunion and make a donation.&nbsp;
