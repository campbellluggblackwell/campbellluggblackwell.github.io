        A Brief History of the Campbell Reunions
      </h1>
      <p>
        The first Reunion was held in Nelson at the "instigation" of Phebe
        Campbell Hoyt in<br>
        1893 in Nelson. The reunions continued annually until the 50th in 1942,
        when the<br>
        combination of deaths & geographic scattering brought them to an end.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2000, fifty cousins held a planning meeting at Tioga Lake Park,
        reinstituted the Reunion Association, and made plans for the 51st
        reunion. It was held in Nelson the following year. We now hold them in
        even numbered years and hope that the reunions will continue on a
        regular basis, well into the future.
