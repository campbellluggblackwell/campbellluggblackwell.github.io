        Dear Campbell Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        I am very much pleased to have the opportunity to write to the Campbell
        Cousins. I have often read my <a href="TubbsLeah1884.html">Mother</a>'s
        letters from the Cousins and she has told me who they all are and where
        they live but I know very few of them.
      </p>

        We have had a very long, cold winter. Coal has been scarce but we were
        fortunate to have ours in the bin<sup>1</sup>. Today has been lots
        warmer and it makes you feel good to even think of Spring.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I1347">Cassius</span>, my husband, works in the
        Condensery<sup>2</sup>, but work is not very plentiful.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have a little boy whose name is <span wc_id="I1350">Keith</span>. He
        is three years old the first of April. The thing he likes to do best is
        to "go to Grandma's house".
      </p>
      <p>
        Well now I have written really more than I intended to when I sat down
        and hope to have a chance to write again sometime.
      </p>
      <p>
        Will close with greetings and best wishes to all the Cousins.<br>

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1.&nbsp; After the advent of furnaces and central heat, house in the
        wintry regions usually had coal bins in the basement, often as the
        first room in the front. Coal delivery companies would send truck to
        deliver anywhere from a half ton to several tons, depending on the size
        of the coal bin and the amount of cash on hand. People with coal stoves
        often bought coal by the bag (40, 50 or 100 lbs/bag). Coal delivery day
        was an exciting time or a kid. The truck would back up next to the
        house (snow permitting), they would open a cellar window, insert steel
        chutes, and then shovel the coal onto the chute. It would make a
        glorious whooshing sound as it slid down the chute, and a different
        noise as it cascaded off the end of the chute and fell to the floor.
        Often one of the delivery men would have to be in the coal bin
        shoveling the coal off to a side to make room for the falling coal. Or
        sometimes they could change the angle or length of the chute to make
        the coal fall in a different direction. It was an exciting event for a
        preschooler to watch.

        2. It was in Elkland. Milk route drivers would bring in flat bed trucks
        of milk cans from the dairy farms. They would load the cans onto a
        conveyor, load the empty cans on the truck when they came down, and
        return the empty cans to the milk route trucks, and the drivers would
        return them to the farms The condensery turned the raw milk into
        consumer sized cans of Pet brand condensed milk. Cousin <span wc_id=
        "I1448">Ross Van Dusen</span> managed the plant until his untimely
        death.
