        Dear Cousins:-

      <p>
        I have put off writing this letter hoping for time to compose my
        thoughts properly and inspiration for the thoughts but I can't see that
        I am any better off than I was a month ago. I suppose spring is a good
        time for these letters for it gives an opportunity for a good brain
        house cleaning. My brain is so far from being cluttered with thoughts,
        however, there is nothing worth while to clean out.

        This past year has been quite uneventful with us. We have just kept on
        in the race to find our who wins, the collectors, or we, most of the
        time it is about fifty-fifty.<sup>1</sup>

        <a href="CongdonEmma1848.html">Mother</a> spent the summer with
        <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">George</a> and me last year and we are
        hoping that she will be down this year. While she was with us we made
        the trip to Gettysburg one day. Those of you who have been there know
        what a wonderful trip it is. We spent some time at the Pennsylvania
        Monument hunting the Campbells who had taken part in that battle.
        Mother will probably tell you how she "struck up" an acquaintence with
        a man who knew <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Cousin Tommy</a> and
        kept his car in the Campbell Garage I believe.

        <span wc_id="I932">Betty</span> - now eight years - is in school every
        day. She is finishing Third Grade. Last year she was neither absent or
        tardy once but this year she was sick two days. <span wc_id=
        "I938">Billy</span> - now three years - is a true Scotchman. He always
        says "dinna" for did not; puts his hands behind him as I've seen so
        many of the older men do - <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Uncle
        Charlie</a> and <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Uncle Ed</a> both do -
        <a href="CampbellJohn1836.html">Uncle John Campbell</a> used to.

        I suppose you all know of the great and much talked about <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesquicentennial_Exposition">Sesqui
        Centenial</a> to be held in Philadelphia this summer. It seemed a hard
        fight to get the thing under way but now it it is really to be,
        progress is amazingly rapid. President Coolidge is to be here July 5th,
        I believe, and while June was to have been the official opening date
        the President's visit will mark the real opening. When you plan to
        visit the Fair don't forget that we live near and shall be more than
        glad to see you. The great bridge<sup>2</sup> will then be open so if
        you have your car the drive will be nothing - and the train service is
        always good.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trusting that you all had a successful and happy year and that the
        coming one will be even more successful and happy, we are,
