        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p class="FirstP">
        This being my first letter, perhaps it is best that I tell you who I am
        and a little about myself.I am the oldest of the family of <a href=
        "BosardAnna1860.html">Anna Bosard</a> Owlett; am living at Knoxville,
        Tioga County, Pa., where I have been for the past sixteen years; for
        the past nine years have been in the Dry Goods Store of <span wc_id=
        "I2541">A.W. Lugg</span> & Co. Seven years ago last March I was married
        to <span wc_id="I1110">Marie Perry</span>, a Knoxville girl, but she
        was called home on November 17, 1919.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three years ago this coming winter I spent four months in the beautiful
        city of St. Petersburg, Florida, with Cousin <a href=
        "CampbellThomas1856.html">T.C. Campbell</a> and <a href=
        "ParksFrances1855.html">wife</a>. It was a most glorious winter, - and
        there was only one day during the whole time that the sun did not
        shine, - and that, if I remember rightly, they said was the first day
        without sunshine in three years.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was home this summer for a few days <a href=
        "BosardAnna1860.html">Mother</a> said to me "I have something I want
        you to read,- I think it is just fine and you can have one if you will
        get busy and earn it b writing a few letters."
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, now, I read that first letter (or report) of the Campbell Cousins
        and I did enjoy it, I tell you. Though there are a few of the Cousins I
        have never seen I have heard Mother speak of them often, so I guess I
        should feel as though I knew them all anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was sorry that I could not get to Mansfield <span class=
        "Annotation">[PA]</span> to the Cousins' Dinner this fall but my
        position will not let me go just every time I would like to. I do not
        have a car and the train service is not very good, consequently I have
        to stay home a great many times when I would like to go.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did see <span wc_id="I787">Lish Horton</span> at the Westfield Fair
        at a Ball Game. He was down on the front seat yelling just as loud as
        any of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, dear Cousins, I guess this will have to answer for this time;-
        perhaps I can write a more interesting letter next time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hoping to hear from you all in the near future, I am
