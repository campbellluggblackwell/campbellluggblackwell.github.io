        <big><big>[Note: The original letter was copied by their granddaughter,
        Jessica HOYT Thompson, perhaps in the 1950s. And now transcribed by her
        son, William Thompson. We tried to preserve the original grammar and
        spelling. Wm. Hoyt was a Private in Co. H, 275th Regiment, PA
        Vols.<br></big></big>
      </p>
      <p>
        <big><big>Jessica's notation was:</big></big>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <big><big>"Dody was his 2 year old son. The Watson referred to was a
        prisoner in Libby Prison for years and finally escaped after several
        attempts in which some of the men lost their lives.</big></big>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <big><big>One interesting incident about the Beevers. Some of the
        wounded soldiers were sent home & their families got smallpox.&nbsp; My
        grandmother fed the Beevers by putting food everyday by a stump part
        way [to] their house & vaccinated herself & my father with a piece of
        scab they got some way."</big></big>
      </p>
      <p>
        <big><big>The "awful fight on Sunday" was the April 2nd assault on Ft.
        Gregg, during the battle called Petersburg III. The attack was
        repulsed, but with such heavy Confederate losses, including the death
        of Gen. A. P. Hill, that Lee retreated. "O. Babcock" was probably Sgt.
        Oliver P. Babcock, of Co. H. "Watson" may have referred to Pvt.
        Lawrence Watson, of Co. H. "Beever" probably referred to his neighbor,
        Lewis (or Louis) Beiver/Beaver who was married to Eliza Lugg, 1st
        cousin of Phoebe and daughter of <a href="LuggCharles1791.html">Charles
        Byron Lugg</a>. - wbt]<br></big></big>

        Dear Phoeb,<br></big></big>
      </p>
      <p>
        <big><big>We had an awful fight on Sunday and lost a great many of our
        Men. Watson is gone we don't know whether he was killed or taken
        prisoner. O. Babcock was wounded in the arm. The rest of our boys in
        our company that you know are all right. We have taken Petersburg and I
        was in the city Monday.<br></big></big>

        <big><big>We are on our way to Lynchburg Write if you get the money and
        the box. I sent you more this time.<br></big></big>
