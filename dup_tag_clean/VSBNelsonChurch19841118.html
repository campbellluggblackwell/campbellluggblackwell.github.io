        <span style="font-style: italic;">[Below is a transcription of what
        apparently was an insert for the Order of Service for the Nelson
        Community Church --- or possibly a transcription from the original. The
        copy I typed this from bore the inscription "Tho't maybe you'd like to
        know this!" I'm not sure who sent it to me, perhaps Cousin Ande RICE
        Tubbs. The reason it would have interested me that it mentions: my ggf,
        Rev. Henry Goodrich, who was pastor there when it was a Methodist
        Church before the building was moved from the South Side; my
        grandmother, Frances GOODRICH Hoyt; and my mother's 1st cousin, Ruth
        TUBBS Krise. It also mentions Campbell (also Lugg) Cousin Burton R.
        Rice, his wife, Clairbel BOYCE Rice, and their children: Eileen RICE
        Shepherd Harris, Dortha RICE Davenport, & Robert W. Rice. Moreover, it
        also mentions a group of our Blackwell Cousins (that particular branch
        also being Luggs).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- Transcribed and annotated Feb

      2. There were so many people named "Enoch Blackwell" that it makes it
      hard to be sure which ones are being referred to if no middle name is
      given.There also are many "Mary Blackwell"s and several "Caroline
      Blackwell"s. Where no middle name is given, I have guessed at which
      seemed most likely --- wbt.</span>
