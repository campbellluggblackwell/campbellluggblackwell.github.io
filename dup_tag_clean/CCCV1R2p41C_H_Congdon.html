          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will
          Selph</a> has requested me to give an account of my western trip
          which extended along the Pacific Coast practically from Old Mexico to
          Canada. I have hundreds of friends in that part of the country and my
          visit was one continuous round of joyful re‑unions. Many of these
          friends I had known forty-five years ago. Some of them have attained
          high places in business and the various professions.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. W. Frater, formerly of Brainerd, Minn., is
          now Judge of the Superior Court at Seattle; Frank Hartley runs the
          largest shingle mill in the world. The capacity‑of this mill is one
          million two hundred fifty thousand shingles per day. The recent
          enormous orders for lumber from Japan will undoubtedly fall into his
          hands.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David Clough, an old friend of mine and
          formerly Governor of Minnesota, is associated with the Hartleys in
          the lumber industry. They operate several large mills.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland Hartley, son‑in‑law of Governor Clough
          and brother of Frank, is a candidate for Governor of Washington.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took brother <a href=
          "CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a> with me on this trip and he stuck to
          me even closer than a brother. We visited the Hartleys and many other
          old Brainerd friends. We stayed all night with Frank and took lunch
          with Mrs. Roland Hartley. Roland himself was away campaigning. Mrs.
          Westfall, another Brainerdite, was present at this luncheon.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my way from Santa Barbara to San
          Francisco, I stopped off at San Jose to visit W.W. Hartley. I found
          him at Mountain View and, of course, spent the night at his home. He
          used to be editor of the Brainerd Tribune, and was also postmaster
          there.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed and I never had such a splendid visit
          together before. In a letter I received from him yesterday he says:
          "You certainly had a wonderful trip. We all enjoyed your visit,‑ I
          can't tell you how much. It has been many years since we had such a
          good visit together. We live it over and over in our memory." This
          was true of <a href="VaughanEmma1854.html">Em</a> and <span wc_id=
          "I947">Lee</span> and <span wc_id="I941">Georgia</span>.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The grandest trip we took was up Mt. Tacoma
          or "Rainier" as it is called in the geography. It is the "Mountain
          that is God". While I saw Mount Shasta for nearly a whole day as I
          took the Shasta Route from San Francisco to Portland, and also
          several</font></font>

          this marvellous <span style="font-style: italic;">[sic]</span>
          mountain whose foothills cover several counties and whose snow‑capped
          peak rises fourteen thousand five hundred feet above the sea. It
          stands like a sentinel to the pearly gates. One is lifted far above
          the lowly plains of earth almost into the presence of the Creator.
          Nothing moves me to worship like this wonderful mountain. I came away
          feeling that my soul had been refreshed for I had drunk from the
          living streams that flow from "The Mountain that is God".<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not impose on you by going into
          unnecessary detail, but I feel that I could write all day on this
          most inspiring theme.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you have all heard from Ed and Em and
          their children from time to time, I will not attempt to relate all
          the pleasant things that occurred while I was there. Em is a good
          scout and entered into our pleasures with zest and keen
          appreciation.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Georgia lives across the sound from Seattle.
          They have a nice home at a little place called Harper. Oscar has a
          good position with the Alaska Steamship Company. This connection has
          afforded them frequent trips to Alaska. Georgia is very capable and
          enterprising. She makes big money raising flowers and marketing them
          in Seattle. Lee is in the real estate business at Tacoma. and is
          doing well. Most of you saw Helen, his wife, at the last Cousins'
          Dinner. They have two unusually bright children, Edgar and Elizabeth.
          Edgar is a prodigy on the violin. He will make a national reputation
          if permitted to pursue his studies. He is only fifteen years old and
          plays like a virtuoso.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Educational Association met in
          San Francisco and Oakland, across the bay. There I met the leading
          educators of the country. <span wc_id="I961">Anna</span> was with me
          during these meetings and enjoyed them immensely. I was honored by
          having my songs sung at one of the important meetings and was invited
          to lead the singing.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the cities I visited on this trip were
          Long Beach, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, San Jose, San Francisco,
          Oakland, Berkeley, Sacramento, Placerville, Portland (Ore.), Tacoma,
          Seattle and Everett (Wash.), and other smaller places.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anna and the girls are at Santa Barbara,

          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We pursued the setting sun and, later, the
          new moon until they both sank into the 'dark and deep blue ocean';‑
          but the next morning the sun peeped apologetically over the Coast
          Range, apparently none the worse for his nocturnal escapade."<br>

        new moon resembled a bent safety razor blade, but what a tremendous
        load she pulls. The tides have a potential force that would, if
        converted into electricity, heat and light every home and turn every
        wheel in the whole world.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many cities in California, and more
        especially in Santa Barbara, one is impressed by the Spanish names and
        the Spanish styles of architecture. A very large percentage of the
        residences are only one story high but no two are alike in the same
        locality.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many Catholic missions here. The
        Indians and primitive people were the easiest to convert, but the
        "civilized heathens” wiped out these beautiful traditions, leaving only
        architectural relics of the Spanish regime. The missions are valuable
        however for advertising this land of plenty, where "Fleecy flocks the
        hills adorn, with valleys filled with gravy corn." But these valleys
        are more noted for their vast orchards of apples and oranges.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can look out on the ocean from our cottage
        in Santa Barbara. Three islands extend southward. The channel
        separating them from the mainland is thirty miles wide but it does not
        look to be over five. I hear voices of strange birds here, but none
        more sweet than the robin or the bluebird whose songs were familiar to
        me in childhood.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nights are invariably cool but it gets hot
        in the middle of the day. There are no thunder showers out here to
        shudder at.</font></font>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving California for the north, I
          took a side trip from Sacramento to the top of the Sierra Nevada
          Range. It was so interesting that I would not consider this letter
          complete without giving a brief account of it.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in every other city I visited, I found a
          number of old friends in Sacramento. I called on the State
          Superintendent of Public Instruction and then took the train eastward
          to Placerville. This is a famous gold mining town that has a very
          interesting history.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the older Cousins will remember "Zade
          and Georgia” Congdon, who left Nelson with their parents in 1860 to
          cast their lot in California. They settled in Placerville., where
          Aunt "Emmie's" father lived. Uncle George, the girl's father, was not
          a success in business but he could fiddle almost as well as <a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_Bull">Ole Bull</a>. He made lots of
          money playing for dances, receiving usually twenty‑five dollars a
          night.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls grew up with two other children,
          all of whom were married in due time. But Georgia developed into a
          beautiful singer. This put her into the best society and she married
          a man worth half a million dollars. He was a brother of William C.
          Ralston of San Francisco, who was at one time worth many millions. He
          built the celebrated Palace Hotel of San Francisco which was
          destroyed by fire at the time of the earthquake there. The Ralston
          brothers lost the bulk of their fortunes and William drowned himself
          on the beach near San Francisco. Thomas, Georgia's husband, saved a
          large tract of land in Iowa which is now quite valuable and will keep
          Georgia in good circumstances the rest of her life. Of course, "Zade"
          will be well provided for.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dropped off at Placerville which is the end
          of that line of railroad and after some inquiry found these two old
          dames sitting on the front porch of one of a row of cottages which
          Georgia owns. You can imagine their surprise.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Georgia's daughter, Stella, married a shoe
          merchant of that place and as this was Saturday he drove us all up
          the gulch about forty miles where they have a summer cottage. We
          stayed over Sunday among trees that measure from six to eight feet in
          diameter and tower to a height of over one hundred feet. These are
          not the celebrated big trees of California which have a diameter of
          thirty feet. Their cottage is surrounded with sleeping porches so
          that when an occasion requires they can entertain a dozen guests or
          more. Sunday we drove on to the top of the Sierra Nevada range where
          we could look over into the state of Nevada and also get a good view
          of Lake Tahoe, which is a very beautiful lake situated in California
          near its eastern border.</font></font>

          surpassed by any of the wonderful scenes I beheld except of course,
          Mt. Ranier, which I have already described.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road from Placerville to the top of this
          range was the old pioneer trail over which thousands of pioneers
          travelled to the golden state as far back as 1849. This trail is now
          a part of the <a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Highway">Lincoln Highway</a>
          which is being pushed rapidly to completion.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a stage driver in the early days by
          the name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Monk">Hank
          Monk</a>. He was a fearless driver of marvellous skill. With one
          "jerk line" he would guide a team of six horses at break‑neck speed,
          often running within a foot of precipices a thousand feet to the
          bottom. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Greeley">Horace
          Greeley</a> rode with Monk many years ago and I remember a cartoon in
          one of the New York papers representing Greeley frightened almost to
          death and stinking his head out of the stage window trying
          frantically to get out. Georgia said she had ridden with Monk several
          times.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zade and Georgia have a brother Ed who lives
          in Oakland. He has a position with the Southern Pacific Railroad in
          their offices at San Francisco. When I called on him there, of
          course, he did not know me. I said: "It is strange you do not
          recognize me,‑ I used to knew you sixty‑three years ago back in
          Pennsylvania; furthermore, you are my cousin."<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zade and Georgia are now old women. It was
          interesting to hear them relate their experiences when Georgia was
          the prima donna of the Pacific Coast. Alzada was a good singer and
          both moved in the wealthiest circles of California. Now they are
          serenely waiting for the summons to join that endless caravan that is
          moving slowly and silently along the final trail, toward the setting
          sun.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stopped at Portland, Oregon, and visited
          several old friends. I went out to Gresham only a few miles from
          Portland and stayed all night with Will Congdon, Tom's brother. We
          visited the County Fair, bought lemonade and had a most enjoyable
          time. Will is a prominent citizen of Gresham.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must now leave this interesting country. I
          do so very reluctantly for as I have said, this has been the most
          wonderful tour of my life.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed and family took me to the station at
          Tacoma and after a tearful parting, I was soon rolling eastward in a
          modern sleeper attached to a Northern Pacific train.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stopped first at Spokane and saw several
          old friends I used to know in Brainerd, Minnesota. I received the
          same cordial warm‑hearted greeting that had characterized my entire
          trip</font></font>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Helena, Montana, I stopped off on purpose
          to see Governor Dixon, who was Chairman of the National Committee of
          the Progressive Party during the Campaign of 1912. He was then United
          States Senator from Montana. He invited me into the Executive Chamber
          of the Capitol and we chatted for more than an hour recalling the
          experiences of that wonderful campaign. He spoke of the tidal wave of
          song that poured forth from fifteen thousand throats at the
          Progressive Convention in Chicago and the manner in which I led them,
          using the Chicago Tribune rolled up to serve as a baton.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next stop was Valley City, N.D., where I
          stayed all night in order to take a local train for Mapleton where
          Mate Congdon Shaver, sister of Tom Congdon, lives. She and her
          husband, Henry Shaver, drove me to Fargo where I met other relatives
          and friends. I had the extreme pleasure of spending the evening with
          Rev. R. A. Beard, my pastor at Brainerd, Minn. forty years ago. It
          was a most delightful re‑union. I also met Charlie Saran, who married
          Sarah Congdon, Uncle Alfred Congdon's daughter. Sate is dead and
          Charlie is a retired locomotive engineer. He used to pull those great
          overland trains on the Northern Pacific Railroad between Brainerd and
          Fargo.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not stop at Brainerd to see <a href=
          "BixbyHannah1863.html">Hannah Hughey</a> and her children because I
          was overdue in New York, but I stopped off a day in St. Paul where I
          had spent twelve fruitful years and where our children were born. My
          next stop was Chicago, then Watkins., N. Y. <span style=

          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now back in the whirl of business, but
          the memory of this eventful trip will abide with me to the end of my
          life.<br>
