        Dear Campbell Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        So many things have happened since last April, that I hardly know here
        I should begin.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am writing from a brand new address this time; for, as you all know I
        was married November twenty-eighth, 1925, and my new home is in
        Morristown.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;Morristown is a very historical place, dating back to the time of
        George Washington. We have here an official George Washington's
        Headquarters which contains many interesting relics of Revolutionary
        times,- as some of the Cousins know who have visited this spot with us.
        The winter when Washington was located here was comparable to the one
        spent at Valley Forge; - it was so severe, The women from all the
        surrounding country towns knitting socks for soldiers as their bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides being historical Morristown, as a modern town, is not only a
        beautiful place but an interesting and busy one in which to live. It is
        just far enough outside of New Your City, - thirty miles - to offer
        attractions of its own. There are splendid concerts and lectures and
        entertainments of all sorts and good "Movies" to attend. There are five
        Protestant churches (I am now a member of the Methodist Episcopal
        church here) = and a fine library; so one's interests may be many and
        varied.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some beautiful estates in Morristown, located on the older
        streets, which give a certain fine character and prestige to the place
        Thee are also many newer streets with modern houses. Our home is
        located on one of the latter and we are certainly very, very happy in
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am the proud possessor of a couple of beautiful quilts which have
        come to me from certain members of my Campbell relations. One was sent
        to me when I was but five years old and had been put away until such a
        time as this. It was made by Aunt <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Jane
        Tubbs</a> when she was about seventy-five years old, and is the
        <a href="http://www.generations-quilt-patterns.com/log-cabin-quilt-designs.html">
        Log Cabin pattern</a> with a great deal of pink and black in it, so is
        is in my pink quest room. My blue guest room boasts the other coverlet
        which Cousins <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Anna Owlett</a> and
        <a href="LoopStella1863.html">Stella Wilbur</a> made for me for a
        wedding present. It was copied from a piece of quilt found in the
        mansion at Mount Vernon.

        Mentioning Mount Vernon takes me back in thought to Washington, D. C.
        which was the destination of our wedding trip. We stayed with the
        Snavelys where both <span wc_id="I1606">Philip</span> and I enjoyed
        ourselves immensley <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>. <span wc_id=
        "I1050">Cousin Mary</span> said that of all the people who have visited
        her we saw the most in our week's time. We feel that our trip is well
        worth remembering all our lives. Never before had either of us seen
        such fine buildings and institutions of National interest. I imagine it
        is particularly lovely there just now with the cherry blossoms in
        bloom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last year, at the close of college in June, I went with the Wheaton
        College delegation to the Y.W.C.A. Conference of the Eastern Women's
        Colleges held at Silver Bay on Lake George<sup>1</sup>. There were
        about seven hundred of us all told so you can imagine what a fine
        opportunity we had to become acquainted with new people. The general
        topics under discussion at the conference were: Education, Citizenship
        and Personal Betterment. We listened to very inspirational speakers at
        these meetings. Some of us had never visited Lake George and we were
        charmed with it. The scenery was most beautiful, with the green wooded
        mountains sloping down into the water. The side trip up to Fort
        Ticonderoga was most interesting and the hike we took up Black
        Mountain, the highest point on Lake George, - with a picnic supper at
        the close was surely a good one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quite naturally, the short time which elapsed between my homecoming at
        the end of June and my marriage in November was extra busy; for in the
        summer on is apt to take time for visiting and entertaining. Then, too,
        we attended the Cousins Dinner in October, - my first, - where we
        certainly enjoyed ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Philip, my husband, joins in wishing all our Cousins good health and a
        prosperous year, - for I imagine that length of time will pass before
        we shall hear from some of you again.
      </p>

      Most sincerely yours,

        1. In the 1970s I attended a conference at that facility and was able
        to bring my wife and children. Somewhat rustic, but every bit as
        beautiful as Doris says.
