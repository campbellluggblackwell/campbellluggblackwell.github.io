        Since 2014, our reunions have been held every other year, on the first
        Saturday of August, in even numbered years. Last year's reunion was
        held Sat., Aug 1, 2020. But because of the COVID-19 pandemic, for the
        first time, instead of being held in person, we did it by televideo --
        via ZOOM.
      </p>
      <p>
        We missed the comradery of meeting in person, and the pleasure of
        sharing a pot luck meal. BUT, it provided an opportunity for many to
        join us for the first time. Cost, travel time, being a caregiver to
        others, infirmities of age, etc. instantly faded. For instance, a
        cousin joined us from a remote part of British Columbia who would not
        have come to Nelson. Perhaps cousins from other countries may decide to
        participate in the future -- no Visa & passport needed. Nor airfare,
        hotels, meals, etc. (I met one of our English cousins years ago -- it
        would be great to meet more.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the logistics of holding Zoom reunions are easier to arrange
        than for in-person gatherings, we may hold one this year. If so, it
        will be via ZOOM (or a similar product). It's too soon to know, but
        depending on the course of the pandemic, it may be possible to have an
        a single, in-person event in our near Nelson -- or perhaps a number of
        small gatherings, all over the country -- all connected via ZOOM (or
        the equivalent). People are getting vaccinated at an increasing rate
        --- an encouraging sign of getting the pandemic under control. But the
        virus is mutating and new strains are more contagious. Hospitalization
        rates and daily deaths remain high. And many people are afraid of
        vaccines. So, we'll "play it by ear" and make decisions as a clearer
        picture unfolds.
