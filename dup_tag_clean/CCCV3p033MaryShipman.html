        My dear Cousins and all:

    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Another year has passed, and we are again reminded by our worthy
        officers that it is time for our annual letters. I haven't forgotten
        it, for I have been looking forward for some time to the wonderful
        messages we are soon to receive. Still, at this time I wish I might
        enjoy them, without doing my bit. However, I find there is nothing
        worthwhile gained without some effort on our part; and since I I have
        been ill and in my room for nearly nine months, and most of that time
        in my bed, and since I have spent many pleasant hours reading those
        letters and looking into the faces of those we love, I know it's well
        worth the effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been with <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel</a> and
        <span wc_id="I773">Llewellyn</span> since June first. I have the best
        room in the house, and every comfort possible. <span wc_id=
        "I780">Helen</span> and the boys are just across the street, and I see
        them every day. I now sit up each afternoon and have been out in the
        car a number of times, so you see I have very much for which to be
        thankful. I almost thought during the winter that I was in Florida. My
        room always had flowers. <a href="CampbellWilliam1864.html">Brother
        Will</a> from the North kept the temperature just right with electric
        pads, etc., while <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a> has kept
        delicious Florida fruit on my table all winter. Another large lovely
        box came only last week.
      </p>
      <p>
        I miss sister <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Kate</a> who was with me
        often until she and <span wc_id="I787">Lish</span> went South. I hope
        the weather will be so hot that we shall see them home soon. We enjoyed
        a visit in August from Brother Will and <span wc_id=
        "I905">Louise</span>, Tommie and <a href=
        "ParksFrances1855.html">Frank</a>. Kate and Lish and, a little later,
        Cousin <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a> and <a href=
        "VaughanEmma1854.html">Emma Congdon</a>; so, if I could not attend our
        real Cousins Dinner, which I so much regretted, we did have quite a
        reunion right here in my room, and I certainly did enjoy it. Kate sent
        me a report of the dinner at Cousin <span wc_id="I1057">Laura
        Mowrey</span>'s, and <a href="LoopStella1863.html">Stella Wilbur</a>
        was kind enough to report on the one at Cousin <a href=
        "CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie Congdon</a>'s, together with a fine
        account of her trip. Cousin <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Ann
        Owlett</a> was with me several weeks during the summer, and if any of
        you need a nurse, and want assistance in locating one, I can recommend
        a "top liner".
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the one hundred cards and letters which I received at Christmas
        time, I had remembrances from sixteen of our cousins. They helped
        wonderfully to make the days shorter and brighter.

        Three of our cousins have passed away<sup>1</sup> since our last
        correspondence and exchange of letters, and we can truly sympathize
        with their loved ones, and deeply feel the loss ourselves. We shall
        miss their letters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cousin <span wc_id="I1448">Ross Van Dusen</span> spoke of his busy
        life<sup>2</sup>, and <a href="CraneJennie1852.html">Cousin Jennie</a>
        of so many things we older cousins remember<sup>3</sup>. When
        <span wc_id="I771">George</span> and I were married, Christmas
        1873<sup>4</sup>, Cousins <span wc_id="I1048">Johnnie</span> and Jennie
        Bosard and <a href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">Mark</a> and <span wc_id=
        "I973">Sue Seely</span> and Ed and Emma Congdon were there, and each of
        the three babies then only a few months old, and of whom Jennie
        spoke<sup>5</sup>, has a letter in our last year's C.C.C.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like Roswell, I think a large family is fine - nothing gave our
        children more pleasure than going to <a href=
        "ClinchAnn1804.html">Grandma Campbell</a>'s where we were always
        welcome, and we all loved every last one of our eleven aunts and
        uncles. This is why our large family of cousins seem so near. I feel
        sorry for the children today who have only one brother or sister, with
        aunts and uncles equally scarce, and who are so far separated from them
        that they have little more than a speaking acquaintance. Of course,
        such unfortunate children will never know that they have missed, but
        most of our cousins could tell them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope through the wonderful idea and plan of Cousin <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> we shall always keep in touch
        with the descendants of our forbears and live up to the principles
        taught by those good old Scotch and English ancestors.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the girls<sup>6</sup> intend to write, I shall let them tell how
        busy they are themselves, and shall get my letter on its way, as I
        should hate to be the very last in line.
      </p>
      <p>
        With best wishes for the coming year, and much love to you all.

        4. Our "modern", commercialized Xmas --- family time together and a
        fat, jolly Santa are less than a 100 years old. Those customs and
        imagery weren't nationwide till about 1920. Puritans outlawed
        celebrating Xmas; and in the North, celebrating it was widely
        considered sinful until after the Civil War. Weddings on Xmas were
        quite common in the 1800s and even into the early 1900s.
