      <p>
        Dear Cousins One and All:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        We have been notified by our very efficient officers that it is time
        for the annual Cousins letter. It is a beautiful morning, -- the sun is
        shining, birds singing, sap running, and we have every evidence that
        spring is here. We have lived through another winter without any
        serious trouble and are looking forward to the garden, flowers, and
        most important, our children and our friends can get to visit us more
        often. Shall look for <span wc_id="I1595">Treva</span> and her family
        at Easter time and <a href="HookerEva1885.html">Eva</a> will come about
        May 1st.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Just at present the roads are almost impassable<sup>1</sup>. Nelson has
        been moving, -- a Springtime pleasure,-- but with very good results.
        Where we used to have seven Campbell families on this side<sup>2</sup>
        of the river, we have that many good Farmington <span class=
        "Annotation">[Township - wbt]</span> families now, who are a great help
        to the Church and town, and several more across the river, -- while
        there is just one left who can claim the name of Campbell and that is
        <span wc_id="I1615">Ida Campbell</span> Eaton.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to say that <span wc_id="I1532">Clifford Young</span> need not
        think that the pleasure was all on his side, while he was preaching to
        us that summer, for we enjoyed having him with us, especially in the
        pulpit of the Church<sup>3</sup>, -- that is sacred in the eyes of the
        Campbell family. We have a very efficient man here at present, -- the
        Rev. F. B. McFeely.
      </p>
      <p>
        As usual, Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a> picked
        the right ones to be the officers of this Correspondence Club and we
        are very fortunate to have so many able ones among out numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie Congdon</a> made me a visit
        recently, -- we always enjoy his visits.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will all be glad that Mr. and Mrs. <span wc_id="I986">O. B.
        Blanchard</span> are living in <a href="CampbellJoseph1839.html">Uncle
        Joe</a>'s house. It was so dismal up there while the house was vacant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Will just say in closing that I am quite likely to be "At home" all
        summer and hope that none of you will forget where I live for I shall
        be very glad to see you.
