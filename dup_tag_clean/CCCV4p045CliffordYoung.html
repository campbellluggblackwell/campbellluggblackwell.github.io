        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        My letter to you this time has two parts; viz. concerning my family,
        and concerning my work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, <span wc_id="I1533">Martha</span> and I have a daughter
        <span wc_id="I1534">Jane Young</span>, who is eight months old. She has
        four teeth, weighs eighteen pounds and in most respects is precocious,
        - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we</span> think. We have
        had to run the establishment without help, - no mothers-in-law or
        relatives, and it has been a busy eight months, you can well believe,
        especially the first three. By force of circumstances I have had to
        become about as efficient a nurse as my wife. I wouldn't have missed it
        all for anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, concerning my work. Since my summer as student preacher in
        Nelson and Tioga<sup>1</sup>, I know that some of you will be
        interested. We are about to build a new church building. The building
        that we are now using is about sixteen years old, and because of the
        rapid growth of the neighborhood we are in, we must have something
        bigger and better. We had our financial campaign in January and raise
        $27,500, the first day. That has since been increased t around $34,000.
        We expect to proceed as soon as the details have been worked out with
        an architect, - to break ground and put up a $50,000 edifice, counting
        on the balance of the money to come from another drive at dedication
        time. It is mighty interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have one "luxury", a second-hand Ford Sedan, which was given to us
        by the men in my congregation to increase my efficiency as a pastor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hoping to see some of you this summer, I remain,
      </p>

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>
        1. In the summer of 1921. See his 1923 <a href=
        "http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Ecapane/CCCV1R2p64CliffordYoung.html">
        letter</a>.

        2. Adjusted for inflation, a dollar in 1926 had about the same
        purchasing power as $13 in 2013.
