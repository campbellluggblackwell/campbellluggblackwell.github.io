        Dear Campbell Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Regardless of all my good intentions, I have waited longer than I
        intended before having this annual visit with you. So much has come
        into the lives of many of our circle since our last issue that I am
        waiting with much interest for the messages which will soon be ours to
        enjoy As <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin William</a> has asked
        us especially to mention the small as well as the greater experiences
        we have had during the year we certainly each must have a message.
        <span wc_id="I787">Lish</span> and myself returned from the Southland
        soon after my last letter - and we were a very busy pair for a time -
        adjusting ourselves to the very strenuous duties of house cleaning,
        gardening, etc. And after <span style=
        "text-decoration: underline;">that</span> -- enjoying our home and
        friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was our privilege to attend the Campbell Reunion in August -
        motoring there with <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a> and
        <a href="ParksFrances1855.html">Frank</a>, who were at that time
        visiting friends in the North. To me it seemed one of the most
        enjoyable in many years, but we missed many faces that had greeted us
        in years past. Very soon after this we were called to Nelson to attend
        the funeral of Brother <span wc_id="I836">Will Ellison</span>, whose
        sudden going away was a great shock to all of us, and our sympathy went
        out to his family. The funeral was held in the Presbyterian Church, a
        place very sacred to us all, on account of early associations. I
        wandered back to the seat my <a href=
        "CampbellWilliam1822.html">father</a> and <span wc_id=
        "I767">mother</span> and us children occupied together, Oh, so long
        ago, and paused in reverence - my mind was so filled with past
        memories. We went home with sister <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">Mary
        Shipman</a> that night as she was not well and we were very anxious
        over her condition. Soon after she had a most serious operation, and
        how grateful we all are that she is quite well again and enjoying
        another winter with Tommie and Frank in Florida.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next big event was the annual Cousins Dinner at the home of Cousins
        <span wc_id="I1470">Will</span> and <a href=
        "TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie Clark</a>, in Osceola, Pa. It was a most
        joyous occasion - many Cousins coming a long distance to be present and
        others even closing up their business places to enjoy the occasion.
        Cousin <span wc_id="I1605">Doris Selph</span> who was so soon to change
        her name looked very happy and we enjoyed her so much, but we missed
        many faces whose presence would have gladdened our hearts.
        Brother<span class="Annotation">[s]</span> <a href=
        "CampbellWilliam1864.html">Will</a> and Tommie and sister Mary, were
        all spoken of, as well as others who were missed.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think most of you know that we were called here in November, 1925, on
        account of the serious illness of <span wc_id=
        "I815">Nellie</span>,-making the journey in five days, with a change of
        trains once - which was in Chicago<sup>1</sup>. She was very ill for
        many weeks, but thanks to a kind Providence she was spared to us, and
        is now quite herself again. Since her recovery
      </p>

        1. At that time it was not possible to travel thru Chicago by train
        from West to East (or East to West) without changing trains.

        we have been having a most delightful time at <span wc_id=
        "I828">Arthur</span>'s - <span wc_id="I790">Frank</span>'s and here
        with <span wc_id="I816">Clark</span> and Nellie. The climate in some
        respects is much like Florida - vegetation grows and flowers bloom all
        during the winter months. There has been no snow here this winter, but
        at all times we can see the snow capped peaks of many mountains, Mount
        Hood, Mt. Jefferson and others. The past week Clark, Nellie, Lish and I
        motored to Newport, a popular winter resort on the Pacific coast, near
        here where people were enjoying surf bathing and the sun was so hot we
        found a shady corner to watch the white caps on the Pacific Ocean. We
        spent several weeks at FrankY's home in Portland, which was a wonderful
        privilege, From there I had a most delightful trip to Tacoma and spent
        a week at the home of Cousins <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a>
        and <a href="VaughanEmma1854.html">Em Congdon</a>, a privilege I had
        long coveted. The trip was one never to be forgotten for the scenery.
        The broad Columbia River, the immense lumbering districts - covering
        acres of ground and the waters of Puget Sound, dotted with large
        sea-faring vessels, with Mount Ranier snow capped in the distance, --
        made a picture long to be remembered. But the best was yet to come, -
        Cousin Ed and his son, <span wc_id="I947">Lee</span>, a fine Cousin
        whom you would lie to know, met us at the station and we drove to his
        home where Cousin Em stood ready to welcome us. Nothing which could add
        to the to the pleasure f my visit was left undone. One of the pleasant
        events was a one o'clock luncheon given by Cousin Em in honor of my
        birthday, February 25th. A large number of her friends were invited and
        her daughter, <span wc_id="I941">Georgia</span> and <span wc_id=
        "I942">husband</span> came all the way from Harper, Washington, to be
        present. I returned to Portland for a time - then back here to
        Independence, to find that during my absence a darling little girl,
        <span wc_id="I830">Dora Grace</span> - had come to gladden the hearts
        and home of Arthur - a beautiful child - which we trust may be a great
        comfort to them.

        <span wc_id="I820">Faith</span> is home from college for her Easter
        vacation, a most interesting girl - full of college life and
        enthusiastic over her work<sup>2</sup>. We have missed her in the home.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sad news has just reached us of Cousin <a href=
        "YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil Young</a>'s untimely death, and has cast a
        gloom over us. We remember him best when he and <span wc_id=
        "I1493">Cousin Lou</span> - who was a favorite of us all - came often
        to <a href="CampbellJohn1836.html">Uncle John</a>'s with their children
        to enjoy family gatherings. Our deepest sympathy goes out to each
        member of his family. We will miss him from our circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will leave here very soon, for Baker, 300 miles toward
        home<sup>3</sup> and spend several weeks at <span wc_id=
        "I822">Harry</span>'s home. This will be another pleasure - then we
        must hike for home, and get busy after a delightful winter spent in the
        homes of our children, each one of whom joins us in sending love to all
        the Campbell Cousins.
