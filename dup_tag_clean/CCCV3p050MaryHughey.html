        Dear Campbell Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        It hardly seems a year since our last "get-together". How time flies!
        The heading on this letter will tell you where I am located, but is so
        happens that the body of this letter is being written under the pines
        where the Hughey latch string hangs out<sup>1</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love Minneapolis, although I am far too busy to fully appreciate it
        by "taking in" the many good things which come along. I am teaching in
        the Edith Cavell School, located at Thirty-fourth Avenue and Filmore
        Street, N.E., far enough from the business district so that the air is
        pure and the birds are our neighbors. I am living at the dormitories of
        the Northwestern Bible and Missionary Training School, right across
        from Loring Park, one block from Hennepin Avenue. Some of you will know
        where that is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last fall I was delighted by a good visit with <a href=
        "CongdonCharles1856.html">Cousin Charlie</a>. We met at
        M.E.A.<sup>2</sup> It so happened that <a href=
        "BixbyHannah1863.html">mother</a> came down that week-end, so she too,
        had the pleasure of seeing him. I tell you I was some proud to be
        promenading around with C.H. Congdon of "Who's Who in
        America"!<sup>3</sup> Surely some of you will be passing through
        Minneapolis within the next year. If you do, please look me up. I may
        be there this summer attending summer school at the University.
      </p>My heart goes out in sympathy to the bereaved cousins. May he whose
      love passeth all understanding comfort and sustain them.
      <p>
        I am having such a blessed experience this year by living with the
        Bible students. Northwestern has a fine lot of young people, and it is
        a great privilege to me to be with them. I was glad when I learned that
        they let one building to "outsiders".
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope this doesn't sound like too much of an "I" letter<sup>4</sup>.
        It is hard to get away from it in this correspondence, I find.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been wondering if we could not at some future time compile
        special groups of letters. One group, for instance, might be made up of
        general reminiscences, another of family jokes, another of short
        autobiographies and biographies of those who have left the circle, and
        the like<sup>5</sup>.

        1. Pioneer cabins did not have door nobs or locks. On the inside, there
        was a short bar, permanently fastened at one end, so that it could
        pivot. The other end was free to fall into a slot built to hold it
        securely and prevent someone outside from opening the door. In order to
        get back in when one left the house, a string was tied to the pivoting
        bar, and left hanging outside. To get back in the house, you jut lifted
        the latch string..
      </p>

        2. Minnesota Education Association, a teachers organization. Charley
        came from NYC to see old friends from his days teaching in Brainerd, MN
        and supervising vocal music in St Paul. And perhaps to sell some of the
        music text books he published.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. If you click on the link for Charlie, it takes you to his mini-bio
        --- which contains his <span style="font-style: italic;">Who's
        Who</span> entry.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. A letter consisting of "I did ..."; "I think ..."; "I want ...";
        etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. To the best of knowledge, this web site is the first time Mary's
        wish was implemented. We may never get around to having web pages
        dedicated to jokes, but we do have pages for "<a href=
        "http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Ecapane/MiniBioIndex01.html">short
        autobiographies and biographies</a>." Mary wrote a longish
        autobiography that she titled <span style="font-style: italic;">The
        Story of My Life</span>. Memoirs often illustrate how the writer wished
        to be remembered, not objective history. Mary's sharp tongued niece,
        Irma, described Mary's memoir as "the story of the life she wished
        she'd lived." Perhaps that's the case for most autobiographies. Roger
        Hughey kindly gave me a copy, so perhaps one day <span style=
        "font-style: italic;">The Story of My Life</span> will be added to this
        web site..

        Perhaps <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a> already has
        some such plan in his head. I just wrote this because it "popped into
        my head" as I sat here with my pen poised. I've been interested in the
        poetry of one kind and another that has appeared in our book. Sometimes
        I get literary longings and attempt to express them, but you'd laugh at
        some of them. Here's a short - I don't know what to call it, suggested
        to me by the "back East" expressions<sup>6</sup> of my <span wc_id=
        "I1202">Grandfather</span> and <span wc_id="I1203">Grandmother
        Bixby</span>. I wrote this two or three summers ago, and this looks
        like a chance to get it into print.

        A STORM<br>
        <br>
        There's a black cloud in the west,<br>
        Big drops begin to fall,<br>
        This wind has picked a board from off<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our shed,<br>
        The hens go by with huddled wings;<br>
        Grandma looks anxious, but<br>
        Grandpa, reassured, looks overhead.<br>
        "Jest a mere squall, the clouds are<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; partin'.<br>
        "Shet that south winder", was all he<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please forgive such an intrusion. It's just to show you that at least
        I've tried, and that's what is expected of a Campbell, isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, I'm "pal-ing" some with a girl named Vera Campbell, but we
        haven't been able to trace a family connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you come to Minneapolis, call Main 5278 and ask for me, or, if you
        come before June twelfth, you can reach me at the Cavell School.

        considered "Eastern" expressions.
