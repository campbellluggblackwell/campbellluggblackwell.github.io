      [This letter from Lillian LOSEY Preston (1893 - 1973) of Nelson, PA to
      her lifelong friend, <a href=
      "http://wc.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1250">
      Jessica HOYT</a> Thompson, in Binghamton, NY has a vivid description of
      the 1972 flooding from Hurricane Agnes. Lill was a daughter of James
      Taggert Losey (1843 - 1911). He operated the mill that was originally
      built by <a href="CampbellJohn1761.html">John Campbell</a> (the elder)
      and inherited by <a href="BlackwellEnoch1814.html">Enoch Blackwell</a>
      (the younger). James was the brother of <a href=
      "http://wc.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I973">
      Susan LOSEY</a> Seely. Lill's nephew, Capt. <a href=
      "ClipRobtMLoseyObit.html">Robert M. Losey</a> (1908 - 1940), was the 1st
      American casualty of WW2. Lill grew up in Nelson, but spent most of her
      adult live in NYC working for AT&amp;T. After retirement she returned to
      Nelson and married Harry Watrous Preston (1873 - 1961). She bought one of
      the Losey family homes -- on the lane on the South Side, spent a lot of
      money fixing it up and was very proud of her roses. So, the flood damage
      was a severe blow.

        1. Hurricane Agnes cause the most destructive flooding in PA history as
        of that date. More than 68,000 homes were destroyed, 128 deaths and
        about $3 billion in damage.The US Weather Service "retired" the name
        "Agnes" for hurricanes. I vividly remember when the rains hit. I was
        living a few miles from Binghamton, NY, moving from one house to
        another. Loading and unloading a moving van in the downpour was a
        challenge. Both homes were near the Susquehanna River. Water was coming
        into the cellar of the one house as we moved the last of the boxes out.
        And up to the front lawn of the other when we arrived to unload. An
        inconvenience, but insignificant compared to the tragedy that many
        experienced. See <a href="https://www.weather.gov/ctp/Agnes">Hurricane
        Agnes details</a>.

        new elec. blowers. It is a bad job with a damp cellar and no heat since
        June 23rd. I had a safe deposit box in L.<sup>2</sup> and that got
        flooded and everything had to be dried out. Some of those papers like
        deeds were old and I was afraid that the paper would crack. But the old
        papers were better than some of the new ones. My will was hardly
        readable. As you know, <a href=

        bushes. Both my vegetable and flower gardens were ruined. I have just
        had 5 truck loads of top soil put in, 3 in the vegetable and 2 in the
        flower gardens. There were a few days that we felt very much isolated
        here in Nelson. The bridge about the house both abutments were damaged
        and the bridge was closed to traffic for weeks. The Army Engineers that
        had been working on the Tioga and Hammond dams were working with all
        their equipment on the bridge above the house. They struck quick sand
        and 15' of water around the abutments. Lawrenceville was flooded. No

        in only last week. It was at the exchange in L. guess the telephone
        exchange still is a problem in L. I feel wicked when I complain and see
        what the flood did in L. There wasn't a place in L. that wasn't
        flooded. Agnes<sup>3</sup> and Rex<sup>4</sup> had 23" of water in the
        first floor of their home I guess that they lost most everything in the
        first floor. Betty<sup>5</sup> their married daughter, I guess they
        lost everything only the house wasn't condemned but the household goods
        was flooded. They lived in Gang Mills N.Y. Bakers<sup>6</sup> & the

        But I have most of my bills paid and still money in the bank to live on
        for the rest of the month. Haven't got my bill for the repair parts for
        the furnace. Every one said I should put in a claim to the gov. but I
        said "no." Glad that I didn't for I understand that the gov. is turning
        down many of the claims and very slow pay for those that should have
        pay. I've said it before and will say it again. There has never been a
        fine thing done that some one doesn't make a racket and try to get an
        unjust claim.
