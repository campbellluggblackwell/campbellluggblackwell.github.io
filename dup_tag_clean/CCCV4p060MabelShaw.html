        We are glad to greet all our Cousins, Aunts and Uncles from this
        wonderful city of St. Petersburg, Florida, where we have been spending
        the winter at the lovely home of <a href=
        "CampbellThomas1856.html">Uncle Tommie</a> and Aunt <a href=
        "ParksFrances1855.html">Frank Campbell</a>. It is next to being rich
        ourselves to have rich relatives<sup>1</sup> and we are surely enjoying
        ourselves here with them. They keep young and full of pep and, to see
        them, one could not believe that they are to celebrate their "Golden
        Wedding" next Monday, April 12th.
      </p>
      <p>
        For years they have tried to interest us in the wonderful opportunities
        of the "Sunshine City" but it seemed impossible for us to leave home in
        the winter, and besides we had our doubts about all the stories they
        told. We are glad to be here now and find out for ourselves that "the
        half has never been told" even yet. <span wc_id="I773">Llewellyn</span>
        has invested in some land here and has built two houses to sell. This
        is certainly a great place to play and make money while you are
        playing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many northern people think that the "bubble has burst" but if they
        would only come and see for themselves the substantial basis upon which
        Florida, and this city is being built, and the great buildings in
        course of erection, they could not doubt what the future of Florida has
        in store for those who are fortunate enough to invest here.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to statistics Florida entered 1926 with more than nine
        millions of dollars to her credit and without public debt. The State
        levies no State Income or Inheritance Tax. Sixteen southern States did
        one fifth of the building of the United States last year and Florida
        did one third of the one fifth.<sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is of historical interest to note, that, since we have been here,
        the Port of St. Petersburg has been opened and many large ships are
        here all the time. We saw one from Puget Sound the other day and
        thought of the Congdons<sup>3</sup>. The port was dedicated during the
        "Festival of the States" last week, and we listened with great interest
        to the address given by the head of all the shipping interests of the
        world, who came here for the purpose of formally opening the port. St.
        Petersburg is endowed with the closest open port to the Panama Canal on
        the American continent and is owned and controlled by the municipality.

        1. Only a few months later, the Florida real estate "bubble" burst.
        Tommie was a large scale developer who owned many acres of land and had
        invested large sums into providing streets, water, sewer, etc. when the
        demand for new houses suddenly evaporated.--- Eventually his daughters
        sold the land to the city as Campbell Park
      </p>
      <p>
        2. The pace of building was the problem. Small speculators like
        Llewellyn with his 2 houses, and larger ones like Tommie with his many
        blocks under development were playing "build it and they will buy."
        When that becomes widespred, suddenly the supply exceeds the demand.

        Many of the tourists have left for the North, but we see no difference
        for we still have to stand in line for most everything. Two of the
        largest hotels have closed for the season.<sup>4</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is wonderful how the people attend church here. Some of the churches
        have had two morning services and one has to go very early to get a
        seat. The larger churches seat from one thousand to five thousand
        people. One can hardly find a seat at Prayer Meeting in some of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have had the pleasure of listening to three world famous musicians
        this winter, Galli Curci - Fritz Kreisler and Paderewski, also many
        noted speakers. There is some noted speaker every afternoon at Williams
        Park, after the concert by the noted Scotch Highlanders Band, to which
        thousands listen daily.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have taken several trips over the state while we have been here.
        Uncle Tommie, Aunt Frank, Llewellyn and I drove to the East Coast a
        short time ago. We went first to Tampa, crossing the new Gandy bridge
        which is six miles long and considered the longest bridge in the world.
        We then went to Winter Haven, Okeechobee, Palm Beach, Miami, Coral
        Gables and Cocoanut Grove where we visited the home of William Jennings
        Bryan, a quite peaceful place, overlooking the ocean and hidden away
        among the palm trees, Spanish moss and tropical plants. Coral Gables is
        all that it is advertised. We came here by way of Fort Pierce,
        Melbourne, and Kissimee which gave us a fine trip along the ocean. The
        wonderful development of the state gave us an idea of what man has done
        and we could not help but contrast it with another trip which we took.
        We drove forty miles to Tarpon Springs where we found the largest
        sponge industry of the world. From here we took a small boat and went
        sixteen miles up the narrow winding Anolete River into the very heart
        of the jungle with its beautiful old trees filled with Spanish moss and
        vines. The mocking birds were singing in the trees and huge alligators,
        said to be four hundred years old were sunning themselves on the bank.
        All this, with the reflections in the water, as we passed along looked
        like a veritable fairyland, and showed us the state as God made it. No
        wonder the famous Artist, George Innes <span class=
        "Annotation">[sic]</span>, who painted "The Last Hope"<sup>5</sup>,
        chose this place for his permanent home, which is rustic looking.

        the winter months.

        been referring to a painting, titled the <a href=

        thankful that my mother is so well after all she has suffered in the
        past year. She looks fine and young, especially now that her dresses
        have been shortened several times since she came. We are all drinking
        of the "Fountain of Youth" every day.
