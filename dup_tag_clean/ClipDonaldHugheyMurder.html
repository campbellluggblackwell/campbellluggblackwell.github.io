        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp; A shooting incident in a crowded <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakridge,_Oregon">Oakridge</a> bar Friday
        night left one man dead, and his apparent assailant in custody of
        Oakridge police.</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp; Patrons of the bar, Bink's, wrestled the unidentified
        gunman to the floor following the shooting, knocked him unconscious,
        and held him until police arrived, according to Jack Moses, co-owner of
        Bink's.</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp; The dead man is <span wc_id="I1229">Donald
        Hughey</span>, of <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Bay,_Oregon">Winchester
        Bay</a>, a former resident of Oakridge, Moses said. He was brought to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene,_Oregon">Eugene</a> by
        ambulance early this morning and died on the way.</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp; The identity of the arrested man was unavailable from
        police.</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moses said he was tending bar about 11:30 p.m. when a
        man came in, sat at the bar next to Hughey and started arguing for no
        apparent reason. Moses said he walked around the bar and asked the man
        if there was any problem.</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp; "He told me to let go of his arm or he was going to
        shoot the guy," Moses said, "And I looked down and saw he had a pistol
        under Don's armpit."</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moses said he immediately went to call police, and
        while he was on the phone he heard a shot. Returning to the bar, he saw
        Hughey unconscious on the floor, he said.</big>
      </p>
      <p class="SecndP">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp; Several patrons among about 70 in the bar grabbed the
        man, Moses said, and in the struggle the assailant was knocked out and
        one customer was slightly injured.</big>

      <p>
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp; Witnesses told police a man sat down next to Hughey
        in the crowded bar, started arguing with him and then pulled out a gun
        and shot him.</big>
      </p>
      <p>
