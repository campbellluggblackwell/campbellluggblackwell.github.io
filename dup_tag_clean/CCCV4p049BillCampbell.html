        Dear Campbell Cousins:-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        It seems that Spring and the Cousins letter have heretofore been
        synonymous but not so this year in Ann Arbor. Our Spring vacation
        begins next week and if the snow and weather in general permits I will
        be at home in the family.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span wc_id="I905">Mother</span> spent a few days visiting me not long
        ago to remind me that I was twenty one, so we had quite a celebration
        It was her first visit here so I took much pride in showing her "my
        school".
      </p>
      <p>
        This my second year at Michigan and if my plans work out I will have
        four years more. I would like very much to enter the Law School in
        another year and if I do I will have a long schooling cut out for
        myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our family I know have been very well this past year and I sincerely
        hope all of the Cousins have been as fortunate.
