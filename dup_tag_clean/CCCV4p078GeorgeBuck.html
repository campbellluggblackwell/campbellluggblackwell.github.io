        Dear Cousins:-

        "The quests that have etched themselves most satisfactorily into the
        hearts of mankind have been made in voyages from the commonplace to far
        lands of strange beauty, whose harbors have anchored Odysseys from
        unremembered ages."
      </p>
      <p>
        The above I have copied from a "railroad time table". You know there is
        beauty in most everything if you look for it hard enough. Here I am in
        the commonplace of my office starting a Cousins' letter on a voyage,
        not exactly to far lands, but to lands that in the simple days od
        childhood seemed far away to me, and always held a peculiar charm. The
        harbors of these lands may not have anchored odysseys of world renown,
        but I remember the old rafts and a few rowboats at the dam and in the
        race at Nelson, and to me they were an experience and adventure quite
        as impressive as any toilers of the sea that have become immortal in
        the pages of classic literature. And Solomon's temple in all its
        splendor could not have made a greater impression upon any observer
        than Jim Losey's<sup>1</sup> old sawmill always made on me. So after
        all we are for the most part thinking about and writing about the
        relatively simple things that fall within range of our own vision and
        experience.

        Well, to begin with, our mongrel pup, Barney Google, was among the
        fatalities of the heavy auto traffic season last August. We then got a
        lay Irish terrier. She took distemper and passed on in the old
        fashioned way. Had we had the good sense to get a Scotch terrier
        instead, perhaps we might not be so dogless.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have heard something that helps to disprove one of the unpleasant
        references to Scotch blood, and mention it here because Campbells are
        sometimes prone to admit that they are of Scotch descent. This
        particular Scotchman, fearing the approach of the end, was making his
        will. After going over everything, the attorney read the copy as
        prepared, and asked if there were any further changes. "Yes", said the
        Scotchman, "I believe there is. I want you to render a kindness to my
        race. You know they say we Scotch are not generous. To disprove this
        ugly canard you may add a bequest of one thousand dollars to the widow
        of The Unknown Soldier."

        Last summer <span wc_id="I927">Anna</span>, the two boys and I made a
        delightful motor trip through New England. It was the first time any of
        us had visited Maine or seen the White Mountains. When we were eating
        dinner one night at Poland Springs the waitress asked what dignitaries
        we were. We modestly inquired as to why the question. "Why", she said,
        "This is the president's table. You know that both Harding and Coolidge
        were seated at this table when they dined here." The particular reason
        in our case evidently was that this table happened to be the only
        vacant one in the dining room at the time of our arrival.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later in the year, when <a href="CongdonEmma1848.html">mother</a> was
        visiting us. we took another short motor trip to Connecticut. We landed
        in Waterbury on the evening of a prize fight that was said to have
        drawn thirty or forty thousand visitors to the city. Mother was quite
        put out that I had not thought to get tickets to the fight in
        advance.<sup>2</sup>

      <p>
        A month or so ago I happened to attend a conference in Washington, and
        while there sought shelter at the Snavely's. It was most comfortable
        and hospitable shelter and <span wc_id="I1050">Mary</span> throws in
        breakfast.

      <p>
        Our family is well. The boys are continuing their work in high school
        with somewhat varied and indifferent success. Anna continues quite a
        number of outside activities. According to the present day order of
        family organization there isn't much left for the "old man" to do
        except saw wood and keep still.

      <p>
        Our cordial greeting goes to every Cousin. We trust that the year has
        brought things of value in life, even though to some the cost may seem
        out of line. We shall look ahead to the perusal of the various letters
        with a great deal of pleasure.
