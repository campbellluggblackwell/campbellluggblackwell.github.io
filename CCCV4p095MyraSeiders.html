      <p>Dear Cousins:-</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>I have put off writing this letter hoping for time to compose my
        thoughts properly and inspiration for the thoughts but I can't see that
        I am any better off than I was a month ago. I suppose spring is a good
        time for these letters for it gives an opportunity for a good brain
        house cleaning. My brain is so far from being cluttered with thoughts,
        however, there is nothing worth while to clean out.</p>
      <p>This past year has been quite uneventful with us. We have just kept on
        in the race to find our who wins, the collectors, or we, most of the
        time it is about fifty-fifty.<sup>1</sup></p>
      <p><a href="CongdonEmma1848.html">Mother</a> spent the summer with <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">George</a>
        and me last year and we are hoping that she will be down this year.
        While she was with us we made the trip to Gettysburg one day. Those of
        you who have been there know what a wonderful trip it is. We spent some
        time at the Pennsylvania Monument hunting the Campbells who had taken
        part in that battle. Mother will probably tell you how she "struck up"
        an acquaintence with a man who knew <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Cousin
          Tommy</a> and kept his car in the Campbell Garage I believe.</p>
      <p><a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I932">Betty</a>
        - now eight years - is in school every day. She is finishing Third
        Grade. Last year she was neither absent or tardy once but this year she
        was sick two days. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I938">Billy</a>
        - now three years - is a true Scotchman. He always says "dinna" for did
        not; puts his hands behind him as I've seen so many of the older men do
        - <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Uncle Charlie</a> and <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Uncle
          Ed</a> both do - <a href="CampbellJohn1836.html">Uncle John Campbell</a>
        used to.</p>
      <p>I suppose you all know of the great and much talked about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesquicentennial_Exposition">Sesqui
          Centenial</a> to be held in Philadelphia this summer. It seemed a hard
        fight to get the thing under way but now it it is really to be, progress
        is amazingly rapid. President Coolidge is to be here July 5th, I
        believe, and while June was to have been the official opening date the
        President's visit will mark the real opening. When you plan to visit the
        Fair don't forget that we live near and shall be more than glad to see
        you. The great bridge<sup>2</sup> will then be open so if you have your
        car the drive will be nothing - and the train service is always good.</p>
      <p>Trusting that you all had a successful and happy year and that the
        coming one will be even more successful and happy, we are,</p>
