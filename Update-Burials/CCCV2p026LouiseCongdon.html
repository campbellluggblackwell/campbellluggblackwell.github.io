        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p>
        Greetings from California! Wish you might all visit this glorious
        country, -- some of you have and more of you will some day, I hope.
        Words fail me in describing it. You will just have to come and see for
        yourselves.<br>
      </p>
      <p>

        Mother</a> and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I962">
        Bernice</a> and I have been out here for more than two years and love
        it more all the time, -- but regret very much that <a href=
        "CongdonCharles1856.html">papa</a> is so many miles away<sup>1</sup>.
        He visited us here last summer as you all know from his glowing
        <a href="CCCV1R2p41C_H_Congdon.html">report</a> last fall. It was fine
        having him here, only we wish he might have stayed longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have a cunning little cottage on the tip top of Mission Ridge, --
        nine hundred feet above the sea -- overlooking the town of Santa
        Barbara and the old Pacific, with three lovely islands twenty-five
        miles in the distance,(they look to be only five miles away), -- and on
        the other side are the wonderful mountains; -- we look out of the
        window at them.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, we have not gone back to our beautiful Pennsylvania country
        and Mother and I are planning to go back there<sup>2</sup> this summer
        where we can be near papa.
      </p>

        <em></em><em></em>Cousin <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I941">
        Georgia Parks</a> visited us for a short time in January. We enjoyed
        having her so much. It has been a good many years since we had seen
        her.
      </p>
      <p>
        It will be very interesting reading all the spring letters from the
        Cousins. This certainly was a splendid idea of Cousin <a href=
        "SelphWilliam1871.html">Will</a>'s.
      </p>
      <p>
        With love and kindest wishes to all of the Cousins from the "Charlie
        Congdon Family" -- Anna R., Bernice, and Louise,<br>
