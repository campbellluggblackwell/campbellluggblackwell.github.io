        Dear Cousins:

        Greetings, from the We(s)t Side of Washington!<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Montana has been our home for the past twelve years, but we lately
        decided to make a change to the Pacific Coast region, hence the past
        three weeks has <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> found us on the
        move.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wintry scenes of old Montana were left behind us as we dropped down
        over the Rockies into summer sunshine, and, --- <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokane,_Washington">Spokane</a>. This
        is a wonderful little city, -- the old home of my wife, where we
        enjoyed a several days sojourn. I enjoyed mostly viewing the <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokane_Falls">Lower Falls</a> from
        Monroe Street Bridge above which the big concrete bridge of the Chicago
        Milwaukee and St. Paul diagonals Monroe Street Bridge and the canyon,
        the spray from the Falls dashing on us as we stood, -- and the
        wonderful <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Davenport_Hotel_%28Spokane,_Washington%29">
        Davenport Hotel</a> and Restaurant of which I have heard so much, and
        of which too much cannot be said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our trip through the famous <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenatchee,_Washington">Wenatchee
        Valley</a> and the beautiful <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Range">Cascades</a> with their
        abrupt peaks and such masses of dense green foliage, dropping down into
        Everett and glimpsing the Bay for the first time underneath the setting
        sun, then following southward along the <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound">Bay</a> to Seattle where
        darkness overtook us, -- was a sight long to be remembered.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there we came to Tacoma and were entertained in the lovely home of
        the <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Congdon</a> Cousins and were shown
        much of their city and the surrounding country. We also visited the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia,_Washington">Capitol
        City</a> and <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelton,_Washington">Shelton</a>,
        deciding later to locate temporarily in South Tacoma, hoping that the
        fates will favor us here.

      <p>
        In the fall of 1912, being seized with the <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_Acts">homestead</a> craze, I
        left the paternal roof and migrated to the heart of Montana, the
        fertile <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Basin_County,_Montana">Judith
        Basin</a> country in Fergus County, of which Lewistown is the county
        seat. There I secured my three hundred and twenty acres of virgin soil
        and began to establish a stock and grain ranch. There I met a <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1223">
        young lady</a> whose homestead adjoined mine, and some eight years ago
        we decided to combine ranches and travel double harness. We saw great
        possibilities in the cattle industry,

        We have met with varying successes and experiences. Conditions over the
        whole northwest have been more or less abnormal since the closing of
        the world war and we have felt this strongly in some sections of
        Montana until the past year when the usual rainy season of May and June
        was very pronounced, -- vegetation was abundant, and we feel that
        Montana has begun to "come back." It is a state wonderful in its
        resources and, we feel, in its future.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have two fine healthy youngsters, <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1224">
        Elizabeth</a> aged seven, and <a href=
        "http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1229">
        Donald</a> aged five.<sup>1</sup> Elizabeth has been in the saddle
        since before she was five and can handle her horse or a bunch of stock
        better than many grown-ups. Saddle horses are the most convenient way
        of travel in Montana as you can strike a straight line in any direction
        through coulees or over fences. We all ride a great deal and enjoy it.

      <p>
        I think the Cousins Correspondence is a splendid thing and one <a href=
        "HugheyHerbert1857.html">father</a> would have taken great interest in
        had he lived to see it carried out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking forward to reading all your letters in the new edition and
        hoping this finds the Cousins all in the best of health and spirits, in
        which my wife joins, I am

        1. Tragically. Donald was murdered at age 55 while seated at a
        restaurant counter. Shot by someone who didn't even know him, but felt
        like killing someone.--- wbt.
