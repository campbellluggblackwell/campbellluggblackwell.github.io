    <div class="Salutation">
      <p>My dear Cousins:-</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> For the very good reason given by Cousin <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">George
          Buck</a> in his circular letter, if for no other, we should all make a
        special effort to be on time with our letters. Not that an individual
        letter is so important but collectively they mean a lot.</p>
      <p>Living as far away as we do from the old family hearth, and seldom
        hearing from you, we do through this medium of letters keep in very
        close touch with you, and possibly get more kick our of the letters than
        the majority of Cousins; for this selfish reason we trust that the
        efforts of the Officers will be rewarded with 100% results.</p>
      <p>There has nothing of special importance in our family the past year;
        however we are looking forward with a great deal of pleasure to the
        arrival of a daughter in our family the coming summer.&nbsp; <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I908">Henry</a>
        has decided "it is not well for man to live alone" and he is going to
        wed a very charming <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I909">young
          lady</a>, whose home is in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The announcement has
        been made so I am not giving away family secrets. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I916">Bill</a>
        is in school in Ann Arbor, - will be home for Easter vacation soon.</p>
      <p>We have had very little Florida weather here since October and are
        beginning to long for green grass and flowers to take the place of snow
        and ice.</p>
      <p>The tragic death of <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil Young</a> was
        a shock to us and must have been to you all.</p>
      <p><a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I905">Louise</a>
        joins with me in wishing you health and happiness. With much love,</p>
