        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        In imagination I can see the different members of our notable
        organization, coming from the North, the South, the East and the West,
        each with his story of the past year. I think all are here who came
        last year, except for Cousin <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Phil
        Young</a>, whose tragic going we all deplore and most deeply sympathize
        with the family, - and <span wc_id="I1709">
        Gordon Parks</span>, more distantly connected, although <span wc_id="I1707">
        Jim</span> has always seemed one of us<sup>1</sup>; to him also we extend
        sympathy.
      </p>
<p>
        The year passes so quickly when looked at as a unit; we hardly get the
        job of writing the "Cousins Letter" off our conscience before it is
        time to write again, but in looking backward over a whole year we can
        recall many things which have happened, - some glad, some sad, some
        joyful and some sorrowful. I think tho', as I look over it all, it has
        been a beautiful year and I am thankful for the blessings it has given
        me. Right here I am reminded of some lines we used to sing, and they
        apply to the most of us.

        "If you cannot on the ocean sail among the swiftest fleet,"<br/>
        "Rocking on the highest billows, laughing at the storms you meet,"<br/>
        "You can stay among the sailors anchored yet within the bay;"<br/>
        "You can lend a hand to help them as they launch their ship
        away."<sup>2</sup>

        If we are not going out into the world doing big things, we can do much
        right within the bay.

        When I wrote last March, <a href="BuckMyra1884.html">Myra</a> and her
        little <span wc_id="I938">
        son</span> were with me. This month they came again, surprising me. We had
        a good two week visit.
      </p>
<p>
        Last July <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">George</a> came for me and I
        was with them for some time. Northern New Jersey is a beautiful spot,
        over which we too many drives; then we had a long and delightful ride
        up the Hudson to Bear Mountain. I had read about the wonderful new
        bridge there, but never expected to see it; we crossed it, enjoying the
        grand view, both up and down the river. We went up the river as far as
        West Point, gong into the famous old Chapel where we looked as long as
        we cared to at those exquisite memorial windows, the old fashioned
        pews, etc. We then came back to the bridge, crossed over and came down
        the East side of the river, staying over night at Waterbury. I hardly
        think it was intentional on George's part, but we ran into a big prize
        fight there. The town was entertaining 20,000 visitors, so we could
        hardly find a place to sleep. We rode all the next day, reach-

        ing home about midnight, - pretty tired, but it had been worth while,
        for where can one find more beautiful scenery than going up and down
        our lovely Hudson Valley from West Point to New York. I am talking as
        though none of you have been there. While I do not doubt that many of
        you have, it was new and thrilling to me and I felt while there I'd
        like to tell everybody all about it.

        I then went over to Myra's and we conceived the idea of going to
        Gettysburg. It was a pleasant July morning and as we rode mile after
        mile over those grand old Pennsylvania hills, I felt as though I had
        never half known my native state. Of the real battle field I will not
        speak, as it is now a National Park and everyone goes there. It is far
        better seen than described. Just as we were about to leave I stood by
        the place where one of our Generals had stood, watching the battle; my
        attention was called to a man standing there We spoke of how visitors
        were coming in from all over the United States to this place. He said
        "I live in St. Petersburg". Of course I asked him if he knew <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie</a>, - he said he did know Tommie,
        <span wc_id="I1693">
        Curt Shewman</span>, and he even had kept his car in Curt's garage. I
        thought, well, the world is not so large after all. In September, Myra
        and family brought me home, stopping in Marshall Falls, we saw the
        place as well as the folks<sup>3</sup>. We also stopped over night at
        Johnson City and had a very pleasant visit in <span wc_id="I1591">
        Ed</span> and <a href="HookerEva1885.html">Eva Hills</a>' lovely little
        home<sup>4</sup>. I thought then I was home for the rest of the year,
        but the children wrote for me to come and spend the holidays with them,
        so away I started again. We has a family dinner at George's on
        Thanksgiving Day, - then the next Saturday evening George, <span wc_id="I927">
        Anna</span>, and I had the pleasure of being guests at <span wc_id="I1605">
        Doris Selph</span>'s wedding. It was a beautiful wedding and a sweet
        little bride. <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will</a> seemed pleased
        to have two of his old Cousins there, <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Ann
        Owlett</a> and myself. We surely enjoyed being there On Christmas
        morning, George, Anna, and the boys and I drove to Myra's, one hundred
        miles; we arrived in time for dinner and a Happy Christmas.

        On January 16th, I came home to Watkins. There is one more important
        event I want to mention and that is the "Cousins Dinner" at Cousin
        <span wc_id="I1470">
        Will</span> and <a href="TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie Clark</a>'s.
        Everything had been perfectly planned and we had about as near a
        perfect time as we can here on earth. The cold snowy day did not seem
        to effect our spirits, and I think it was seventeen who had stayed over
        that gathered at <a href="SeelyAda1858.html">Ada</a>'s in the evening.
        We were all saddened at the news that <a href="CampbellMary1851.html">Mary Shipman</a> was in the hospital, and we
        missed the five
