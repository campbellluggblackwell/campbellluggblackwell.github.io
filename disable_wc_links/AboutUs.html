        This website is for the descendants of 3 intertwined families —
        <strong>Campbells, Luggs &amp; Blackwells</strong>, all of whom are
        connected to Nelson, Tioga Co., PA. There are now more than 10
        generations of descendants, at least 10,000 living — many of whom are
        not aware of their connection. We want to facilitate reconnecting — and
        getting to know one another while reconnecting with our roots.

        We started as a RootsWeb mail list in the 1980s. Then added a family
        tree on RootsWeb’s WorldConnect pages. In 2000 we re-instituted a
        Campbell Reunion in the Nelson, PA area — (the reunion had long had
        Lugg and Blackwell participation). We created, and continue to add to,
        a family history website that has more than 500 hundred pages of
        photos, old letters, news-clips, diagrams and info on people and places
        in our past. We created a Facebook group, which at the moment has about
        300 members. We’re migrating our family tree data to a huge, shared
        tree, on WikiTree.com and have added more then 5,700 people to WikiTree
        so far.

        Last year we created our own YouTube channel. And, because of the
        COVID-19 pandemic, held our first video-conferenced reunion (via
        ZOOM).  And we're about to launch our own blog. Explore our past -
        and our present.
