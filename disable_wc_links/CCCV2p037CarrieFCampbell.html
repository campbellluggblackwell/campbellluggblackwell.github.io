        Dear Cousins:

        As I review the past months since I last wrote you there seems nothing
        of much interest to tell you about. Undoubtedly many of you know I have
        disposed of our former home here and am now occupying a four-room,
        heated apartment. Certainly this is a great change, but I rather enjoy
        it. One pleasant feature is that I am not more than fifteen minutes
        walk from my son <span wc_id="I1482">
        William</span>'s home, and only a block our of his way to business. As I
        have continued my work at the office, it makes it very nice for me as
        he comes for me in the morning and we return together at night.
      </p>

        Well, Cousins, it is a pleasure to hear from you all as it recalls many
        good times some of us have been favored to enjoy together.
      </p>
<p>
        With very best wishes to you all.
