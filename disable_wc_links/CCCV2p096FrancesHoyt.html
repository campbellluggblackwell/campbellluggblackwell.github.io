<p>
        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        Am very sure that Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a>
        has never been grandmother to three babies<sup>1</sup> with measles or
        he would not have asked me to write a letter even as important as the
        Cousins Correspondence letter.<br/>
</p>
<p>
        We have not only had measles but measles plus. <span wc_id="I1266">
        Baby Henry</span> has had bronchitis and an abscess in both ears and a
        sixteen month old baby with all that trouble is considerable care.
        However, we hope they are all on the road to complete recovery.
      </p>
<p>
        As <span wc_id="I1285">
        Isabelle</span> has written the family letter since I have been
        here<sup>2</sup> you will have to pardon me if we tell the same story.
      </p>
<p>
        Talked with <span wc_id="I1276">
        Betty</span> last evening. They have a dandy <span wc_id="I1282">
        baby boy</span> but think <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Walker-36164">Joseph</a> will always
        come first with his "Gram."<sup>3</sup> He has just had his half term
        examinations and passed all his subjects above ninety, which I think
        pretty good for an eight year old boy.
      </p>
<p>
        Am afraid <span wc_id="I1256">
        Tom</span>, Jess' boy, will not be able to go back to school this year. He
        has a slight valvular heart trouble and measles have left him far from
        strong.
      </p>
<p>
        Isabelle wrote yesterday from Atlantic City that she was enjoying her
        Easter vacation<sup>4</sup> very much She expects to visit Philadelphia
        and Harrisburg on her way home.
      </p>
<p>
        Anticipating much pleasure from the Cousins letters, I extend greetings
        to you all from <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/hoyt-211">Jessica</a> and myself.

        2. Frances lived most of the year with her youngest daughter, Isabelle,
        prioor to Isabelle's death, but my mother [Jessica] was a teacher, so
        she needed childcare when my siblings were sick. I was not yet part of
        the scene in 1924 (nor for quite a while after) - wbt
