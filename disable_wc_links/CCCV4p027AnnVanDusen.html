        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        I surely will make an effort to write this morning; have been notified
        that letters are now due. I have been sick for two weeks and my
        <span wc_id="I1414">
        Grand Boy</span> who stays with me and goes to school at Elkland has also
        been sick so it was impossible to write sooner.
      </p>
<p>
        We have had a good many below zero mornings here in Osceola this
        winter. Yesterday we had sunshine and robins; today it snows hard.<br/>
</p>
<p>
        We had a fine Cousins Dinner at <a href="TubbsMinnie1864.html">Minnie</a>'s on October 20th. I think some
        Cousin will surprise us with invitation for dinner when the year rolls
        round. The First Cousins who have received their pictures certainly
        appreciate <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Cousin Will</a>'s
        thoughtfulness in sending one to each of us. We are all very anxious to
        receive our folios and hear again from all the Cousins.
      </p>
<p>
        The terrible accidental death of Cousin <a href="YoungPhilip1866.html">Philip Young</a> reminds us that life is very
        uncertain.
      </p>
<p>
        Others of my family will write and speak for themselves so I will
        close.
      </p>
<p>
        With love to all,
      </p>
