        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        A hospital doesn't seem a very cheering place from which to send
        greetings - however, it is simply that the Mandeville's <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> have lost another pair of tonsils; <span wc_id="I1563">
        Billy</span>'s this time. He is getting along splendidly, particularly
        with the sign language. In a few days everyone will hear all the gory
        details. His mind seems to work that way. Sometime in the future,
        yellow journalism will have a first class reporter. When <span wc_id="I1560">
        Bill</span> and I returned from a trip recently, his first question was,
        "Did you see any nice accidents?" - on answering "No", he said, "Gee,
        didn't you even see a train wreck?" The trip apparently was a failure
        as far as he was concerned - but not for us. Bill had Grippe and a few
        days in Atlantic City did him worlds of good.<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>
        Our interests haven't changed much since last year, centering in the
        boys of course. Billy is in the second grade and admits that he is one
        of the star pupils only the teacher doesn't know it. It happens that
        way sometimes.
      </p>
<p>
<span wc_id="I1564">
        David</span> is an angelic looking boy (if you don't look too long). Those
        who remember <span wc_id="I1565">
        Jerome</span> in his hectic infancy may have some idea of David. Suffice
        it to say, ours is not a quiet household.
      </p>
<p>
        Bill is, as always, busy with business and public affairs. I think
        everyone knows that <span wc_id="I1551">
        Joe</span> and he are in the same law office.
      </p>
<p>
        When I hear of how active Cousin <span wc_id="I927">
        Anna Buck</span> is in her community, I feel how very useless I am in mine
        Some day I hope to do something worth mentioning.
      </p>
<p>
        We are all very thankful that <span wc_id="I1549">
        Henry</span>, <span wc_id="I1545">
        Pearl</span>'s son, pulled through a very critical illness.
      </p>
<p>
<span wc_id="I1544">
        Mother</span>, aside from colds, has been well this winter. At present her
        house is torn up from top to bottom being redecorated. If she doesn't
        write you will know the cause.
      </p>
<p>
        Love and greetings to all,
      </p>
