        Dear Cousins:-
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        What a pleasure it is going to be to have my visit with you all while
        sitting in the car on this glorious sunshiny afternoon. I am waiting
        for <span wc_id="I1566">
        Mr. Carey</span> to finish his business at the Union Structural Steel
        Plant.<br/>
</p>
<p>
        We came to Syracuse this morning from Elmira, a distance of ninety-two
        miles. With our good New York State roads it makes a very enjoyable
        trip. The hill sides are still gorgeous with autumn coloring, and as we
        went over the hills and through the valleys it all seemed so wonderful
        that I felt thankful to  be living.
      </p>
<p>
        I think that you all know that on January 6, 1920, I married my next
        door neighbor. He has one son, <span wc_id="I1567">
        John B. Jr.</span>, who lives with his <span wc_id="I13638">
        grandmother</span>.
      </p>
<p>
        We have spent a greater part of the time in Pittsburgh, Pa., and the
        past year in Buffalo where Mr. Carey is located. Just at present we
        have opened up our home at 439 West Clinton Street, Elmira, and will be
        here until after Christmas.
      </p>
<p>

        It was an unexpected pleasure to meet Cousin <span wc_id="I948">

        with her at our home.

        I want you all to know that our home is always open to you. I am always
        glad to hear Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie
        Congdon</a>'s voice on the phone as I know then that he will run in
        between trains and we can have a little chat.

        With sincere good wishes for your health and happiness,
