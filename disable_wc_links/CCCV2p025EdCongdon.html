        Dear Cousins, First, Second and Third:
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        How fast the days, weeks, and months are passing. We take no note of
        time but from its loss, -- as we look back over our lives how quickly
        they have passed. I can remember when a small boy seeing a picture on
        the wall in the old homestead of <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Grandfather Campbell</a>'s, representing life
        from childhood to old age, showing the steps from the babe to
        childhood, youth to manhood, and then steps down to old age. As
        one<sup>1</sup> has truly said, when the great Scorer comes to write
        against our name he will not write whether we have won or lost, but how
        we have played the game.<br/>
</p>
<p>
        Since our last Cousins Letter, I have been retired after forty-five
        years service for the Northern Pacific Railway, on a pension commencing
        January 1st, 1924. It seems very good after such a long and continuous
        service to have a well earned rest. <a href="VaughanEmma1854.html">Em</a> and I want to go East this fall and meet
        you all (if God be willing) at the Cousins' Dinner in September. We
        will miss Cousin <span wc_id="I1708">
        Em Parks</span> who recently has passed over the river to be with loved
        ones there. Em was a dear, good woman. <span wc_id="I1707">
        Jim</span> and her brothers and sisters have our deepest sympathy.
      </p>
<p>
        We expect to spend the summer here doing a little garden and lawn work.
        We hope to be able to do some good in the world yet, and if all is
        well, spend next winter in California. Em belongs to several clubs
        which take part of her time and keep her from getting rusty. There is a
        bright side to life and we have had many things to brighten our way,
        and we are to blame ourselves if we do not get some of the <u>joy out
        of life</u>. So my advice to the younger generations is to first get
        the right viewpoint of life and then play the game straight and you
        will surely win.
      </p>
<p>
        How we did enjoy the last Letters, especially from the second and third
        cousins whom we have never met, -- a good many of them not born when we
        left good old Pennsylvania. Though the most of our lives have been
        spent in Minnesota and Washington our minds go back to our native state
        and childhood days and the dear Cousins.
      </p>
<p>
<em></em><em></em>We send you all a hearty greeting from the good old
        State of Washington, with lots of love. This is a beautiful spring
        morning, -- the old earth putting our new life, birds singing, trees
        and flowers in bloom. We have also had a fine winter, no snow and not
        much rain.
      </p>
