        Dear Cousins:
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        The time has come to write another letter to our Cousins. I enjoyed the
        letter and pictures so much. Some of the second Cousin's children I
        have never seen, -- of course, those residing in the West. I hope we
        will get the rest of the pictures this time.<br/>
</p>
<p>
        Well, I guess the Cousins in Osceola are as well as usual. I do not see
        the others very often. We go down to Nelson once in a while.
      </p>
<p>
        We have been having quite a snowstorm for April fool, -- it snowed all
        day here. The farmers came into farmers came into town with sleigh.
      </p>
<p>
        Well, there is not very much I think of to write about. I stay at home
        in the winter. Quite a good run of <span class="Annotation">[maple]</span> sap. Sister <a href="TubbsAnn1855.html">Ann</a> has five trees tapped and is very busy
        making syrup. <span wc_id="I1608">
        Alta</span> was here a few days ago for a short visit. <a href="SelphJennie1873.html">Jennie Cady</a> has not been here this winter.
      </p>
<p>
        I hope we can all go to the Cousins Dinner this year. It will be a
        grand trip by auto<sup>1</sup>.
      </p>
<p>
<em></em><em></em>My family are all well, except colds, which are very
        common.
      </p>
<p>
        I hope all fifty Cousins will get their letter in for this report, --
        they only have one to do this year, -- a very good plan. They see each
        other once a year at the Reunion<sup>2</sup>. I try to attend the
        Reunion every year. I will go as long as I can, <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Ma</a> planned on the reunion every year as
        long as she could go.
      </p>
<p>
        Will close with these few lines. Do not think of anything more.<br/>

        1. To be held at Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie
        Congdon</a>'s summer home, in Marshalls Falls, PA (near Stroudsburg).
        But for some that was to far so they attended an alternate dinner held
        locally at the home of <span wc_id="I1057">

        2. The Reunions, held in or near Nelson in the summer, were for
        descendants of the 1748 Joseph Campbell, but Luggs &amp; Blackwells
        were encouraged to attend. The Cousins Dinners were held at more widely
        scattered locations, often in early fall, and were for the descendants
        of the 1793 Joseph Campbell, and were by invitation only.
