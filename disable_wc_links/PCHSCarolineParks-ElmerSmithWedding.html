      12,  Miss <span wc_id="I1718">
      Caroline Parks</span>, daughter of <span wc_id="I1717">
      Mrs. Mary Parks</span>, of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tioga_Township,_Tioga_County,_Pennsylvania">
      Tioga</a> was united in marriage to Mr. <span wc_id="I1719">
      Elmer B. Smith</span>, brother of Mrs. H. M. Kemp of this place, and one of
      Tioga's most respected young men. The ceremony was performed at the home
      of the bride's mother and was attended only by the immediate relatives of
      the young people.<br/>
          The house was profusely decorated with flowers and
      potted plants. At 9 o'clock the wedding march was played by Mrs. E. D.
      Brigham and the couple were united in marriage under an arch of
      evergreens by Rev. Wm. C. McCormick, the Presbyterian clergyman.<br/>
          After the ceremony and congratulations a bounteous
      wedding feast was served. The young people are two of Tioga's most
      respected young people and the best wishes of a host of friends go with
      them on their voyage through life.<br/>
