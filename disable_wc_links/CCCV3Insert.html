        Dear Cousin:
      </p>
</div>
<div class="Message">
<p>
        On page 100 is an explanation of the cost of production of this book.
        The desire is to get away from a rigid form of rendering a bill for
        each book; and yet if we are to perpetuate the scheme somebody must
        foot the bills. It is not the intention to amplify here the thought on
        page 100. I hope the sentiment which I have tried to express on that
        page will have an appeal. Won't you please reread that page? If for
        each book manufactured three dollars is remitted, the cost of the
        edition will be met. Where, through duplication of books within a
        family or household, a smaller average remittance is justified--and it
        would be justified in several cases--it is hoped that the deficit so
        caused may be made up by others so circumstanced and so disposed that
        they can conveniently and cheerfully lend this encouragement to the
        plan. Should the aggregate remittance exceed the total cost of the
        edition, the balance will be held to reduce the cost of the next
        volume.
      </p>
<p>
        Please send your remittance to <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bosard-8">Mary Snavely</a>,<br/>
<br/>
                   Mrs. A. B.
        Snavely,<br/>
                   211 Tenth
        Street, N.E.,<br/>

<br/>
        It would be appreciated if the settlements could be made with
        reasonable promptness, as personal funds have been advanced for the
        production expenses.
