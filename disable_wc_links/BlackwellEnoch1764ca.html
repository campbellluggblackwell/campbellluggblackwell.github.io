      Enoch Blackwell (ca 1764 - 1816)
    </h1>
<div>
<p>
        Enoch was born abt. 1764 in Avening, Gloucestershire, Eng., d. Jun. 3,
        1816 in Jersey Shore, Lycoming Co., PA. In some versions of the oral
        history, his birthplace was transformed to "Haven Parish". <span class="Annotation">[It's really <a href="http://www.aveningchurch.info/">Avening</a>, I've been there and to
        Horsley.-wbt.]</span> Enoch's parents were <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-2569">John Blackwell</a>, b.
        May 1733/34 in <a href="http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/place_page.jsp?p_id=10883">Horsley</a>,
        Gloucestershire, Eng., d. Nov. 22, 1824 in England; and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cole-14464">Sarah Cole</a>, b. Abt. 1742
        in Avening, d. there Jun. 23, 1789. Enoch was the 2nd of 10 children.
        <span class="Annotation">[The Anglican church in Horsley has many
        Blackwells on its list of WW1 &amp; WW2 veterans. And the graveyard has
        a fairly recent tombstone for a Blackwell who was its
        sexton.-wbt]</span>
</p>
<p>
        He first married <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Perrin-2443">Hannah Perrine</a> (or
        Perrin) Dec. 3, 1787 in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minchinhampton">Minchinhampton</a>,
        Gloucestershire [several of our Clinch cousins were born there], died
        in England after 1800, but before Enoch emigrated in 1804. Sometimes
        her name is given as "Mary Perrine". She was a daughter of <span wc_id="I2438">
        John Perrine</span> and <span wc_id="I2439">
        Sarah Ryder</span>.
      </p>
<p>
        The Blackwells owned textile mills around the nearby community of
        <a href="http://www.cotswolds.com/travel-guide/towns-villages/towns-and-villages-directory/articletype/articleview/articleid/236/nailsworth">
        Nailsworth</a>, but the industry went through a number of boom and bust
        cycles. Several of the Blackwells participated in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Township,_Lycoming_County,_Pennsylvania">
        The English Company</a>, a group of investors who bought more than
        110,000 acres of wilderness in Lycoming Co., PA, intending to farm
        there. A key organizer of the English Company was the <span wc_id="I2679">
        Rev. John Hey</span>. One of Enoch's sons accompanied Rev. Hey to
        Philadelphia to buy the land. One of Enoch's brothers, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-2952">Joshua</a>, married Rev.
        Hey's daughter, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hey-182">Amelia</a>. <span class="Annotation"></span>Two communities were established, both of which
        failed because the heavily wooded hills' soil would not support the
        kind of farming they knew. But Enoch later became wealthy logging it
      </p>
<p>
        In 1804, Enoch, all his children, and some of his siblings sailed from
        Bristol to Philadelphia. Also on board were neighbors from Avening
        (it's a small village) --- <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Clinch-347">Thomas Clinch</a>, his wife,
        <a href="LuggSarah1778.html">Sarah Lugg</a>, and baby daughter,
        <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann Clinch</a>.
      </p>
<p>
        In 1805, Thomas Clinch died. Widower Enoch, and now widow Sarah, were
        married Sept 9, 1805, in Jersey Shore, Lycoming Co. Sarah gave daughter
        Ann to the care of one of Enoch's brother's and his wife. Ann's
        daughter, <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Jane CAMPBELL</a> Tubbs, said
        it was <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blackwell-2573">Peter
        Blackwell</a>. <span class="Annotation">[Amateur genealogist <span wc_id="I2956">
        Stella MAUGERI</span> Blackwell believed it was Joshua and Amelia Hey
        Blackwell.]</span>
</p>
<p>
        Enoch and Sarah settled in Pine Twp., Lycoming Co., where their first
        child, <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary Blackwell</a> was born.
        Enoch became a wealthy lumberman, owning a lot of property around Pine
        Creek. Later they moved to Jersey Shore, where their 2nd child,
        <a href="BlackwellEnoch1814.html">Enoch Blackwell</a> was born. In the
        spring, the elder Enoch would take rafts of logs downstream to sell in
        Williamsport or Harrisburg. In 1816, trying to break up a log jam he
        fell into the chilly waters of the creek, got pneumonia, and died in
        Jersey Shore June 3, 1816.
